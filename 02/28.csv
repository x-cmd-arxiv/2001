effect in OH undertaken with the ATNF Parkes 64-m radio telescope and the NRAO
Green Bank 43-m radio telescope. The Zeeman effect was clearly detected in the
cloud associated with the HII region RCW 38, with a field strength of 38+/-3
micro-Gauss, and possibly detected in a cloud associated with the HII region
RCW 57, with a field strength of -203+/-24 micro-Gauss. The remaining 21
measurements give formal upper limits to the magnetic field strength, with
typical 1-sigma sensitivities <20 micro-Gauss. For 22 of the molecular clouds
we are also able to determine thecolumn density of the gas in which we have
made a sensitive search for the Zeeman effect. We combine these results with
previous Zeeman studies of 29 molecular clouds, most of which were compiled by
Crutcher (1999), for a comparsion of theoretical models with the data. This
comparison implies that if the clouds can be modeled as initially spherical
with uniform magnetic fields and densities that evolve to their final
equilibrium state assuming flux-freezing then the typical cloud is magnetically
supercritical, as was found by Crutcher (1999). If the clouds can be modeled as
highly flattened sheets threaded by uniform perpendicular fields, then the
typical cloud is approximately magnetically critical, in agreement with Shu et
al. (1999), but only if the true values of the field for the non-detections are
close to the 3-sigma upper limits. If instead these values are significantly
lower (for example, similar to the 1-sigma limits), then the typical cloud is
generally magnetically supercritical.

pre-main-sequence stars UX Ori and CQ Tau at 7mm, 3.6cm, and 6cm. These stars
are members of the UX Ori variability class, where the origin of optical
variability is thought to derive from inhomogeneities in circumstellar disks.
Both stars are detected at 7mm but not at longer wavelengths, which confirms
that the millimeter emission is dominated by dust.
  The UX Ori system exhibits a remarkably flat spectral index in the millimeter
range, with alpha_mm 2 (F_nu nu^alpha_mm). Two different disk models can
reproduce this property: i) a physically small disk with optically thick
emission, truncated at a radius about 30 AU, or ii) a massive (~0.3-1 Msun)
disk mainly composed of dust particles grown to radii of 10cm (``pebbles'').
The observations do not spatially resolve the 7mm emission. We discuss
implications of these two models and suggest observational tests that will
discriminate between them.
  The CQ Tau system exhibits a spectral index in the millimeter range of
alpha_mm 2.6, consistent with values commonly found for disks around
pre-main-sequence stars. The observations marginally resolve the 7mm emission
as an elongated structure with full width at half maximum of 2.4""x1.1"" (240x110

the situation in which initially a non-perturbatively large energy density is
localized in a band of high energy quantum modes and are coined tsunami-waves.
The self-consistent evolution of this quantum state and the scale factor is
studied analytically and numerically. It is shown that the time evolution of
these quantum states lead to two consecutive stages of inflation under
conditions that are the quantum analogue of slow-roll. The evolution of the
scale factor during the first stage has new features that are characteristic of
the quantum state. During this initial stage the quantum fluctuations in the
highly excited band build up an effective homogeneous condensate with a non-
perturbatively large amplitude as a consequence of the large number of quanta.
The second stage of inflation is similar to the usual classical chaotic
scenario but driven by this effective condensate.The excited quantum modes are
already superhorizon in the first stage and do not affect the power spectrum of
scalar perturbations. Thus, this tsunami quantum state provides a field
theoretical justification for chaotic scenarios driven by a classical
homogeneous scalar field of large amplitude.

  Background","19 pages, plus 20 postscript figures. Accepted by ApJ",,"10.1086/321475",,"astro-ph",,"  Molecular-line observations of star-forming cloud cores indicate that they
are not the flattened structures traditionally considered by theory. Rather,
they are elongated, perhaps in the direction of their internal magnetic field.
We are thus motivated to consider the structure and evolution of axisymmetric,
magnetized clouds that start from a variety of initial states, both flattened
(oblate) and elongated (prolate). We devise a new technique, dubbed the
$q$-method, that allows us to construct magnetostatic equilibria of any
specified shape. We find, in agreement with previous authors, that the field
lines in oblate clouds bend inward. However, those in prolate clouds bow
outward, confining the structures through magnetic tension.
  We next follow the quasi-static evolution of these clouds via ambipolar
diffusion, under the assumption of constant core mass. An oblate cloud either
relaxes to a magnetically force-free sphere or, if sufficiently massive,
flattens along its polar axis as its central density runs away. A prolate cloud
always relaxes to a sphere of modest central density. We finally consider the
evolution of an initially spherical cloud subject to the tidal gravity of
neighboring bodies. Although the structure constricts equatorially, it also
shortens along the pole, so that it ultimately flattens on the way to collapse.
In summary, none of our initial states can evolve to the point of collapse
while maintaining an elongated shape. We speculate that this situation will
change once we allow the cloud to gain mass from its environment.

same thermal ionization instability as Hydrogen and Helium disks. We argue that
the instability applies to disks of any metal content. The relevance of the
instability to supernova fallback disks probably means that their power-law
evolution breaks down when they first become neutral. We construct simple
analytical models for the viscous evolution of fallback disks to show that it
is possible for these disks to become neutral when they are still young (ages
of a few 10^3 to 10^4 years), compact in size (a few 10^9 cm to 10^11 cm) and
generally accreting at sub-Eddington rates (Mdot ~ a few 10^14 - 10^18 g/s).
Based on recent results on the nature of viscosity in the disks of close
binaries, we argue that this time may also correspond to the end of the disk
activity period. Indeed, in the absence of a significant source of viscosity in
the neutral phase, the entire disk will likely turn to dust and become passive.
We discuss various applications of the evolutionary model, including anomalous
X-ray pulsars and young radio pulsars. Our analysis indicates that metal-rich
fallback disks around newly-born neutron stars and black holes become neutral
generally inside the tidal truncation radius (Roche limit) for planets, at
\~10^11 cm. Consequently, the efficiency of the planetary formation process in
this context will mostly depend on the ability of the resulting disk of rocks
to spread via collisions beyond the Roche limit. It appears easier for the
merger product of a doubly degenerate binary, whether it is a massive white
dwarf or a neutron star, to harbor planets because it can spread beyond the
Roche limit before becoming neutral.[Abridged]

and exhibit a very wide variety of properties. SNe II-L tend to show evidence
of late-time interaction with circumstellar material. SNe IIn are distinguished
by relatively narrow emission lines with little or no P-Cygni absorption
component and (quite often) slowly declining light curves; they probably have
unusually dense circumstellar gas with which the ejecta interact. Some SNe IIn,
however, might not be genuine SNe, but rather are ``impostors'' ---
specifically, super-outbursts of luminous blue variables. SNe Ib do not exhibit
the deep 6150 Angstrom absorption characteristic of ``classical'' SNe Ia;
instead, their early-time spectra have He I absorption lines. SNe Ic appear
similar to SNe Ib, but lack the helium lines as well. Spectra of SNe IIb
initially exhibit hydrogen, yet gradually evolve to resemble those of SNe Ib;
their progenitors seem to contain only a low-mass skin of hydrogen.

core-collapse SNe, the asymmetry (indicated by the amount of polarization)
seems to increase. There is intriguing, but inconclusive, evidence that some
peculiar SNe IIn might be associated with gamma-ray bursts. The rates of
different kinds of SNe as a function of Hubble type are still relatively poorly
known, although there are good prospects for future improvement.

dissipation of the kinetic energy of a highly relativistic fireball.
Photo-meson interactions of protons with gamma-rays within the fireball
dissipation region are expected to convert a significant fraction of fireball
energy to >10^14 eV neutrinos. We present an analysis of the internal shock
model of GRBs, where production of synchrotron photons and photo-meson
neutrinos are self-consistently calculated, and show that the fraction of
fireball energy converted to high energy neutrinos is not sensitive to
uncertainties in fireball model parameters, such as the expansion Lorentz
factor and characteristic variability time. This is due in part to the
constraints imposed on fireball parameters by observed GRB characteristics, and
in part to the fact that for parameter values for which the photo-meson optical
depth is high (implying high proton energy loss to pion production) neutrino
production is suppressed by pion and muon synchrotron losses. The neutrino flux
is therefore expected to be correlated mainly with the observed gamma-ray flux.
The time averaged neutrino intensity predicted by the model, ~10^-8.5 GeV/cm^2
s sr, is consistent with the flux predicted by the assumption that GRBs are the
sources of >10^19 eV cosmic-rays.

of new VLT-UVES high resolution data (R=45000, S/N = 40-60, \lambda\lambda
3050-10000 \AA). Three main components, spanning about 300 km/s, can be
individuated in the Lyman limit system at z~1.92. They show a surprisingly
large variation in metallicities, respectively ~1/500, 1/8 and 1/100 solar. The
large value found for the second component at z=1.9259, suggests that the line
of sight crosses a star-forming region. In addition, there is a definite
correlation between velocity position and ionisation state in this component,
which we interpret as a possible signature of an expanding H II region. The
systems at z~1.94 and z~1.87 have also high metallicity, ~1/4 and 1/3 solar. We
find that photoionisation and collisional ionisation are equal alternatives to
explain the high excitation phase revealed by O VI absorption, seen in these
two systems. From the width of the Si IV, C IV, Si III and C III lines in the
system at z~1.87, we can estimate the temperature of the gas to be log T ~ 4.7,
excluding collisional ionisation. Finally, we compute the Si IV/C IV ratio for
all Voigt profile components in a sample of log N(C IV) > 14 systems at z < 2.
The values show a dispersion of more than an order of magnitude and most of
them are much larger than what is observed for weaker systems. This is probably
an indication that high column density systems preferably originate in galactic
halos and are mostly influenced by local ionising sources.

This problem is mapped onto a non-Hermitian Anderson model with binary
disorder. We develop very efficient numerical tools to enumerate and
characterize even-visiting walks. The number of closed walks is obtained as an
exact integer up to 1828 steps, i.e., some $10^{535}$ walks. On the analytical
side, the concepts and techniques of one-dimensional disordered systems allow
to obtain explicit asymptotic estimates for the number of closed walks of $4k$
steps up to an absolute prefactor of order unity, which is determined
numerically. All the cumulants of the maximum height reached by such walks are
shown to grow as $k^{1/3}$, with exactly known prefactors. These results
illustrate the tight relationship between even-visiting walks, trapping models,
and the Lifshitz tails of disordered electron or phonon spectra.

exists a well-defined ``mass gap'' in momentum space, which in turn leads to
the exponential decay of the operator in coordinate space for any finite $k$.
This mass gap in the free fermion operator suggests that the operator is local
for sufficiently weak background gauge fields. We in fact establish a finite
locality domain of gauge field strength for
$\Gamma_{5}=\gamma_{5}-(a\gamma_{5}D)^{2k+1}$ for any finite $k$, which is
sufficient for the cohomological analyses of chiral gauge theory. We also

formalism. Based on careful analyses of several models, we give clear answers
to the following three fundamental questions: (i) What is the difference
between the LF chiral transformation and the ordinary chiral transformation?
(ii) How does a gap equation for the chiral condensate emerge? (iii) What is
the consequence of the coexistence of a nonzero chiral condensate and the
trivial Fock vacuum? The answer to Question (i) is given through a classical
analysis of each model. Question (ii) is answered based on our recognition of
the importance of characteristic constraints, such as the zero-mode and
fermionic constraints. Question (iii) is intimately related to another
important problem, reconciliation of the nonzero chiral condensate and the
invariance of the vacuum under the LF chiral transformation. This and Question
(iii) are understood in terms of the modified chiral transformation laws of the
dependent variables. The characteristic ways in which the chiral symmetry
breaking is realized are that the chiral charge is no longer conserved and that
the transformation of the scalar and pseudoscalar fields is modified. We also
discuss other outcomes, such as the light-cone wave function of the
pseudoscalar meson in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model.

regarding the classical stability of the corresponding polarized states. In
this work, we study this issue with respect to the solutions presented in

the perturbation of a topological closed string by itself, where the
associative OPE product is deformed, and which is governed by the WDVV
equations. Our main interest will be closed strings that arise as the boundary
theory for topological open membranes, where the boundary string is deformed by
the bulk membrane operators. The main example is the topological open membrane
theory with a nonzero 3-form field in the bulk. In this case the Lie bracket of
the current algebra is deformed, leading in general to a correction of the
Jacobi identity. We identify these deformations in terms of deformation theory.
To this end we describe the deformation of the algebraic structure of the
closed string, given by the BRST operator, the associative product and the Lie
bracket. Quite remarkably, we find that there are three classes of deformations
for the closed string, two of which are exemplified by the WDVV theory and the
topological open membrane. The third class remains largely mysterious, as we
have no explicit example.

detectors and lossy transmission of photons. Combined with single-qubit gates,
they can be used for producing arbitrary polarization states and for designing
various quantum measurements.

structured reservoir of quantum EM field modes, with particular relevance to
atoms interacting with the field in high Q cavities or photonic band gap
materials. In cases such as the former, we show that the pseudo mode theory for
single quantum reservoir excitations can be obtained by applying the Fano
diagonalisation method to a system in which the atomic transitions are coupled
to a discrete set of (cavity) quasimodes, which in turn are coupled to a
continuum set of (external) quasimodes with slowly varying coupling constants
and continuum mode density. Each pseudomode can be identified with a discrete
quasimode, which gives structure to the actual reservoir of true modes via the
expressions for the equivalent atom-true mode coupling constants. The quasimode
theory enables cases of multiple excitation of the reservoir to now be treated
via Markovian master equations for the atom-discrete quasimode system.
Applications of the theory to one, two and many discrete quasimodes are made.
For a simple photonic band gap model, where the reservoir structure is
associated with the true mode density rather than the coupling constants, the
single quantum excitation case appears to be equivalent to a case with two
discrete quasimodes.
