observed when the age of the universe was only 1.3 Gyr. It shows complex low-

a lower limit on C and an upper limit on Ni: [N/H] = -3.07 +/- 0.15, [O/H] =

1/90 solar, shows that this very young absorber (< 1.3 Gyr) has already
experienced a significant metal enrichment. The [O/Si] ratio is nearly solar
suggesting a limited amount of dust, the relative [Si,O/Fe] abundance ratios
show a similar enhancement as observed in the Milky Way stars with comparable

two different couplings, one during the pre-eclipse dips and the other during
the normal state of the source, using a method which directly compares the
low-frequency power-density spectra (PDS) with those of the sidebands around
the coherent pulse frequency. The pre-eclipse dip lightcurves show significant
time variation of photon counts, and this variation appears in the PDS as both
strong mHz powers and well-developed sidebands around the coherent pulse
frequency. The linear correlation coefficients between the mHz PDS and the
sideband PDS obtained from two pre-eclipse dip data segments are 0.880 +- 0.003
and 0.982 +- 0.001, respectively. This very strong coupling demonstrates that
the amplitudes of the coherent pulsations are almost exactly modulated by the
aperiodic variabilities, suggesting that both the periodic and aperiodic
variabilities are related to time variation of obscuration of X-rays from the
central pulsar by an accretion disk during pre-eclipse dips. We also found weak
coupling during the normal state of the source, together with ~12-mHz QPOs. The
normal state coupling seems to reconcile with the prediction that the aperiodic
variabilities from X-ray binary pulsars are due to time-varying accretion flows
onto the pulsar's magnetic poles. If the ~12-mHz QPOs are due to global-normal
disk oscillations caused by the gravitational interactions between the central

linked to hydrogen ionization and is significantly changed when irradiation of
the disc by X-rays from the inner regions is included. We present the first
numerically reliable, physically consistent calculations of the outburst cycles
which include the effects of accretion disc irradiation. The decay from
outburst is governed by irradiation, as pointed out by King & Ritter (1998),
leading to slow exponential decays. At the end of the outburst, the disc is
severely depleted, which lengthens the time needed to rebuild mass to the
critical density for an outburst. Despite this, the long recurrence times and
quiescent X-ray luminosities of SXTs still require the inner disc to be
replaced by another type of flow in quiescence, presumably a hot advection
dominated accretion flow (ADAF). We include the effects of such truncation and
show that the resulting lightcurves are conclusively similar to those of SXTs
like A0620-00. We conclude that the two-alpha disc instability model provides
an adequate description of the outbursts of SXTs when both truncation and
irradiation are included. The values for the viscosities in outburst and in
quiescence are comparable to those used in CVs. We discuss the model in the
context of present observations.

Appears in Nature, 22 Feb, 2001 (Vol 409)",,"10.1038/35059014",,"astro-ph",,"  A star forms when a cloud of dust and gas collapses. It is generally believed
that this collapse first produces a flattened rotating disk, through which
matter is fed onto the embryonic star at the center of the disk. When the
temperature and density at the center of the star pass a critical threshold,
thermonuclear fusion begins. The remaining disk, which can still contain up to
0.3 times the mass of the star, is then sculpted and eventually dissipated by
the radiation and wind from the newborn star. Unfortunately this picture of the
structure and evolution of the disk remains speculative because of the lack of
morphological data of sufficient resolution and uncertainties regarding the
underlying physical processes. Here we present resolved images of a young star,
LkHa 101 in which the structure of the inner accretion disk is resolved. We
find that the disk is almost face-on, with a central gap (or cavity) and a hot
inner edge. The cavity is bigger than previous theoretical predictions, and we
infer that the position of the inner edge is probably determined by sublimation
of dust grains by direct stellar radiation, rather than by disk reprocessing or
the viscous heating processes as usually assumed.

distant radio sources (QSOs and radio galaxies) due to MACHOs, and discuss
their implications for VERA (VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry). First we
show that in case of astrometric microlensing of distant sources, the event
duration is only a function of the lens mass and tangential velocity, but
independent of the lens distance, in contrast to the well-known three-fold
degeneracy for photometric microlensing. Moreover, the lens mass $M$ is scaled
by the tangential velocity $v_\perp$ as $M\propto v_\perp$, rather than
$M\propto v_\perp^2$ which is the case for photometric microlensing. Thus, in
astrometric microlensing the dependence of the lens mass on the unknown
parameter $v_\perp$ is weaker, indicating that the duration of astrometric
microlensing event is a better quantity to study the mass of lensing objects
than that of photometric microlensing. We also calculate the optical depth and
event rate, and show that within 20$^\circ$ of the galactic center a typical
event rate for 10 $\mu$as-level shift is larger than $2.5 \times 10^{-4}$ event
per year, assuming that a quarter of the halo is made up with MACHOs. This
indicates that if one monitors a few hundred sources for $\sim$20 years, such
an astrometric microlensing event is detectable. Since a typical event duration
is found to be fairly long (5 to 15 years), the frequency of the monitoring
observation can be relatively low, i.e., once per six months, which is rather
reasonable for practical observations. We discuss practical strategy for
observing astrometric microlensing with VERA, and argue that an astrometric
microlensing event due to MACHOs can be detected by VERA within a few decades.

HI cloud with heliocentric velocity --23 \kms are consistent with this gas
having been associated with Phoenix in the past, and lost by the galaxy after
the last event of star formation in the galaxy, about 100 Myr ago. Two possible
scenarios are discussed: the ejection of the gas by the energy released by the
SNe produced in that last event of star formation, and a ram-pressure stripping
scenario. Both in the SNe ejection case and in the ram-pressure sweeping
scenario, the distances and relative velocities imply that the HI cloud is not
gravitationally bound to Phoenix, since this would require a Phoenix total mass
about an order of magnitude larger than its total estimated mass. Finally, we
discuss the possibility that Phoenix may be a bound Milky Way satellite. The

the effect of the treatment of convection, and found it relevant for contact
and supernova order in Case A systems, particularly for the highest considered
masses. For Case B systems we find contact for initial periods above

increased fraction of the donor's convective envelope. As most In all Cases we

Starting from the
basic fluid-dynamical equations in three dimensions, I derive the fundamental
set of one-dimensional equations that describe how the mass, angular momentum
and eccentricity vector of a thin disc evolve as a result of internal stresses
and external forcing. The analysis is asymptotically exact in the limit of a
thin disc, and allows for slowly varying eccentricities of arbitrary magnitude.
The theory is worked out in detail for a Maxwellian viscoelastic model of the
turbulent stress in an accretion disc. This generalizes the conventional alpha
viscosity model to account for the non-zero relaxation time of the turbulence,
and is physically motivated by a consideration of the nature of
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. It is confirmed that circular discs are
typically viscously unstable to eccentric perturbations, as found by
Lyubarskij, Postnov & Prokhorov, if the conventional alpha viscosity model is
adopted. However, the instability can usually be suppressed by introducing a
sufficient relaxation time and/or bulk viscosity. It is then shown that an
initially uniformly eccentric disc does not retain its eccentricity as had been
suggested by previous analyses. The evolutionary equations should be useful in
many applications, including understanding the origin of planetary
eccentricities and testing theories of quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray
binaries.

in the central region of the merger remnant (inside 300 pc). Part of the gas
falls to the center, channeled by a tidally induced bar in the more massive

accumulates in dense knots within tidal tails which could lead to the formation
of open clusters or dwarf satellites. Later on, the gas knots loose angular
momentum by dynamical friction and also sink to the center of the remnant,

chain formed by the merging ACO clusters A3528-A3530-A3532, located in the
central region of the Shapley Concentration. Simultaneous 13 cm observations
are also presented. Our final catalogue includes a total of 106 radio sources
above the flux density limit of 0.8 mJy. By cross correlation with optical and
spectroscopic catalogues we found 32 optical counterparts, nine of them
belonging tothe A3528 complex. We explored the effects of cluster mergers on
the radio emission properties of radio galaxies by means of the radio
luminosity function (RLF) and radio source counts. We found that the radio
source counts are consistent with the background counts, as already found for
the A3558 complex (Paper III). The RLF for this complex is consistent, both in
shape and normalisation, with the general cluster luminosity function for
early-type galaxies derived by Ledlow & Owen (LO96). This result is different
from what we obtained for the A3558 merging complex, whose RLF is significantly
lower than LO96. We propose that the different stage of the merger is
responsible for the different RLFs in the two cluster complexes in the core of
the Shapley Concentration. The early stage of merger for the A3528 complex,
proposed by many authors, may have not yet affected the radio properties of
cluster galaxies, while in the more much advanced merger in the A3558 region we
actually see the effects of this process on the radio emission.

these simulations predict. A solution to this problem is proposed here by
assuming that jets with high mass flux originate in a central source which
produces a noncollimated outflow provided that this source is surrounded by a
rapidly rotating accretion disk. The relatively faster rotating disk produces a
collimated wind which then forces all the enclosed outflow from the central
source to be collimated too. This conclusion is confirmed by self-consistent
numerical solutions of the full set of the MHD equations.

stability of the N\'eel state has been explored for all cases from the square
lattice to the isotropic checkerboard lattice. Away from the isotropic limit
and within the linear spin wave approximation, it is shown that there exists a
critical coupling for which the local magnetization of the N\'eel state
vanishes for any value of the spin $S$. One the other hand, using the
Dyson-Maleev approximation, this result is valid only in the case $S= \frac12$

valence bond solid build with disconnected 4-spins singlets. This analysis
indicates that for low spin and in the isotropic limit, the checkerboard

expected transition from the single-particle analysis is reproduced. Generally
speaking, interaction does not alter the incommensurate transition. For
commensurate densities, we map out the entire phase diagram and find that the

infinite small fluctuations -- in contrast to the case of incommensurate

inverted mass hierarchy (RIMH). The RIMH models arise naturally within the
context of SUSY SO(10) grand unified theories. In their original form, RIMH
models suffer from two problems: 1.) obtaining the radiative breakdown of
electroweak symmetry, and 2.) generating the correct masses for third
generation fermions. The first problem can be solved by the introduction of
SO(10) D-term contributions to scalar masses. We show that correct fermion
masses can indeed be obtained, but at the cost of limiting the magnitude of the
hierarchy that can be generated. We go on to compute predictions for the
neutralino relic density as well as for the rate for the decay $b\to s\gamma$,

show that only a tiny corner of model parameter space is accessible to Fermilab

recently conjectured QCD domain walls or similar CP violating domain walls with
QCD scale structure. Such domain walls align the electric and magnetic dipole
moments of the nucleons shortly after the QCD phase transition, producing
electromagnetic fields correlated along the domain walls. Through the Kibble
mechanism, the domain walls attain Hubble-scale correlations which they
transfer to the aligned electromagnetic fields. Due to the CP violation, the
Hubble-scale walls produce helical (non-zero Chern-Simons) magnetohydrodynamic
turbulence which then undergoes an inverse cascade, allowing the correlation
lengths to grow to 100 kpc today. We present an estimate the magnitude of the
generated electromagnetic fields in terms of the QCD parameters. We also

in the large tanb scenario. The resummed b->sgamma calculations are found to
reduce the renormalization scale uncertainty considerably. The low tanb
scenario is excluded by the present Higgs limits from LEP II. The constraint
from the Higgs limit in the $m_0,m_{1/2}$ plane is severe, if the trilinear

interaction. In the recent paper it is shown that the IL applied to the

produces new Toda-like systems of $N$ interacting particles endowed with

subdivided into symmetric domains. The mixture of the Toda and the

domain walls of this picture. Due to obvious symmetries this classification can
be generalized to the arbitrary number of particles. We also apply IL to

curve and discuss main features of its possible limits. The limits of Lax

construction of solutions of the Batalin-Vilkovisky classical master equation.
In particular, we study the case of sigma models on manifolds with boundary. We
show that a special case of this construction yields the Batalin-Vilkovisky
action functional of the Poisson sigma model on a disk. As we have shown in a
previous paper, the perturbative quantization of this model is related to
Kontsevich's deformation quantization of Poisson manifolds and to his formality
theorem. We also discuss the action of diffeomorphisms of the target manifolds.

corank $k$ if roughly speaking there exists a continuous map $g:X\to T$ such
that for each $t\in T$ the set $g^{-1}(t)$ has subexponential growth rate in
$X$ and the topological dimension $\dim T=k$ is minimal among all such maps.
Our main result is the inequality $\hyprank X\le\subcorank X$ for a large class
of metric spaces $X$ including all locally compact Hadamard spaces, where
$\hyprank X$ is maximal topological dimension of $\di Y$ among all $\CAT(-1)$
spaces $Y$ quasi-isometrically embedded into $X$ (the notion introduced by M.
Gromov in a slightly stronger form). This proves several properties of
$\hyprank$ conjectured by M. Gromov, in particular, that any Riemannian
symmetric space $X$ of noncompact type possesses no quasi-isometric embedding
$\hyp^n\to X$ of the standard hyperbolic space $\hyp^n$ with $n-1>\dim X-\rank
X$.

anisotropic exponents are organized in hierarchical families growing without

inertial-range dynamics corresponding to the dimensional scaling solution. The
increase with the P\'{e}clet number of hyperskewness and higher odd-dimensional
ratios signals the persistence of anisotropy effects also in the inertial
range.

optical potential cross section by simply repeating the calculation with
different values of $\hbar$, and observing which properties of the cross
section are invariant. This method is applied to the cross sections of a few
optical potentials used to describe the recent data of light heavy-ion elastic
scattering.

throughoutly a conventional ''non-strange'' dynamics based on such processes
which are allowed by the non-ideal $\omega-\phi$ mixing. We show that strong
interferences of the $t$ (meson exchange) and $s$ and $u$ (nucleon and nucleon
resonance) channels differ significantly in $\omega$ and $\phi$ production
amplitudes. This leads to a decrease of the relative yields in comparison with
expectations based on one-channel models with standard $\omega - \phi$ mixing.
We find a strong and non-trivial difference between observables in $\omega$ and
$\phi$ production reactions caused by the different role of the nucleon and
nucleon resonance amplitudes. A series of predictions for the experimental
study of this effect is presented.

convergence in the quasilinearization method of solving nonlinear ordinary
differential equations could be proved are formulated and elaborated. The
generalization of the proof to partial differential equations is straight
forward. The method, whose mathematical basis in physics was discussed recently
by one of the present authors (VBM), approximates the solution of a nonlinear
differential equation by treating the nonlinear terms as a perturbation about
the linear ones, and unlike perturbation theories is not based on the existence
of some kind of a small parameter.
  It is shown that the quasilinearization method gives excellent results when
applied to different nonlinear ordinary differential equations in physics, such
as the Blasius, Duffing, Lane-Emden and Thomas-Fermi equations. The first few
quasilinear iterations already provide extremely accurate and numerically
stable answers.
