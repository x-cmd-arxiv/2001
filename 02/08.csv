temperatures from 100 K to 10^5 K that originate from a 3-sigma fluctuation of
a CDM power spectrum in three different cosmologies. Our intention is to
determine the first objects that can cool to low temperatures, but not to
follow their dynamical evolution. We identify two generations of halos: those
with low virial temperatures, Tvir < 9000 K that remain largely neutral, and
those with larger virial temperatures that become ionized. The
lower-temperature, lower-mass halos are the first to cool to 75 percent of
their virial temperature. The precise temperature and mass of the first objects
are dependent upon the molecular hydrogen (H2) cooling function and the
cosmological model. The higher-mass halos collapse later but, in this paradigm,
cool much more efficiently once they have done so, first via electronic
transitions and then via molecular cooling: in fact, a greater residual
ionization once the halos cool below 9000 K results in an enhanced H2
production and hence a higher cooling rate at low temperatures than for the
lower-mass halos, so that within our constant-density model it is the former
that are the first to cool to really low temperatures. We discuss the possible
significance of this result in the context of CDM models in which the shallow
slope of the initial fluctuation spectrum on small scales leads to a wide range
of halo masses (of differing overdensities) collapsing over a small redshift
interval. This ``crosstalk'' is sufficiently important that both high- and
low-mass halos collapse during the lifetimes of the massive stars which may be
formed at these epochs. Further investigation is thus required to determine
which generation of halos plays the dominant role in early structure formation.

disk solutions is studied. It is found that the advection dominated branch, in
the presence of a wind, maintains the self-similar solution for the disk
structure with the temperature, $\theta \propto 1/r$, optical depth $\tau
\propto r^{P-1/2}$ and accretion rate $\dot m \propto r^P$. Based on global
solutions, cooling due to wind energy loss and advection are found to be
equally important. For a wide range of viscosity and wind parameters, the
temperature is about one-tenth of the virial value and $P \approx 0.9$,
independent of the mass accretion rate and radius. In the context of cooling by
unsaturated Comptonization of soft photons, solutions also exist where
radiative cooling, advection, and wind cooling are important. In this case,
wind regulated solutions are possible. Here, the radial dependence of the
critical mass accretion rate above which solutions do not exist is unchanged
from those solutions without winds. The wind/advection dominated solutions are
locally unstable to a new type of instability called ``wind driven insbility''
where the presence of a wind causes the disk to be unstable to long wavelength
perturbations of the surface density. The growth rate of this instability is
inversely proportional to the ratio of the radiative cooling to the
gravitational energy dissipation rates and it can grow on a timescale much
longer than the viscous timescale in the disk for sufficiently small radiative
cooling efficiencies.

stellar mass spectrum for masses $\ms \simgreat 0.5 \solm$. The model depends
solely on the competitive accretion that occurs in stellar clusters where each
star's accretion rate depends on the local gas density and the square of the
accretion radius. In a stellar cluster, there are two different regimes
depending on whether the gas or the stars dominate the gravitational potential.
When the cluster is dominated by cold gas, the accretion radius is given by a
tidal-lobe radius. This occurs as the cluster collapses towards a $\rho\propto
R^{-2}$ distribution. Accretion in this regime results in a mass spectrum with
an asymptotic limit of $\gamma=-3/2$ (where Salpeter is $\gamma=-2.35$). Once
the stars dominate the potential and are virialised, which occurs first in the
cluster core, the accretion radius is the Bondi-Hoyle radius. The resultant
mass spectrum has an asymptotic limit of $\gamma=-2$ with slightly steeper
slopes ($\gamma\approx-2.5$) if the stars are already mass-segr egated.
Simulations of accretion onto clusters containing 1000 stars show that as
expected, the low-mass stars accumulate the majority of their masses during the
gas dominated phase whereas the high-mass stars accumulate the majority of
their massed during the stellar dominated phase. This results in a mass
spectrum with a relatively shallow $\gamma\approx 3/2$ power-law for low-mass
stars and a steeper, power-law for high-mass stars $ -2.5\simless\gamma\le -2$.
This competitive accretion model also results in a mass segregated cluster.

within ~ 1E9 years. If Earth's orbit migrates outward, however, the biosphere
could remain intact over the entire main-sequence lifetime of the Sun. In this
paper, we explore the feasibility of engineering such a migration over a long
time period. The basic mechanism uses gravitational assists to (in effect)
transfer orbital energy from Jupiter to the Earth, and thereby enlarges the
orbital radius of Earth. This transfer is accomplished by a suitable
intermediate body, either a Kuiper Belt object or a main belt asteroid. The
object first encounters Earth during an inward pass on its initial highly
elliptical orbit of large (~ 300 AU) semimajor axis. The encounter transfers
energy from the object to the Earth in standard gravity-assist fashion by
passing close to the leading limb of the planet. The resulting outbound
trajectory of the object must cross the orbit of Jupiter; with proper timing,
the outbound object encounters Jupiter and picks up the energy it lost to
Earth. With small corrections to the trajectory, or additional planetary
encounters (e.g., with Saturn), the object can repeat this process over many
encounters. To maintain its present flux of solar energy, the Earth must
experience roughly one encounter every 6000 years (for an object mass of 1E22
g). We develop the details of this scheme and discuss its ramifications.

substantial gamma-ray contribution to the total luminosity of the object; in a
high state, the gamma-ray luminosity dominates over that at all other
frequencies by a factor of more than 10. There is no clear pattern of time
correlation; different bands do not always rise and fall together, even in the

  The spectra are modeled using a leptonic jet, with combined synchrotron
self-Compton + external Compton gamma-ray production. Spectral variability of

version of the Chiappini, Matteucci and Gratton (1997) model, assuming two main
accretion episodes for the formation of the Galaxy. The present model takes
into account in more detail than previously the halo density distribution and
explores the effects of a threshold density in the star formation process,
during both the halo and disk phases. In the comparison between model
predictions and available data, we have focused our attention on abundance
gradients as well as gas, stellar and star formation rate distributions along
the disk. We suggest that the mechanism for the formation of the halo leaves
detectable imprints on the chemical properties of the outer regions of the
disk, whereas the evolution of the halo and the inner disk are almost
completely disentangled. This is due to the fact that the halo and disk
densities are comparable at large Galactocentric distances and therefore the
gas lost from the halo can substantially contribute to building up the outer
disk. We also show that the existence of a threshold density for the star
formation rate, both in the halo and disk phase, is necessary to reproduce the

Moreover, we predict that the abundance gradients along the Galactic disk must
have increased with time and that the average [alpha/Fe] ratio in stars (halo
plus disk) slightly decrease going from 4 to 10 Kpcs from the Galactic center.
We also show that the same ratios increase substantially towards the outermost
disk regions and the expected scatter in the stellar ages decreases, because
the outermost regions are dominated by halo stars.

hydrogen-deficient post-AGB stars with carbon and oxygen abundances as observed

out in 1996, 1998 and 1999 with simultaneous B, V photometry. A multicomponent
spectrum is revealed with a veiled photospheric spectrum, broad emissions,
narrow emission lines of helium, and accretion, wind and shell features.
  Periodic modulations in many spectral features were found. The photospheric
absorption lines show sinusoidal variations in radial velocity with an
amplitude of +-6 km/s and a period of about 2.77 days. The radial velocities of
the narrow emission lines of He vary with the same period but in anti-phase to
the photospheric lines. The equivalent widths of the narrow emissions vary with
a phase-shift with respect to the velocity curve. The strength of the
red-shifted accretion components of Na D and other lines is also modulated with
the same period. The broad emission lines of metals vary mostly with the double
period of about 5.5 days.
  One unexpected result is that no correlation was found between the veiling
and the brightness, although both varied in wide ranges. This is partly due to
a contribution of the shell absorption to the photospheric line profiles, which
make them vary in width and depth thus simulating lower veiling.
  Most of the observed features can be interpreted in the framework of
non-axisymmetric magnetospheric accretion. We consider two possible models. In
the first the asymmetry is induced by orbital motion of an invisible, low mass
secondary, which also influences the gasflows around the star, the second
considers rotational modulation of a single star with an inclined or asymmetric
magnetosphere.

that this is a manifestation of the fundamental electron-hole asymmetry of
condensed matter described by the theory of hole superconductivity. The theory
asserts that electrons in nearly empty bands and holes in nearly full bands are
fundamentally different : the former yield high conductivity and normal metals,
the latter yield low normal state conductivity and high temperature
superconductivity. This is because the normal state transport of electrons is
coherent and that of holes is incoherent. We explain how this asymmetry arises
from the Coulomb interaction between electrons in atoms and the nature of
atomic orbitals, and propose a simple Hamiltonian to describe it. A $universal$
mechanism for superconductivity follows from this physics, whereby dressed hole
carriers undress by pairing, turning (partially) into electrons and becoming
more mobile in the superconducting state.

the Bernoulli (or Lorentz) force from spontaneous currents running along the
surfaces of the superconductor. The other contribution has a topological origin
and is related to the intrinsic angular momentum of Cooper pairs. The latter
can be described in terms of a Chern-Simons-like term in the low-energy field
theory of the superconductor and has some similarities with the quantum Hall
effect. The spontaneous Hall effect in a chiral superconductor is, however,
non-universal. Our analysis is based on three approaches to the problem: a
self-consistent solution of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, a generalized
Ginzburg-Landau theory, and a hydrodynamic formulation. All three methods
consistently lead to the same conclusion that the spontaneous Hall resistance
of a two-dimensional superconducting Hall bar is of order h/(e k_F\lambda)^2,
where k_F is the Fermi wave vector and \lambda is the London penetration depth;
the Hall resistance is substantially suppressed from a quantum unit of
resistance. Experimental issues in measuring this effect are briefly discussed.

transitions shows distinct peaks in parallel polarisation of the incident and
scattered light that are signature of collective higher order spin density
excitations. This is in striking contrast to the conventional selection rule
for non-resonant Raman scattering according to which spin modes can appear only
in perpendicular polarisation. We predict a new selection rule for the
excitations observed near resonance, namely that, apart from charge density
excitations, only spin modes with positive group velocities can appear as peaks
in the spectra in parallel configuration close to resonance. The results are
consistent with all of the presently available experimental data.

Umklapp terms and to a sudden deviation of the generalized momentum from a

Our schemes employ new properties of canonical orderings for planar graphs and

  For applications that need to determine in O(1) time the adjacency of two
nodes and the degree of a node, we use 2m+(5+1/k)n + o(m+n) bits for any
constant k > 0 while the best previous bound by Munro and Raman is 2m+8n +
o(m+n). If G is triconnected or triangulated, our bit count decreases to 2m+3n

(5/3)m+(5+1/k)n + o(n) for any constant k > 0. Thus, if a simple G is also
triconnected or triangulated, then 2m+2n + o(n) or 2m+n + o(n) bits suffice,

renormalization group (RG) corrections are folded with the DL Sudakov
contributions and must be included for a consistent subleading treatment to all

renormalization group improved high energy results. The corrections are valid
for arbitrary external lines and largest in the scalar Goldstone and Higgs

asymptotically free, with a dynamically generated mass scale. b) They have a

Argyres-Douglas-like CFTs, exhibit confinement, etc... c) The physics can, to a
large extent, be worked out in models with a large number of supersymmetries as
well as in purely bosonic ones. In the former case, exact BPS mass formulas can
be derived, brane constructions and embedding in M theory do exist. d) The
models have an interesting 1/N expansion, and it is possible to define a double
scaling limit in the sense of the ``old'' matrix models when approaching the
singularities in parameter space. These properties make these theories very
good toy models for four dimensional gauge theories with Higgs fields, and
provide a framework where the effects of breaking supersymmetry can be
explicitly studied. In our model, we work out in details the quantum space of
parameters. We obtain the non-local lagrangian description of the
Argyres-Douglas-like CFT, and show that it admits a strongly coupled fixed
point. We also explicitly demonstrate property d). The possibility of defining
such double scaling limits was not anticipated on the gauge theory side, and
could be of interest to understand the gauge theory/string theory

nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation is studied. The regular solitons exist due
to a balance between the nonlinear terms and (linear) third order dispersion;
they are not important at small $\alpha_3$ ($\alpha_3$ is the coefficient in
the third derivative term) and vanish at $\alpha_3 \to 0$. The most essential,
at small $\alpha_3$, is a quasisoliton emitting resonant radiation (resonantly
radiating soliton). Its relationship with the other (steady) quasisoliton,
called embedded soliton, is studied analytically and in numerical experiments.
It is demonstrated that the resonantly radiating solitons emerge in the course
of nonlinear evolution, which shows their physical significance.

We consider different physical phenomena (corresponding to performed

particular we find that the ``correction'' factor is a constant term for total
internal reflection and quarter-wave photonic bandgap, while it is
frequency-dependent in the case of undersized waveguide and distributed Bragg
reflector. The comparison of our predictions with the experimental results
shows quite a good agreement with observations and reveals the range of

Alice to Bob or from Bob to Alice. We characterize the general structure of
causal complete measurement superoperators, and exhibit examples that are
causal but not localizable. We construct another class of causal bipartite
superoperators that are not localizable by invoking bounds on the strength of
correlations among the parts of a quantum system. A bipartite superoperator is
said to be semilocalizable if it can be implemented with one-way quantum
communication from Alice to Bob, and it is semicausal if it conveys no
information from Bob to Alice. We show that all semicausal complete measurement
superoperators are semilocalizable, and we establish a general criterion for
semicausality. In the multipartite case, we observe that a measurement
superoperator that projects onto the eigenspaces of a stabilizer code is
localizable.
