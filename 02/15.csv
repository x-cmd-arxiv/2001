nuclear network includes all the important reactions of the p-p chain,

burning in massive stars. The main evolutionary features of these models are
discussed, also in comparison with models of non-zero metallicity. Among
several interesting aspects, particular attention has been paid to describe: i)
the first synthesis of 12C inside the stars, that may suddenly trigger the
CNO-cycle causing particular evolutionary features; ii) the pollution of the
stellar surface by the dredge-up events, that are effective only within
particular mass ranges; iii) the mass limits which conventionally define the
classes of low-, intermediate-, and high-mass stars on the basis of common

microlensing events can reveal the presence of planets orbiting the microlensed
source stars. With the potential of probing planets in the Galactic Bulge and
Magellanic Clouds, such detections greatly increase the volume over which
planets can be found. This paper expands on these original studies by
considering the effect of planetary phase on the form of the resultant
microlensing light curve. It is found that crescent-like sources can undergo
substantially more magnification than a uniformly illuminated disk, the model
typically employed in studying such planets. In fact, such a circularly
symmetric model is found to suffer a minimal degree of magnification when
compared to the crescent models. The degree of magnification is also a strong
function of the planet's orientation with respect to the microlensing caustic.
The form of the magnification variability is also strongly dependent on the
planetary phase and from which direction it is swept by the caustic, providing
further clues to the geometry of the planetary system. As the amount of light
reflected from a planet also depends on its phase, the detection of extreme
crescent-like planets requires the advent of 30-m class telescopes, while light
curves of planets at more moderate phases can be determined with today's 10-m
telescopes.

the evolved density perturbations are mainly determined by the initial
perturbations localized in the same spatial range. Furthermore, we show that
the evolved mode is monotonically related to the initial perturbed mode. Thus
large (small) perturbed modes statistically correspond to the large (small)
initial perturbed modes. We test this prediction by using QSO Ly$\alpha$
absorption samples. The results show that the weakly non-linear features for
both the transmitted flux and identified forest lines are quasi-localized. The
locality and monotonic properties provide a solid basis for a DWT
scale-by-scale Gaussianization reconstruction algorithm proposed by Feng & Fang
(Feng & Fang, 2000) for data in the weakly non-linear regime. With the
Zel'dovich solution, we find also that the major non-Gaussianity caused by the
weakly non-linear evolution is local scale-scale correlations. Therefore, to
have a precise recovery of the initial Gaussian mass field, it is essential to
remove the scale-scale correlations.

effect of the Galactic tidal field. We find that clusters within 150 pc of the
Galactic center dissolve within ~55 Myr, but their projected densities drop
below the background density in the direction of the Galactic center within
only a few Myr, effectively making these clusters undetectable after that time.
Detailed observations of the Arches cluster, taken at face value, suggest that
its mass function is unusually flat and that the cluster contains an
overabundance of stars more massive than 20 Msun. Our dynamical analysis,
however, shows that the observed characteristics of the Arches cluster are
consistent with a perfectly normal initial mass function. The observed
anomalies are then caused by a combination of observational selection effects

  Journal",,"10.1086/321339",,"astro-ph",,"  We present calculations of r-process nucleosynthesis in neutrino-driven winds
from the nascent neutron stars of core-collapse supernovae. A full dynamical
reaction network for both the alpha-rich freezeout and the subsequent r-process
is employed. The physical properties of the neutrino-heated ejecta are deduced
from a general relativistic model in which spherical symmetry and steady flow
are assumed. Our results suggest that proto-neutron stars with a large
compaction ratio provide the most robust physical conditions for the r-process.
The third peak of the r-process is well reproduced in the winds from these
``compact'' proto-neutron stars even for a moderate entropy, \sim 100-200 N_A
k, and a neutrino luminosity as high as \sim 10^{52} ergs s^{-1}. This is due
to the short dynamical timescale of material in the wind. As a result, the
overproduction of nuclei with A \lesssim 120 is diminished (although some
overproduction of nuclei with A \approx 90 is still evident). The abundances of
the r-process elements per event is significantly higher than in previous
studies. The total-integrated nucleosynthesis yields are in good agreement with
the solar r-process abundance pattern. Our results have confirmed that the
neutrino-driven wind scenario is still a promising site in which to form the
solar r-process abundances. However, our best results seem to imply both a
rather soft neutron-star equation of state and a massive proto-neutron star
which is difficult to achieve with standard core-collapse models. We propose
that the most favorable conditions perhaps require that a massive supernova
progenitor forms a massive proto-neutron star by accretion after a failed
initial neutrino burst.

Hence, the importance of the LMC RCB stars. We find a much larger range of

galaxies, their stellar populations have inferred masses of ~10^11 solar masses
and ages of ~7x10^8 years. Both galaxies have color gradients: their centers
are significantly bluer than their outer regions. The surface brightness of
both galaxies is roughly an order of magnitude greater than would be predicted

underestimated, possibly as a consequence of undetected systematic effects.
Discarding the most discrepant 5% of the measurements alleviates but does not
completely resolve this problem. The median-statistics power spectrum of this

should be applicable to the more general cases to the extent that the relative
sizes of stellar components are preserved with metallicity changes.
  The calculated metallicity-age dependent Period-Color Relations substantially
agree with Rucinski & Duerbeck's (1997) empirically derived corrections to the
Period-Color Relation over most of the investigated range of periods. However,
our predictions deviate to a greater degree as stellar age increases since
their parameterization does not include the effect of evolution.

advantage of long space-VLBI baselines and large arrays of ground antennas,
such as the Very Long Baseline Array and European VLBI Network, to obtain high
resolution images of 27 active galactic nuclei, and to measure the core
brightness temperatures of these sources more accurately than is possible from
the ground. A detailed analysis of the source properties is given in
accompanying papers. We have also performed an extensive series of simulations
to investigate the errors in VSOP images caused by the relatively large holes
in the (u,v) plane when sources are observed near the orbit normal direction.
We find that while the nominal dynamic range (defined as the ratio of map peak
to off-source error) often exceeds 1000:1, the true dynamic range (map peak to
on-source error) is only about 30:1 for relatively complex core-jet sources.
For sources dominated by a strong point source, this value rises to
approximately 100:1. We find the true dynamic range to be a relatively weak
function of the difference in position angle (PA) between the jet PA and (u,v)
coverage major axis PA. For low signal-to-noise regions typically located down
the jet away from the core, large errors can occur, causing spurious features
in VSOP images that should be interpreted with caution.

radio-loud active galactic nuclei, based on data from the VLBI Space Observing
Programme (Paper I) and previously published studies. Our sample is drawn from
the well-studied Pearson-Readhead (PR) survey, and is ideally suited for
investigating the general effects of relativistic beaming in compact radio
sources. In addition to confirming many previously known correlations, we have
discovered several new trends that lend additional support to the beaming
model. These trends suggest that the most highly beamed sources in
core-selected samples tend to have a) high optical polarizations; b) large
pc/kpc-scale jet misalignments; c) prominent VLBI core components; d)
one-sided, core, or halo radio morphology on kiloparsec scales; e) narrow
emission line equivalent widths; and f) a strong tendency for intraday
variability at radio wavelengths. We have used higher resolution space and
ground-based VLBI maps to confirm the bi-modality of the jet misalignment
distribution for the PR survey, and find that the sources with aligned parsec-
and kiloparsec-scale jets generally have arcsecond-scale radio emission on both
sides of the core. The aligned sources also have broader emission line widths.
We find evidence that the BL Lacertae objects in the PR survey are all highly
beamed, and have very similar properties to the high-optically polarized
quasars, with the exception of smaller redshifts. A cluster analysis on our
data shows that after partialing out the effects of redshift, the luminosities
of our sample objects in various wave bands are generally well-correlated with
each other, but not with other source properties.

the bulk electron spectrum is a well known physical phenomenon. At
superconductor surfaces, quasiparticles with energies inside the
superconducting gap $\Delta$ may be trapped in bound states in quantum wells,
formed by total reflection against the vacuum and total Andreev reflection
against the superconductor. Since an electron reflects as a hole and sends a
Cooper pair into the superconductor, the surface states give rise to resonant
transport of quasiparticle and Cooper pair currents, and may be observed in
tunneling spectra. In superconducting junctions, these surface states may
hybridize and form bound Andreev states, trapped between the superconducting
electrodes. In d-wave superconductors, the order parameter changes sign under
$90^o$ rotation and, as a consequence, Andreev reflection may lead to the
formation of zero energy quasiparticle bound states, midgap states (MGS). The
formation of MGS is a robust feature of d-wave superconductivity and provides a
unified framework for many important effects which will be reviewed: large
Josephson current, low-temperature anomaly of the critical Josephson current,
$\pi$-junction behavior, $0\to \pi$ junction crossover with temperature,
zero-bias conductance peaks, paramagnetic currents, time reversal symmetry
breaking, spontaneous interface currents, and resonance features in subgap
currents. Taken together these effects, when observed in experiments, provide
proof for d-wave superconductivity in the cuprates.

coannihilation corridors with high \tan\beta are highly sensitive to A_0, and
large A_0 allows m_0 to become as large as 1TeV. Nonuniversal soft breaking
models at high \tan\beta also allow the opening of a new annihilation channel

classical (odd) transformation properties of the pure CS action. This effect,

explore the physical consequences of this anomaly. We also show that
generalized, nonlocal parity transformations can be defined in such a way that
the regularized theory is odd, and that those transformations tend to the usual

the important problem of quantum physics. However, in relativistic quantum
field theory (RQFT) its complete and exact solution is possible for a few
simple models only. Unitary transformations (UT's) considered in this survey do
not diagonalize H, but convert H into a form which enables us to find
approximately some H eigenstates. During the last years there have appeared
many papers devoted to physical applications of such UT's. Our aim is to
present a systematic and self-sufficient exposition of the UT method. The two
general kinds of UT's are pointed out, distinct variations of each kind being
possible. We consider in detail the problem of finding the simplest H
eigenstates for interacting mesons and nucleons using the so-called
``clothing'' UT and Okubo's UT. These UT's allow us to suggest definite
approaches to the problem of two-particle (deuteron-like) bound states in RQFT.
The approaches are shown to yield the same two-nucleon quasipotentials in the
first nonvanishing approximation. We demonstrate how the particle mass
renormalization can be fulfilled in the framework of the ``clothing''
procedure. Besides the UT of the Hamiltonian we discuss the accompanying UT of
the Lorentz boost generators.

It has long been known that the genetic code is very efficient in limiting the
effect of point mutation. A misread codon will commonly code either for the
same amino acid or for a similar one in terms of its biochemical properties, so
the structure and function of the coded protein remain relatively unaltered.
Previous studies have attempted to address this question more quantitatively,
namely by statistically estimating the fraction of randomly generated codes
that do better than the genetic code regarding its overall robustness. In this
paper, we extend these results by investigating the role of amino acid
frequencies in the optimality of the genetic code. When measuring the relative
fitness of the natural code with respect to a random code, it is indeed natural
to assume that a translation error affecting a frequent amino acid is less
favorable than that of a rare one, at equal mutation cost. We find that taking
the amino acid frequency into account accordingly decreases the fraction of
random codes that beat the natural code, making the latter comparatively even
more robust. This effect is particularly pronounced when more refined measures
of the amino acid substitution cost are used than hydrophobicity. To show this,
we devise a new cost function by evaluating with computer experiments the
change in folding free energy caused by all possible single-site mutations in a
set of known protein structures. With this cost function, we estimate that of
the order of one random code out of 100 millions is more fit than the natural
code when taking amino acid frequencies into account. The genetic code seems
therefore structured so as to minimize the consequences of translation errors
on the 3D structure and stability of proteins.
