wire systems by solving the dynamically screened Bethe-Salpeter equation using
realistic Coulomb interaction between carriers. Including dynamical screening
effects in the electron/hole self-energy and in the electron-hole interaction
vertex function, we find that the excitonic absorption is essentially peaked at
a constant energy for a large range of photoexcitation density ($n= 0-6\times
10^5$ cm$^{-1}$), above which the absorption peak disappears without
appreciable gain i.e., \textit{no} exciton to free electron-hole plasma Mott
transition is observed, in contrast to previous theoretical results but in
agreement with recent experimental findings. This absence of gain (or the
non-existence of a Mott transition) arises from the strong inelastic scattering
by one-dimensional plasmons or charge density excitations, closely related to
the non-Fermi liquid nature of one-dimensional systems. Our theoretical work
demonstrates a transition or a crossover in one-dimensional photoexcited
electron-hole system from an effective Fermi liquid behavior associated with a
dilute gas of noninteracting excitons in the low density region ($n<10^5$
cm$^{-1}$) to a non-Fermi liquid in the high density region ($n>10^5$

inhomogeneous, providing evidence for phase separation into a two component
