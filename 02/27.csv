Way and of nearby discs (at redshift z~0). In this paper, we compare the
predictions of our ``hybrid'' approach to galaxy evolution to observations at
moderate and high redshift. We find that the models are in fairly good
agreement with observations up to z~1, while some problems appear at higher
redshift (provided there is no selection bias in the data); these discrepancies
may suggest that galaxy mergers (not considered in this work) played a non
negligible role at z>1. We also predict the existence of a ``universal''
correlation between abundance gradients and disc scalelengths, independent of

$\sim15-$30 Myr, similar to the range in ages of stars derived for the entire

H$\alpha$ imaging of the \ion{H}{2} region DEM 228, we find that DEM 228

that DEM 228 and LH 72 are offset by $\sim1-2\arcmin$ from the peak 21-cm

that SGS-14 has cleared its interior of gas and triggered the formation of LH

a stellar arc similar to others seen within LMC-4.

explain the variability characteristics in 56-77% of the stars, while the

  Consequences for the Extragalactic Distance Scale","23 pages,16 Postscript figures, uses harvard mn latex style file",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Using published HST Cepheid data from 25 galaxies, we have found a
correlation between the P-L dispersion and host galaxy metallicity which is
significant at the ~3sigma level in the V band. This result supports the
suggestion that the metallicity dependence of the Cepheid P-L relation may be
stronger than expected. The high observed dispersions in the HST Cepheid P-L
relations have the further consequence that the bias due to incompleteness in
the P-L relation at faint magnitudes is more significant than previously
thought. In the HST sample, galaxies at higher distance tend to have higher
metallicity. This means that when a full metallicity/incompleteness correction
is made, a scale error in the published Cepheid distances is seen in the sense
that the published distance moduli are increasingly underestimates at larger
distances. This results in the average distance modulus to the four galaxies in
the Virgo cluster core increasing from (m-M)_0=31.2+-0.19 to (m-M)_0=31.8+-0.17
with similar increases for the Fornax and Ursa Major clusters. For the 18 HST
galaxies with good Tully-Fisher distances and (m-M)_0>29.5 the Cepheid-TF
distance modulus average residual increases from 0.44+-0.09 mag to 0.82+-0.1mag
indicating a significant scale error in TF distances and resulting in the
previous Pierce & Tully TF estimate of H_0=85 reducing to H_0=58+-7. Finally,
for the 8 HST galaxies with SNIa, the metallicity corrected Cepheid distances
now imply a metallicity dependence of SNIa peak luminosity in the sense that
metal-poor hosts have lower luminosity SNIa. Thus SNIa Hubble diagram estimates
of both H_0 and q_0 may also require significant metallicity corrections.

the relative inclination of the two orbits is very small. Our individual masses
and spectroscopic light ratios for the three M stars in the Gliese 644 system
provide three points for the mass-luminosity relation near the bottom of the

agree well with theoretical models for solar metallicity and an age of 5 Gyr.

  From observations of 19 objects with the Keck and VLT telescopes, we reach
the following main conclusions. Contrary to expectations, the star formation
rates deduced from the Hbeta luminosity are on average no larger than those
implied by the stellar continuum at 1500 A; presumably any differential
extinction between rest-frame optical and UV is small compared with the
relative uncertainties in the calibrations of these two star formation tracers.
For the galaxies in our sample, the abundance of O can only be determined to
within one order of magnitude. Even so, it seems well established that LBGs are
the most metal-enriched structures at z = 3, apart from QSOs, with abundances
greater than about 1/10 solar. They are also significantly overluminous for
their metallicities; this is probably an indication that their mass-to-light
ratios are small compared with present-day galaxies. At face value their
velocity dispersions, sigma = 50 - 115 km/s imply virial masses of about
10^{10} solar masses within half-light radii of 2.5 kpc. However, we are unable
to establish if the widths of the emission lines do reflect the motions of the
H II regions within the gravitational potential of the galaxies, even though in
two cases we see hints of rotation curves. All 19 LBGs observed show evidence
for galactic-scale superwinds; such outflows are important for regulating star
formation, distributing metals over large volumes, and allowing Lyman continuum
photons to escape and ionize the IGM.

  in ApJ",,"10.1086/321476",,"astro-ph",,"  The hierarchical clustering model of the cosmic mass field is examined in the
context of intermittency. We show that the mass field satisfying the
correlation hierarchy $\xi_n\simeq Q_n(\xi_2)^{n-1}$ is intermittent if $\kappa
< d$, where $d$ is the dimension of the field, and $\kappa$ is the power-law
index of the non-linear power spectrum in the discrete wavelet transform (DWT)
representation. We also find that a field with singular clustering can be
described by hierarchical clustering models with scale-dependent coefficients
$Q_n$ and that this scale-dependence is completely determined by the
intermittent exponent and $\kappa$. Moreover, the singular exponents of a field
can be calculated by the asymptotic behavior of $Q_n$ when $n$ is large.
Applying this result to the transmitted flux of HS1700 Ly$\alpha$ forests, we
find that the underlying mass field of the Ly$\alpha$ forests is significantly
intermittent. On physical scales less than about 2.0 h$^{-1}$ Mpc, the observed
intermittent behavior is qualitatively different from the prediction of the
hierarchical clustering with constant $Q_n$. The observations, however, do show
the existence of an asymptotic value for the singular exponents. Therefore, the
mass field can be described by the hierarchical clustering model with
scale-dependent $Q_n$. The singular exponent indicates that the cosmic mass
field at redshift $\sim 2$ is weakly singular at least on physical scales as
small as 10 h$^{-1}$ kpc.

conical geometry. However, more and more observations on relativistic jets in
radio galaxies, active galactic nuclei, and ""microquasars"" in the Galaxy have
shown that many of these outflows are not conical, but cylindrical, i.e., they
maintain constant cross sections at large scales. Thus it is necessary to
discuss the possibility that GRBs may be due to highly collimated cylindrical
jets, not conical ones. Here we study the dynamical evolution of cylindrical
jets and discuss their afterglows. Both analytical and numerical results are
presented. It is shown that when the lateral expansion is not taken into
account, a cylindrical jet typically remains to be highly relativistic for \sim
10^8 - 10^9 s. During this relativistic phase, the optical afterglow decays as
\propto t^{-p/2} at first, where p is the index characterizing the power-law
energy distribution of electrons. Then the light curve steepens to be \propto
t^{-(p+1)/2} due to cooling of electrons. After entering the non-relativistic
phase (i.e., t > 10^{11} s), the afterglow is \propto t^{-(5p-4)/6}. But if the
cylindrical jet expands laterally at co-moving sound speed, then the decay
becomes \propto t^{-p} and \propto t^{-(15p-21)/10} - t^{-(15p-20)/10} in the
ultra-relativistic and non-relativistic phase respectively. Note that in both
cases, the light curve turns flatter after the relativistic-Newtonian
transition point, which differs markedly from the behaviour of a conical jet.
It is suggested that some GRBs with afterglows decaying as t^{-1.1} - t^{-1.3}
may be due to cylindrical jets, not necessarily isotropic fireballs.

in the framework of a unifying scheme relating the formation of QSOs and
spheroids (Granato et al. 2000). The theoretical angular correlation function
is derived for different bias functions, corresponding to different values of
the ratio $M_{\rm halo}/M_{\rm sph}$ between the mass of the dark halo and the
final mass in stars. SCUBA sources are predicted to be strongly clustered, with
a clustering strength increasing with mass. We show that the model accounts for
the clustering of Lyman-break Galaxies, seen as the optical counterpart of low-
to intermediate-mass primeval spheroidal galaxies and is also consistent with
the observed angular correlation function of Extremely Red Objects. Best
agreement is obtained for $M_{\rm halo}/M_{\rm sph}=100$. We also consider the
implications for small scale fluctuations observed at sub-mm wavelengths by
current or forthcoming experiments aimed at mapping the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB). The predicted amplitude of the clustering signal in the 350
GHz channel of the Planck mission strongly depends on the halo-to-bulge mass
ratio and may be of comparable amplitude to primary CMB anisotropies for
multipole numbers $l\simgt 50$.

Observations with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) aboard the

extended and is bipolar in morphology. The ACIS spectrum displays strong
emission from highly ionized Ne and weaker emission features which we attribute
to O, Mg, and Si. Model fits to this spectrum suggest a characteristic
temperature T_x ~ 3x10^6 K and an intrinsic (unabsorbed) X-ray luminosity of
L_x ~ 1.3x10^32 ergs/s. The intranebular absorption of X-ray emission is highly
nonuniform, but the modeling indicates an average column density N_H ~ 6x10^21
cm^-2, consistent with previous measurements of relatively large visual
extinction within the nebula. We suggest that the X-ray emission from NGC 7027
is or was generated by a hitherto undetected fast wind from the central star of
NGC 7027, or from a companion to this star. Chandra's detection of extended,
high-temperature X-ray emission from BD +30 3639, NGC 6543, and now NGC 7027

extra-dimensional components of the gauge fields, which after compactification
on a certain topologically non-trivial background become tachyonic and
condense. If the tachyonic mass is a tree level effect, the natural scale of
the gauge symmetry breaking is set by the inverse radius of the internal space,
which, in case of the electroweak symmetry, must be around $\sim 1/$TeV. We
discuss the possibility of a vanishing tree level mass for the Higgs. In such a
scenario the tachyonic mass can be induced by quantum loops and can be
naturally smaller than the compactification scale. We give an example in which
this possibility can be realized. Starting from an Einstein--Yang--Mills theory
coupled to fermions in 10-dimensions, we are able to reproduce the spectrum of
the Standard Model like chiral fermions and Higgs type scalars in 4-dimensions
upon compactifying on ${\mathbb{C}}P^1\times {\mathbb{C}}P^2$. The existence of
a monopole solution on ${\mathbb{C}}P^1$ and a self dual U(1) instanton on

tachyonic or massless scalars in 4-dimensions. We give a simple rule which

left-handed sleptons get the LFV masses via the neutrino Yukawa interaction in
this model, the event rate of mu->e gamma and the SUSY-SM correction to
(g_mu-2)/2 (\delta a_mu^{SUSY}) are strongly correlated. When the left-handed
sleptons have a LFV mass between the first and second generations
((m^2_L)_{12}) in the mass matrix, it should be suppressed by \sim 10^{-3}
({10^-9}/\delta a_mu^{SUSY}) compared with the diagonal components
(m_{SUSY}^2), from the current experimental bound on mu-> e gamma. The recent
(g_mu-2) result indicates {\delta a_mu^{SUSY}}\sim 10^{-9}. The future charged
LFV experiments could cover (m^2_L)_{12}/m_{SUSY}^2\gsim 10^{-(5-6)}. These
experiments will give a significant impact on the flavour models and the
SUSY-breaking models. In the SUSY see-saw model (m^2_L)_{12} is proportional to
square of the tau-neutrino Yukawa-coupling constant. In the typical models
where the neutrino-oscillation results are explained and the top-quark and
tau-neutrino Yukawa couplings are unified at the GUT scale, a large LFV mass of
(m^2_L)_{12}/m_{SUSY}^2\gsim 10^{-4} is generated, and the large LFV event

the gravitino, the axino mass is generically not of the order of the
supersymmetry breaking scale and can be much smaller. The axino is therefore an
intriguing candidate for a stable superpartner. The axinos are a natural
candidate for cold dark matter in the Universe when they are generated
non-thermally through out-of-equilibrium neutralino decays or via a competing
thermal production mechanism through scatterings and decays of particles in the
plasma. We identify axino masses in the range of tens of MeV to several GeV
(depending on the scenario) as corresponding to cold axino relics if the
reheating temperature T_R is less than about 5 \times 10^4 GeV. At higher T_R
and lower mass, axinos could constitute warm dark matter. In the scenario with
axinos as stable relics the gravitino problem finds a natural solution. The
lightest superpartner of the Standard Model spectrum will remain stable in
high-energy detectors but may be either neutral or charged. The usual
constraint Omega*h^2<1 on the relic abundance of the lightest neutralino does
not hold.

order, the parallel- perpendicular asymmetry in azimuthal distributions of both

energy. Using the soft gluon resummation formalism, we have calculated the
next-to-leading order corrections to the asymmetry to next-to-leading
logarithmic accuracy. It is shown that radiative corrections practically do not
affect the Born predictions for the azimuthal asymmetry at energies of the
fixed target experiments. Both leading and next-to-leading order predictions
for the asymmetry are insensitive to within few percent to theoretical
uncertainties in the QCD input parameters: $m_{Q}$, $\mu_{R}$, $\mu_{F}$,
$\Lambda_{QCD}$ and in the gluon distribution function. Our analysis shows that
nonperturbative corrections to a $B$-meson azimuthal asymmetry due to the gluon
transverse motion in the target are negligible. We conclude that measurements
of the single spin asymmetry would provide a good test of pQCD applicability to
heavy flavor production at fixed target energies.

matter. In particular we calculate correlation energies and correlation times.
Approximating the Green's functions in the KB collision kernel by the free
Green's functions the Levinson equation is obtained. This approximation is
valid for weak interactions and/or low densities. It relates to the extended
quasi-classical approximation for the spectral function. Comparing the
Levinson, Born and KB calculations allows for an estimate of higher order
spectral corrections to the correlations. A decrease in binding energy is
reported due to spectral correlations and off-shell parts in the reduced
density matrix.

mechanics for the lowest energy states of a system made of two scalar particles
interacting via the exchange of a massless boson. They are compared to the
exact results obtained by using solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation which
are well known in this case (Wick-Cutkosky model). Deficiencies of the
point-form approach together with the single-particle current are emphasised.
They point to the contribution of two-body currents which are required in any
case to fulfil current conservation.

  3D without runaways","(updated journal reference & email address)","J. Phys. A. vol. 34 pp. 3421-3428 (2001)","10.1088/0305-4470/34/16/310",,"physics.gen-ph",,"  It is well known that the third-order Lorentz-Dirac equation admits runaway
solutions wherein the energy of the particle grows without limit, even when
there is no external force. These solutions can be denied simply on physical
grounds, and on the basis of careful analysis of the correspondence between
classical and quantum theory. Nonetheless, one would prefer an equation that
did not admit unphysical behavior at the outset. Such an equation - an
integro-differential version of the Lorentz-Dirac equation - is currently
available either in 1 dimension only, or in 3 dimensions only in the
non-relativistic limit.
  It is shown herein how the Lorentz-Dirac equation may be integrated without
approximation, and is thereby converted to a second-order integro-differential
equation in 3D satisfying the above requirement. I.E., as a result, no
additional constraints on the solutions are required because runaway solutions
are intrinsically absent. The derivation is placed within the historical
context established by standard works on classical electrodynamics by Rohrlich,
and by Jackson.

the point of view of decision theory. He proved that up to a constant factor
the Fisher information is the only metric which is monotone under stochastic
transformations. The present paper deals with monotone metrics on the space of
finite density matrices on the basis motivated by quantum mechanics. A
characterization of those metrics is given in terms of operator monotone
functions. Several concrete metrics are constructed and analyzed, in
particular, instead of the uniqueness in the probabilistic case, there is a
large class of monotone metrics. Some of those appeared already in the physics
literature a long time ago. A limiting procedure to pure states is discussed as
well.

"quant-ph/0102135",,"C.R. Hagen","Cutoff dependence and Lorentz invariance of the Casimir effect","5 pgs, revtex, no figures",,,,"quant-ph hep-th",,"  The Casimir force between two conducting planes is considered in both the
electromagnetic and scalar field cases. This is done by the usual summation
over energy eigenmodes of the system as well as by a calculation of the stress
tensor in the region between the planes. The latter case requires that careful
attention be given to singular operator products, an issue which is
accommodated here by invoking the point separation method in conjunction with a
scalar cutoff. This is shown to yield cutoff dependent and divergent
contributions to the Casimir pressure which are dependent on the separation
parameters, but entirely consistent with Lorentz covariance. Averaging over the
point splitting parameters allows finite results to be obtained, but fails to
yield a unique Casimir force.
