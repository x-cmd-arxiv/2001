stage when the secondary, having overfilled its Roche lobe inside the common
envelope, starts to transfer mass to the core of the primary at a very high
mass-transfer rate and the subsequent nucleo-synthesis in the core-impact
region. Using a parametrized model for the structure of the envelope at this
stage, we perform 2-dimensional hydrodynamical calculations with the Munich
Prometheus code to calculate the dynamics of the stream emanating from the
secondary and its impact on the core of the primary. We find that, for the
lower end of the estimated mass-transfer rate, low-entropy, hydrogen-rich
material can penetrate deep into the primary core where nucleosynthesis through
the hot CNO cycle can take place and that the associated neutron exposure may
be sufficiently high for significant s-processing. For mass-transfer rates at
the high end of our estimated range and higher densities in the stream, the
stream impact can lead to the dredge-up of helium, but the neutron production
is too low for significant s-processing.

orbits over the constant energy surface, i.e., the asymptotic evolution towards
a microcanonical distribution. We then focus on the necessary conditions for
the equivalence of statistical ensembles and remark that this equivalence is
broken for any N-body system whose interaction has a range comparable with its
spatial extension. Once realized that the obstacles originate from the long
range nature of the Newtonian interaction, leading to the non-extensivity of
canonical and grand-canonical thermodynamic potentials, we show that instead a
suitably generalized microcanonical ensemble constitutes an orthode, i.e., a
reliable framework for a correct Thermodynamics. Within this setting we use the
thermodynamic relations and find consistent definitions for Entropy (which
turns out to be extensive, despite the non stable nature of the interaction),
Temperature and Heat Capacity. Then, a Second Law-like criterion is used to
select the hierarchy of secular equilibria describing, for any finite time, the

equations of radiation hydrodynamics to order unity in v/c, in the flux-limited
diffusion (FLD) approximation. In this approximation, the tensor Eddington
factor f which closes the radiation moment equations is chosen to be an
empirical function of radiation energy density. This is easier to implement and
faster than full-transport techniques, in which f is computed by solving the
transfer equation. However, FLD is less accurate when the flux has a component
perpendicular to the gradient in radiation energy density, and in optically
thin regions when the radiation field depends strongly on angle. The material
component of the fluid is here assumed to be in local thermodynamic
equilibrium. The energy equations are operator-split, with transport terms,
radiation diffusion term, and other source terms evolved separately. Transport
terms are applied using the same consistent transport algorithm as in ZEUS-2D.
The radiation diffusion term is updated using an alternating-direction implicit
method with convergence checking. Remaining source terms are advanced together
implicitly using numerical root-finding. However when absorption opacity is
zero, accuracy is improved by treating compression and expansion source terms
using time-centered differencing. Results are discussed for test problems
including radiation-damped linear waves, radiation fronts propagating in
optically-thin media, subcritical and supercritical radiating shocks, and an
optically-thick shock in which radiation dominates downstream pressure.

reliable abundances and abundance limits (the HI data are described in Paper
II). Distances to stellar probes are revisited and calculated consistently, in
order to derive distance brackets or limits for many of the clouds, taking care
to properly interpret non-detections. The main conclusions are the following.
1) Absolute abundances have been measured using lines of SII, NI and OI, with
the following resulting values: ~0.1 solar for one HVC (complex C), ~0.3 solar
for the Magellanic Stream, ~0.5 solar for a southern IVC, and ~ solar for two
northern IVCs (the IV Arch and LLIV Arch). Finally, approximate values in the
range 0.5-2 solar are found for three more IVCs. 2) Depletion patterns in IVCs
are like those in warm disk or halo gas. 3) Most distance limits are based on
strong UV lines of CII, SiII and MgII, a few on CaII. Distance limits for major
HVCs are >5 kpc, while distance brackets for several IVCs are in the range
0.5-2 kpc. 4) Mass limits for major IVCs are 0.5-8x10^5 M_sun, but for major
HVCs they are >10^6 M_sun. 5) The CaII/HI ratio varies by up to a factor 2-5
within a single cloud, somewhat more between clouds. 6) The NaIHI ratio varies
by a factor >10 within a cloud, and even more between clouds. Thus, CaII can be
useful for determining both lower and upper distance limits, but NaI only
yields upper limits.

the ratio N(HI-9 arcmin)/N(HI-35 arcmin) lies in the range 0.2-2.5. For
low-velocity gas this ratio ranges from 0.75 to 1.3 (the observed ratio is
0.85-1.4, but it appears that the correction for stray radiation is slightly
off). The smaller range for the low-velocity gas may be caused by confusion in
the line of sight, so that a low ratio in one component can be compensated by a
high ratio in another -- for 11 low-velocity clouds fit by one component the
distribution of ratios has a larger dispersion. Comparison with higher angular
resolution data is possible for sixteen sightlines. Eight sightlines with HI
data at 1 arcmin-2 arcmin resolution show a range of 0.75-1.25 for N(HI-2

spacecraft Ulysses and Galileo have recorded a substantial flux of large
interstellar grains with radii between 0.25 and 2.0 mu entering the solar
system from the local interstellar cloud. The most commonly used interstellar
grain size distribution is characterized by a a^-3.5 power law in grain radii
a, and extends to a maximum grain radius of 0.25 mu. The extension of the
interstellar grain size distribution to such large radii will have a major
effect on the median grain size, and on the amount of mass needed to be tied up
in dust for a given visual optical depth. It is therefore important to
investigate whether this population of larger dust particles prevails in the
general interstellar medium, or if it is merely a local phenomenon. The
presence of large interstellar grains can be mainly inferred from their effect
on the intensity and radial profiles of scattering halos around X-ray sources.
In this paper we examine the grain size distribution that gives rise to the
X-ray halo around Nova Cygni 1992. The results of our study confirm the need to
extend the interstellar grain size distribution in the direction of this source
to and possibly beyond 2.0 mu. The model that gives the best fit to the halo
data is characterized by: (1) a grain size distribution that follows an a^-3.5
power law up to 0.50 mu, followed by an a^-4.0 extension from 0.50 mu to 2.0
mu; and (2) silicate and graphite (carbon) dust-to-gas mass ratios of 0.0044
and 0.0022, respectively, consistent with solar abundances constraints.
Additional observations of X-ray halos probing other spatial directions are
badly needed to test the general validity of this result.

lower part of the so-called normal branch. We found broad peaked noise with a
centroid frequency and width of ~4-7 Hz and ~6-12 Hz respectively. The peaked
noise was strongest in the lower flaring branch, with a maximum fractional rms
amplitude of ~3 %. We conclude that it is not a manifestation of atoll source
high frequency noise, as had been suggested, and compare it with the power
spectral features seen in other Z sources. We find that the peaked noise is

Our approach, based on a parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) expansion, shows
that VEP effects give rise to highly directional contributions to the neutrino
oscillation length. These terms induce anisotropies in the linear and angular
momentum of the emitted neutrinos, which can account for both the observed
translational and rotational pulsar motions. The violation needed to produce
the actual motions is completely compatible with the existing bounds.

diagonal and off-diagonal modes, which are very flexible to deal with
configuration-related problems in the power spectrum detection. With simulation
samples and mock catalogues of the Las Campanas redshift survey (LCRS), we show
(1) the slice-like geometry of the LCRS doesn't affect the off-diagonal power
spectrum with ``slice-like'' mode; (2) the Poisson sampling with the LCRS
selection function doesn't cause more than 1-$\sigma$ error in the DWT power
spectrum; and (3) the powers of peculiar velocity fluctuations, which cause the
redshift distortion, are approximately scale-independent. These results insure
that the uncertainties of the power spectrum measurement are under control. The
scatter of the DWT power spectra of the six strips of the LCRS survey is found
to be rather small. It is less than 1-$\sigma$ of the cosmic variance of mock
samples in the wavenumber range $0.1 < k < 2$ h Mpc$^{-1}$. To fit the detected
LCRS diagonal DWT power spectrum with CDM models, we find that the best-fitting
redshift distortion parameter $\beta$ is about the same as that obtained from
the Fourier power spectrum. The velocity dispersions $\sigma_v$ for SCDM and
$\Lambda$CDM models are also consistent with other $\sigma_v$ detections with
the LCRS. A systematic difference between the best-fitting parameters of
diagonal and off-diagonal power spectra has been significantly measured. This
indicates that the off-diagonal power spectra are capable of providing

almost comparable to that of galaxies at the present day if Omega_m=0.3 and
Omega_Lambda=0.7 (the Lambda cosmology), and a factor of ~3 lower if Omega_m=1

factor of ~10 lower than that measured for Abell clusters at the present day.
At larger scales, the QSO power spectra continue to rise robustly to ~400
h^{-1}Mpc, implying more power at large scales than in the APM galaxy power
spectrum measured by Baugh & Efstathiou.
  We split the QSO sample into two redshift bins and find little evolution in
the amplitude of the power spectrum. The QSO power spectrum may show a spike
feature at ~90h^{-1}Mpc assuming the Lambda cosmology or ~65 h^{-1}Mpc assuming
an EdS cosmology. Although the spike appears to reproduce in both the North and
South strips and in two independent redshift ranges, its statistical
significance is still marginal and more data is needed to test further its
reality.

Josephson effect. Starting from the work of Raghavan, Smerzi, Fantoni, and

aspect ratio, the Gaussian barrier height and width, and the total number of
atoms in the condensate. We also compare results for ${}^{23}$Na and

depends strongly on the aspect ratio of the harmonic trap and can be maximized
in a ``pancake'' trap, as used in the experiment of Anderson and Kasevich.

etching of a disordered-solid. The theory is based on a recently proposed
dynamical etching model. Through the introduction of a set of Langevin
equations for the model evolution, we are able to map the problem into a field
theory related to isotropic percolation. To the best of the authors knowledge,
it constitutes the first application of field theory to a problem of chemical
dynamics. By using this mapping, many of the etching process critical
properties are seen to be describable in terms of the percolation
renormalization group fixed point. The emerging field theory has the
peculiarity of being ``{\it self-organized}'', in the sense that without any
parameter fine-tuning, the system develops fractal properties up to certain
scale controlled solely by the volume, $V$, of the etching solution.

becomes scale invariant. We present also a finite size scaling analysis and
discuss the relation of this particular etching mechanism with Gradient
Percolation.
  Finally, the possibility of considering this mechanism as a new generic path
to self-organized criticality is analyzed, with the characteristics of being
closely related to a real physical system and therefore more directly
accessible to experiments.

one-dimensional disordered Peierls systems in which fluctuation effects of a
backscattering potential play a crucial role. The low-energy behavior of
non-interacting fermions which are subject to a static random backscattering
potential will be described by the fluctuating gap model (FGM). Recently, the
FGM has also been used to explain the pseudogap phenomenon in high-$T_c$
superconductors. After an elementary introduction to the FGM in the context of
commensurate and incommensurate Peierls chains, we develop a non-perturbative
method which allows for a simultaneous calculation of the density of states
(DOS) and the inverse localization length. First, we recover all known results
in the limits of zero and infinite correlation lengths of the random potential.
Then, we attack the problem of finite correlation lengths. While a complex
order parameter, which describes incommensurate Peierls chains, leads to a
suppression of the DOS, i.e. a pseudogap, the DOS exhibits a singularity at the
Fermi energy if the order parameter is real and therefore refers to a
commensurate system. We confirm these results by calculating the DOS and the
inverse localization length for finite correlation lengths and Gaussian
statistics of the backscattering potential with unprecedented accuracy
numerically. Finally, we consider the case of classical phase fluctuations
which apply to low temperatures where amplitude fluctuations are frozen out. In
this physically important regime, which is also characterized by finite
correlation lengths, we present analytic results for the DOS, the inverse
localization length, the specific heat, and the Pauli susceptibility.

finite-temperature, long-wavelength, isotropic electric conductivity that
diverges as a power law in temperature $T$ as $T \to 0$. This two-dimensional
system has many properties of a true isotropic Luttinger liquid, though at zero

involving compact spatial dimensions of scale 1/R \approx 1 TeV. The higher
dimensional theory is supersymmetric, and hence requires the top-quark Yukawa
coupling to be localized on some ``Yukawa brane'' in the bulk. The short
distance divergence in the Higgs-boson mass is regulated because supersymmetry
is unbroken in the vicinity of this Yukawa brane. A finite, negative Higgs
mass-squared is generated radiatively by the top-quark supermultiplet
propagating a distance of order R from the Yukawa brane to probe supersymmetry
breaking. The physics of electroweak symmetry breaking is therefore closely
related to this top propagation across the bulk, and is dominated by the mass
scale 1/R, with exponential insensitivity to higher energy scales. The masses
of the superpartners and the Kaluza-Klein resonances are also set by the mass
scale 1/R, which is naturally larger than the W boson mass by a loop factor.
  Explicit models are constructed which are highly constrained and predictive.
The finite radiative correction to the Higgs mass is computed, and the Higgs
sector briefly explored. The superpartner and Kaluza-Klein resonance spectra
are calculated, and the problem of flavor violation from squark and slepton
exchange is solved. Important collider signatures include highly ionizing
charged tracks from stable top squarks, and events with two Higgs bosons and
missing transverse energy.

emitted parton is a participant in two different subcollisions. The LDC model,
developed in Lund to describe DIS, provides a very convenient formalism to
handle these problems. The result is a dynamical suppression of minijets for

geometry of simple (or pure) spinors, as bilinearly underlying euclidean
geometry, may be extended also to quantum mechanics of fermions (in first
quantization), however in compact momentum spaces, bilinearly constructed with
spinors, with signatures unambiguously resulting from the construction, up to
sixteen component Majorana-Weyl spinors associated with the real Clifford
algebra $\Cl(1,9)$, where, because of the known periodicity theorem, the
construction naturally ends. $\Cl(1,9)$ may be formulated in terms of the
octonion division algebra, at the origin of SU(3) internal symmetry.
  In this approach the extra dimensions beyond 4 appear as interaction terms in
the equations of motion of the fermion multiplet; more precisely the directions
from 5$^{th}$ to 8$^{th}$ correspond to electric, weak and isospin interactions
$(SU(2) \otimes U(1))$, while those from 8$^{th}$ to 10$^{th}$ to strong ones
SU(3). There seems to be no need of extra dimension in configuration-space.
Only four dimensional space-time is needed - for the equations of motion and
for the local fields - and also naturally generated by four-momenta as
Poincar\'e translations.
  This spinor approach could be compatible with string theories and even
explain their origin, since also strings may be bilinearly obtained from simple
(or pure) spinors through sums; that is integrals of null vectors.

These theories are constructed based upon the maximal subgroups of the gauge

types of superloop superalgebra additional symmetries corresponding to the
positive-grade and negative-grade parts of certain superloop superalgebras. The
second main result is the systematic construction of the full algebra of

non- trivial modifications of the Virasoro flows known from the general case of

laser field and an electron moving in a potential which has a discrete
cylindrical symmetry with respect to the laser pulse propagation direction.
This setup serves as a simple model, e.g., for benzene and other aromatic
compounds. From general symmetry considerations, within a Floquet approach,
selection rules for the harmonic generation [O. Alon Phys. Rev. Lett. 80 3743
(1998)] have been derived recently. Instead, the results we present in this
paper have been obtained solving the time-dependent Schroedinger equation ab
initio for realistic pulse shapes. We find a rich structure which is not always
dominated by the laser harmonics.

this can be done reliably. The $N$ party GHZ is one such state; I derive a
large class of such states, and show that they are in general not equivalent to
the GHZ. I also briefly discuss the problem where the parties do not cooperate,

underlie the reader's own way of making sense of quantum mechanics. The article
ends up embracing a Vedantic world view, for two reasons. For one, such a world

one. For another, quantum mechanics is inconsistent with a materialistic world
view but makes perfect sense within a Vedantic framework of thought.

makes use of a nonlinear deformation of the usual su(2) algebra and when some
physical parameter, dictated by the particular model under consideration,
becomes small, it gives a diagonal effective Hamiltonian that describes
correctly the dynamics for arbitrary states and long times. We extend the
technique to $N$-level atomic systems interacting with quantum fields, finding
the corresponding effective Hamiltonians when the condition of $k$-photon
resonance is fulfilled.

Schrodinger operator without calculating the eigenfunctions. Following the

CFM to optimise the potential parameters in order to reproduce the experimental
