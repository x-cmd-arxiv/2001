the Universe must be dark. We discuss the likelihood that some of these dark
baryons may reside in galaxies as Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs), the
remnants of a first generation of pregalactic or protogalactic stars. Various
candidates have been proposed for such remnants and we review the many types of
observations which can be used to detect or exclude them. Claims to have found
positive evidence for some of the candidates have generally turned out to be
spurious or questionable, so the status of the MACHO scenario remains
controversial. However, it would be premature to reject MACHOs altogether and
further observations are likely to resolve the issue soon.

can place important constraints on models of the early Universe. An especially
interesting development has been the realization that such constraints may be
severely modified if the value of the gravitational ""constant"" G varies with
cosmological epoch, a possibility which arises in many scenarios for the early
Universe. The nature of the modification depends upon whether the value of $G$
near a black hole maintains the value it had at its formation epoch
(corresponding to gravitational memory) or whether it tracks the background
cosmological value. This is still uncertain but we discuss various approaches
which might help to resolve the issue.

S\'ersic r^{1/n} law in modelling the luminosity profiles of early type
galaxies. The first issue deals with the trend between the half-light radius
and the structural parameter n. We show that the correlation between these two
parameters is not only real, but is a natural consequence from the previous
relations found to exist between the model-independent parameters: total
luminosity, effective radius and effective surface brightness. We also define a
new galaxy concentration index which is largely independent of the image
exposure depth, and monotonically related with n. The second question concerns
the curious coincidence between the form of the Fundamental Plane and the
coupling between <I>_e and r_e when modelling a light profile. We explain,
through a mathematical analysis of the S\'ersic law, why the quantity
r_e<I>_e^{0.7} appears almost constant for an individual galaxy, regardless of
the value of n (over a large range) adopted in the fit to the light profile.
Consequently, Fundamental Planes of the form r_e<I>_e^{0.7} propto sigma_0^x
(for any x, and where sigma_0 is the central galaxy velocity dispersion) are
insensitive to galaxy structure. Finally, we address the problematic issue of
the use of model-dependent galaxy light profile parameters versus
model-independent quantities for the half-light radii, mean surface brightness
and total galaxy magnitude. The former implicitly assume that the light profile
model can be extrapolated to infinity, while the latter quantities, in general,
are derived from a signal-to-noise truncated profile. We quantify
(mathematically) how these parameters change as one reduces the outer radius of
an r^{1/n} profile, and reveal how these can vary substantially when n>4.

  Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/322956",,"astro-ph",,"  The effect of magnetic shear and shear flow on local gravitationally induced
instabilities is investigated. A simple model is constructed allowing for an
arbitrary entropy gradient and a shear plasma flow in the Boussinesq
approximation. A transformation to shearing magnetic coordinates achieves a
model with plasma flow along the magnetic field lines where the coordinate
lines are coincident with the field lines. The solution for the normal modes of
the system depends on two parameters: the Alfven Mach number of the plasma flow
and the entropy gradient. The behavior of the unstable normal modes of this
system is summarized by a stability diagram. Important characteristics of this
stability diagram are the following: magnetic shear is stabilizing and the
entropy gradient must exceed a threshold value for unstable mode growth to
occur; flow acts to suppress mode growth in a substantially unstable regime as
expected, yet near marginal stability it can lessen the stabilizing effect of
magnetic shear and enhance the growth rates of the instability; and, as the
Alfven Mach number approaches one, the instability is completely stabilized.
Analytical work is presented supporting the characteristics of the stability
diagram and illuminating the physical mechanisms controlling the behavior of
the model. The implications of this work for astrophysical and fusion
applications and the potential for future research extending the results to
include compressibility are discussed.

prior to the activity which earned it its Blue Compact Dwarf/Wolf-Rayet galaxy
classification. The detection of luminous, asymptotic giant branch stars
requires that stars formed vigorously several hundred Myr ago. The
well-populated red giant branch indicates stars with ages of at least 1-2 Gyr

the accretion flow meets the star, we show that there is an extended settling
region which is well-described by two self-similar solutions: (1) a
two-temperature solution which is valid in an inner zone $r\le10^{2.5}$ ($r$ is
in Schwarzchild units), and (2) a one-temperature solution at larger radii. In
both zones, $\rho\propto r^{-2}, \Omega\propto r^{-3/2}, v\propto r^0,\
T_p\propto r^{-1}$; in the two-temperature zone, $T_e\propto r^{-1/2}$. The
luminosity of the settling zone arises from the rotational energy of the star
as the star is braked by viscosity; hence the luminosity is independent of
$\dot M$. The settling solution is convectively and viscously stable and is
unlikely to have strong winds or outflows. The flow is thermally unstable, but
the instability may be stabilized by thermal conduction. The settling solution
described here is not advection-dominated, and is thus different from the
self-similar ADAF found around black holes. When the spin of the star is small
enough, however, the present solution transforms smoothly to a (settling) ADAF.

in the interaction basis, elastic collisions convert some of heavy eigenstates

distance of 470 pc) with a spatial resolution of about 0.4 parsec. Thanks to
the high sensitivity to faint surface brightness gradients, we have found
several cold condensations with temperatures ranging from 12 to 17 K, within 3
parsecs of the dense ridge. The statistical analysis of the temperature and
spectral index spatial distribution shows an evidence of an inverse correlation
between these two parameters. Being invisible in the IRAS 100 micron survey,
some cold clouds are likely to be the seeds for future star formation activity
going on in the complex. We estimate their masses and we show that two of them
have masses higher than their Jeans masses, and may be gravitationally
unstable.

energy density of the multi-component Fermi gas is calculated in Thomas-Fermi
approximation. On this basis the stability of the one- and two-component Fermi
gas against mean-field induced collapse is investigated. Explicit stability
conditions in terms of density and total particle number are given. For the
single-component system attractive p-wave interactions limit the density of the
gas. In the two-component case a subtle competition of s- and p-wave

p-wave part, for example, can stabilize a two-component system that would
otherwise collapse due to an attractive s-wave interaction. It is concluded
that the p-wave interaction may have important influence on the structure of
degenerate Fermi gases and should not be discarded from the outset.

'fair' market, the wealth distribution among individual investors fulfills a
power law. We then argue that 'fair play' for capital and minimal
socio-biological needs of the humans traps the economy within a power law
wealth distribution with a particular Pareto exponent $\alpha \sim 3/2$. In
particular we relate it to the average number of individuals L depending on the
average wealth: $\alpha \sim L/(L-1)$. Then we connect it to certain power
exponents characterising the stock markets. We obtain that the distribution of
volumes of the individual (buy and sell) orders follows a power law with
similar exponent $\beta \sim \alpha \sim 3/2$. Consequently, in a market where
trades take place by matching pairs of such sell and buy orders, the
corresponding exponent for the market returns is expected to be of order
$\gamma \sim 2 \alpha \sim 3$. These results are consistent with recent

statistical mechanical aspects of this phenomenon, starting from a purely
Hamiltonian formulation. The macroscopic measurement apparatus is modeled as an
ideal Bose gas, the order parameter of which, that is, the amplitude of the
condensate, is the pointer variable. It is shown that properties of
irreversibility and ergodicity breaking, which are inherent in the model
apparatus, ensure the appearance of definite results of the measurement, and
provide a dynamical realization of wave-function reduction or collapse. The
measurement process takes place in two steps: First, the reduction of the state
of the tested system occurs over a time of order $\hbar/(TN^{1/4})$, where $T$
is the temperature of the apparatus, and $N$ is the number of its degrees of
freedom. This decoherence process is governed by the apparatus-system
interaction. During the second step classical correlations are established
between the apparatus and the tested system over the much longer time-scale of
equilibration of the apparatus. The influence of the parameters of the model on
non-ideality of the measurement is discussed. Schr\""{o}dinger kittens, EPR

Language-independent prototype models are constructed which are instantiated on

of phonotactic models that encode arbitrarily close approximations of a
language's set of attested phonological forms. The approach is applied to the

off-axis scattering (waves incident along directions misaligned with the black
hole's rotation axis) are obtained for the first time. Inspection of the

Schwarzschild scattering. In particular, the cross sections are dominated by
the glory effect and the forward (Coulomb) divergence due to the long-range
nature of the gravitational field. In the rotating case the overall diffraction
pattern is ``frame-dragged'' and as a result the glory maximum is not observed

algebra techniques the fundamental sum rules can be expressed into expectation
values of (partially) conserved (axial-) vector currents sandwiched between
hadronic states. These expectation values yield the quantum numbers of the
corresponding hadron which are determined by the underlying flavour group
$SU(n)_F$. In this case one can show that there exist an intimate relation
between the appearance of power and QCD corrections. The above features do not
hold for phenomenological sum rules, hereafter called non-fundamental. They
have no foundation in quantum field theory and they mostly depend on certain

renormalized mass coincides with a real part of the position of the complex
pole of the corresponding propagator, (ii) the imaginary part of the on-shell

experiments are monitoring the flux of B solar neutrinos through the electron
energy spectrum from the reactions nu_{e,mu,tau} + e --> nu_{e,mu,tau} + e and
nu_e + d --> p + p + e, respectively. We show that the SK detector response to
B neutrinos in each bin of the electron energy spectrum (above 8 MeV) can be
approximated, with good accuracy, by the SNO detector response in an
appropriate electron energy range (above 5.1 MeV). For instance, the SK
response in the bin [10,10.5] MeV is reproduced (``equalized'') within 2
percent by the SNO response in the range [7.1,11.75] MeV. As a consequence, in
the presence of active neutrino oscillations, the SK and SNO event rates in the
corresponding energy ranges turn out to be linearly related, for any functional
form of the oscillation probability. Such equalization is not spoiled by the
possible contribution of hep neutrinos (within current phenomenological
limits). In perspective, when the SK and the SNO spectra will both be measured
with high accuracy, the SK-SNO equalization can be used to determine the
absolute B neutrino flux, and to cross-check the (non)observation of spectral
deviations in SK and SNO. At present, as an exercise, we use the equalization
to ``predict'' the SNO energy spectrum, on the basis of the current SK data.
Finally, we briefly discuss some modifications or limitations of our results in
the case of sterile neutrino oscillations and of relatively large Earth matter
effects.

non-relativistically. This means that the modes produced during reheating can
easily be the dominant component. For instance, for two extra dimensions the
bound on their radii from considering only the thermally produced KK modes is R
< 1.1 x 10^-4 mm. If the modes produced during reheating are also accounted
for, the bound is strengthened to R < 2.2 x 10^-5 mm. This bound is stronger

two point function in position space of the insertion of certain composite
operators. We demonstrate that, even at tree level, many of the by now familiar

non-commutative directions: this comes about because these are theories of

  includes a proof of Fontaine's monodromy conjecture and some applications.
  Submitted for publication",,"10.1007/s002220100202",,"math.NT math.AC math.AG",,"  In this paper, we associate to every $p$-adic representation $V$ a $p$-adic
differential equation $\mathbf{D}^{\dagger}_{\mathrm{rig}}(V)$, that is to say
a module with a connection over the Robba ring. We do this via the theory of
Fontaine's $(\phi,\Gamma_K)$-modules.
  This construction enables us to relate the theory of
$(\phi,\Gamma_K)$-modules to $p$-adic Hodge theory. We explain how to construct
$mathbf{D}_{mathrm{cris}}(V)$ and $\mathbf{D}_{\mathrm{st}}(V)$ from
$\mathbf{D}^{\dagger}_{\mathrm{rig}}(V)$, which allows us to recognize
semi-stable or crystalline representations; the connection is then either
unipotent or trivial on $\mathbf{D}^{\dagger}_{\mathrm{rig}}(V)[1/t]$.
  In general, the connection has an infinite number of regular singularities,
but we show that $V$ is de Rham if and only if those are apparent
singularities. A structure theorem for modules over the Robba ring allows us to
get rid of all singularities at once, and to obtain a ``classical''
differential equation, with a Frobenius structure. A recent theorem of Y.
Andr\'e gives a complete description of the structure of such an object. This
allows us to prove Fontaine's $p$-adic monodromy conjecture: every de Rham

semi-stability of ordinary representations), of Colmez (absolutely crystalline

higher costs, effectively performing a quality control. The statistical
structure of signal usage is predicted to be of a generalised Boltzmann form
that penalises signals that are costly and sensitive to errors. This predicted
distribution of signal usage against signal cost has two main features: an
exponential tail required for cost efficiency and an underutilisation of the
low cost signals required to protect the signalling quality from the errors.
These predictions are shown to correspond quantitatively to the experiments in
