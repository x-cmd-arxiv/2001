surveys to measure the density parameter Omega_m and the matter and
galaxy-galaxy power spectra. The datasets are PSCz, ORS, Mark III and SFI. The
LAP method is applied on the surveys simultaneously, resulting in an
overconstrained dynamical system that describes the cosmic overdensities and
velocity flows. The system is solved by relaxing the constraint that each
survey imposes upon the cosmic fields. A least-squares optimization of the
errors that arise in the process yields the cosmic fields and the value of
Omega_m that is the best fit to the ensemble of datasets. The analysis has been
carried out with a high-resolution Gaussian smoothing of 500 km/s and over a
spherical selected volume of radius 9,000 km/s. We have assigned a weight to
each survey, depending on their density of sampling, and this parameter
determines their relative influence in limiting the domain of the overall
solution. The influence of each survey on the final value of Omega_m, the
cosmographical features of the cosmic fields and the power spectra largely
depends on the distribution function of the errors in the relaxation of the
constraints. We find that PSCz and Mark III are closer to the final solution
than ORS and SFI. The likelihood analysis yields Omega_m= 0.37\pm 0.01 to
1sigma level. PSCz and SFI are the closest to this value, whereas ORS and Mark
III predict a somewhat lower Omega_m. The model of bias employed is a
scale-dependent one, and we retain up to 42 bias coefficients b_{rl} in the
spherical harmonics formalism. The predicted power spectra are estimated in the
range of wavenumbers 0.02-0.49h Mpc^{-1}, and we compare these results with
measurements recently reported in the literature.

of the 19 targets, samples the rest-frame optical emission longwards of the

compact systems, to systems with substructures such as multiple emission peaks,
to systems comprised of several components spread over large areas. The
morphologies of 5 of the lowest redshift targets are well represented by a de
Vaucouleurs profile, consistent with them being elliptical galaxies. Their
average effective radius is a factor of 2 smaller than that of z=1 3CR radio
galaxies at similar restframe wavelengths. The near infrared continuum light is
generally well aligned with the radio axis and the aligned light has typical
V-H colors of around 3.5-4. For several galaxies where WFPC2 images were
available, we computed a high resolution map of the optical-to-infrared
spectral indices: all multi-component systems present net color gradients
between the various clumps. We argue that in these galaxies the continuum
emission has probably a stellar origin. Finally in many cases we observe nearby
faint objects close to the radio sources. The number density of these faint
objects is slightly higher than what is found in the deep NICMOS parallel
observations of random fields. These objects also tend to be aligned with the

both the 178 MHz luminosity and the redshift match as close as possible between
the radio galaxy and the quasar in order to minimize effects of cosmic
evolution. 13 of the 20 sources were detected in at least one waveband. 12
sources show clear evidence of a thermal bump at FIR wavelength, while in the
remaining 7 sources the upper limits are still compatible with the presence of
luminous dust emission. In agreement with the predictions of the unified
scheme, the quasars and galaxies in our sample cannot be distinguished by their
observed mid- and far-infrared properties. This is in contrast to the IRAS
results which indicated that radio galaxies radiate significantly less mid- to
far-infrared emission than quasars. However, the IRAS samples are dominated by
low-redshift sources (z < 0.5), while our sample contains several of the most
luminous radio galaxies at redshift z ~ 1. The latter have already been
suspected to contain a hidden quasar for other reasons, e.g. an extended
emission line region aligned with the radio axis. From the ratio between FIR
luminosity emitted by dust and the radio power at 178 MHz, we conclude that the
radio galaxy/quasar unification might be perfectly valid for the most luminous
3C sources at high redshift (z > 0.8). At lower redshifts (z < 0.5), however,
some of the FRII radio galaxies contain active nuclei which emit less
UV-optical continuum than the quasars of similar radio power. (abrigded)

velocities, dn/d v_c. These dynamical variables depend on the halo structure as
well as the halo mass. Since baryonic physics, particularly cooling,
significantly modifies the central density structure of dark matter halos, both
observational distributions show a feature corresponding to the mass scale
below which the baryons in the halo can cool (i.e. galaxies versus clusters).
We use simplified but self-consistent models to show that the structural
changes to the halos produced by the cooling baryons explain both
distributions. Given a fixed halo mass function, matching the observed image
separation distribution or local velocity function depends largely on Omega_b

with a mean interval of about seven days after the end of the main outburst in
1996/1997. Most unusual was that the star abruptly entered into a deep faint
minimum after such frantic activities. We propose that this peculiar phenomenon
may be understoodin terms of viscosity decay in the cold disk. In this picture,
the viscosity is produced by MHD turbulence due to the magneto-rotational
instability ('Balbus-Hawley instability') and dies down exponentially with time
when the disk becomes cold because the magnetic fields decay due to finite
conductivity in the cold disk (Gammie & Menou 1998). But the viscosity is
refreshed to a high value every time when a mini-outburst occurs (i.e., the
disk becomes hot again). It is argued that a sudden cessation of repetitive
mini-outbursts may be brought about by a very small reduction in viscosity or a
small increase in its decay rate, which may in turn be produced most likely by
stochastic fluctuations of magnetic fields. Numerical simulations based on a
simple model reproduce the observed light curve of EG Cancri very well. We
discuss possible causes why the reflares after the main outburst occur mostly
in the WZ Sge-type stars.

modelled as random graphs. The eigenvalue spectrum of these graphs provides
information about their structural properties. While the semi-circle law is
known to describe the spectral density of uncorrelated random graphs, much less
is known about the eigenvalues of real-world graphs, describing such complex
systems as the Internet, metabolic pathways, networks of power stations,
scientific collaborations or movie actors, which are inherently correlated and
usually very sparse. An important limitation in addressing the spectra of these
systems is that the numerical determination of the spectra for systems with
more than a few thousand nodes is prohibitively time and memory consuming.
Making use of recent advances in algorithms for spectral characterization, here
we develop new methods to determine the eigenvalues of networks comparable in
size to real systems, obtaining several surprising results on the spectra of
adjacency matrices corresponding to models of real-world graphs. We find that
when the number of links grows as the number of nodes, the spectral density of
uncorrelated random graphs does not converge to the semi-circle law.
Furthermore, the spectral densities of real-world graphs have specific features
depending on the details of the corresponding models. In particular, scale-free
graphs develop a triangle-like spectral density with a power law tail, while
small-world graphs have a complex spectral density function consisting of
several sharp peaks. These and further results indicate that the spectra of
correlated graphs represent a practical tool for graph classification and can
provide useful insight into the relevant structural properties of real
networks.

compete for equal q-vectors. It is argued that the wavelengths of spin-wave

This mechanism supports the idea that pseudogaps are caused by stripe like
spin-modulations in underdoped systems, while superconductivity is attributed
to enhanced electron-phonon coupling for long wavelength phonons.

This vortex motion sets the limiting critical current density Jc in the

give a precise formulation of a weak unitarity constraint and show that a

promoting the original D-brane category to an enlarged category constructed by
using certain generalized complexes of D-branes. I give a detailed construction

observed for central PbPb collisions.
  This seems to imply that the pion phase density has reached a limit.
  The source size of different particles decreases with mass when the
transverse velocity is held constant but increases with mass when the
transverse mass is held constant. The antiproton source radius is larger than
the proton source radius. So far no long lived source has been seen. The pion
source size varies slowly with rapidity but more rapidly with transverse mass
implying strong transverse flow. There is very slow increase of pion radii with
sqrt{s}.

to nucleon-nucleon collisions are included beyond the usual mean-field
description. We emphasize the importance of both mechanism in the fragmentation

in terms of percentage of Energy-Weighted Sum-Rules in various energy regions.
We obtained reasonable agreement in all cases. A special attention as been
given to the fragmentation of the Giant Quadrupole Resonance in calcium and

vortices that fall (randomly) very close to the spatial points where the
velocity is being sampled. We confirm that these events lead to a non-Gaussian
high-velocity ``tail'' on an otherwise Gaussian distribution function for the
Eulerian velocity field. We also investigate the behavior of distributions that
do not have equilibrium mean-field probability distributions that are uniform
inside the circle, but instead correspond to both higher and lower mean-field
energies than those associated with the uniform vorticity distribution. We find
substantial differences between these and the uniform case.

scientific discoveries of the last century. Although these two areas initially
developed separately it has emerged that they are in fact intimately related.
In this review I will show how quantum information theory extends traditional
information theory by exploring the limits imposed by quantum, rather than
classical mechanics on information storage and transmission. The derivation of
many key results uniquely differentiates this review from the ""usual""
presentation in that they are shown to follow logically from one crucial
property of relative entropy. Within the review optimal bounds on the speed-up
that quantum computers can achieve over their classical counter-parts are
outlined using information theoretic arguments. In addition important
implications of quantum information theory to thermodynamics and quantum
measurement are intermittently discussed. A number of simple examples and
derivations including quantum super-dense coding, quantum teleportation,
Deutsch's and Grover's algorithms are also included.

function in usual coordinates and momenta and a density matrix in the charge
variable. It is possible to introduce the usual Wigner function for a large
class of dynamical variables. Such an approach explicitly contains a measuring
device frame. From our point of view it corresponds to the Copenhagen
interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is shown how physical properties of
such particles depend on the definition of the coordinate operator. The
evolution equation for the Wigner function of a single-charge state in the
classical limit coincides with the Liouville equation. Localization
peculiarities manifest themselves in specific constraints on possible initial
conditions.

experimental information is governed by the multinomial probability
distribution. There exist unique random variables, whose standard deviation
becomes asymptotically invariant of physical conditions. Representing all
information by means of such random variables gives the quantum mechanical
probability amplitude and a real alternative. For predictions, the linear
evolution law (Schrodinger or Dirac equation) turns out to be the only way to
extend the invariance property of the standard deviation to the predicted
quantities. This indicates that quantum theory originates in the structure of
gaining pure, probabilistic information, without any mechanical underpinning.
