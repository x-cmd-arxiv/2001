similar to that already predicted with semi-analytic approaches, the detailed

behave differently with time, and the spectrum above the final break is harder
than previously expected. These effects are due to the incorporation of the
geometry of the (spherical) blastwave, along with relativistic beaming and
adiabatic cooling of the energetic particles leading to a mix, in the observed
spectrum, between recently injected ""uncooled"" particles and the older ""cooled""
population in different parts of the evolving, inhomogeneous flow.

an isotropic explosion in a constant density medium is unable to simultaneously
fit both the radio and optical data. However, a jet-like outflow with an
opening angle of 10-20 degress provides a good description of the data. The
evidence in favor of a jet interpretation is based on the behavior of the radio
light curves, since the expected jet break is masked at optical wavelengths by
the light of the host galaxy. We also find evidence for extinction, presumably
arising from within the host galaxy, with A(V)=0.4 mag, and host flux densities
of F_R=1.1 uJy and F_K=1.7 uJy. These values supercede previous work on this

NGC 1705. These data allow us for the first time to probe the coronal-phase gas
(T = 10E5 to 10E6 K) that may dominate the radiative cooling of the
supernova-heated ISM and thereby determine the dynamical evolution of
starburst-driven outflows. We detect a broad (100 km/s) and blueshifted (by 80
km/s) OVI absorption-line arising in the previously-known galactic outflow. The
properties of the OVI absorption are inconsistent with the standard superbubble
model in which this gas arises in a conductive interface inside the outer
shell. We show that the superbubble in NGC 1705 is blowing out of the galaxy
ISM. During blow-out, coronal-phase gas can be created by hydrodynamical mixing
as hot gas rushes out through fissures in the fragmenting shell of cool gas. As
the coronal gas cools radiatively, it can naturally produce the observed OVI
column density and outflow speed. The OVI data show that the cooling rate in
the coronal-phase gas is less than about 10% of the supernova heating rate.
Since the X-ray luminosity from hotter gas is even smaller, we conclude that
radiative losses are insignificant. The outflow should be able to vent its
metals and kinetic energy out of the galaxy. This process has potentially
important implications for the evolution of dwarf galaxies and the IGM.

suggesting that they correspond to stellar bars in S0 galaxies. We analyze the

dichotomy found in previous HST surveys: bright, boxy ellipticals with shallow
inner cusps (`core' galaxies) on one hand and faint, disky ellipticals with
steep central cusps (`power-law' galaxies) on the other hand. The advantages
and shortcomings of classification schemes utilizing the extrapolated central
cusp slope are discussed, and it is shown that this cusp slope might be an
inadequate representation for galaxies whose luminosity profile slope changes
smoothly with radius rather than resembling a broken power-law. In fact, we
find evidence for an `intermediate' class of galaxies, that cannot
unambiguously be classified as either core or power-law galaxies, and which
have central cusp slopes and absolute magnitudes intermediate between those of

tailor the velocity ellipsoid directly to the geometry of the mass
distribution. Thus we avoid computing the anisotropic velocity dispersions
which leads to large savings in the cpu budget. The computational time of the
algorithm for triaxial equilibria scales linearly with the number of particles,
N. The approximate solution to the velocity field causes structural relaxation:
tests with N = 50,000 show that fluctuations of the inertia tensor (not
exceeding the 10 per cent level) disappear within one half of a revolution at
the half-mass radius. At later times equilibrium properties settle to values
close to those sought from the initial conditions.
  A disc component is then added as described by Hernquist (1993).
Incorporating the above algorithm to his code BuildGal, test runs show that the
stability of the disc against vertical heating is not substantially modified by
using our method.

North-West. The surface brightness edge and the plateau can be modeled as a gas
density discontinuity (jump) and a slope change (break). The temperature
profiles suggest that the jump and the break are the boundaries of a central,
group-size (d=380h_50^{-1} kpc), dense, cold (T=4 keV) gas cloud, embedded in a
diffuse hot (T=10 keV) intracluster medium. The density jump and the
temperature change across the discontinuity are similar to the ``cold fronts''
discovered by Chandra in A2142 and A3667, and suggest subsonic motion of this
central gas cloud with respect to the cluster itself. The most natural
explanation is that we are observing a merger in the very last stage before the
cluster becomes fully relaxed. However, the data are also consistent with an
alternative scenario in which RXJ1720.1+2638 is the result of the collapse of
two co-located density perturbations, the first a group-scale perturbation
collapse followed by a second cluster-scale perturbation collapse that
surrounded, but did not destroy, the first one. We also show that, because of
the core motion, the total mass inside the cluster core, derived under the
assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, may underestimate the true cluster mass.
If widespread, such motion may partially explain the discrepancy between X-ray

in 29 out of 67 galaxies (43%), including 12 with small nuclear dusty disks. In
a separate sample of 40 galaxies biased for the detection of dust by virtue of
their detection in the IRAS 100 micron band, dust is found in ~78% of the
galaxies, 15 of which contain dusty disks. In those galaxies with detectable
dust, the apparent mass of the dust correlates with radio and far infrared
luminosity, becoming more significant for systems with filamentary dust. A
majority of IRAS and radio detections are also associated with dusty galaxies
rather than dustless galaxies. This indicates that thermal emission from
clumpy, filamentary dust is the main source of the far-IR radiation in early
type galaxies. Dust in small disk-like morphology tends to be well aligned with
the major axis of the host galaxies, while filamentary dust appears to be more
randomly distributed with no preference for alignment with any major galactic
structure. This suggests that, if the dusty disks and filaments have a common
origin, the dust originates externally and requires time to dynamically relax
and settle in the galaxy potential in the form of compact disks. More galaxies
with visible dust than without dust display emission lines, indicative of
ionized gas, although such nuclear activity does not show a preference for
dusty disk over filamentary dust. There appears to be a weak relationship
between the mass of the dusty disks and central velocity dispersion of the
galaxy, suggesting a connection with a similar recently recognized relationship
between the latter and the black hole mass.

perpendicular to the radio axis. Spectroscopy of this feature indicates the

Velocities of the emission- line gas associated with H II regions in the linear

consistent with the observed morphology. One possible scenario is an edge-on

symmetries of nature. Hypothesising that these symmetries exist implies the
existence of a new form of matter, called mirror matter. The mirror matter
theory (or exact parity model) makes four main predictions: 1) Dark matter in
the form of mirror matter should exist in the Universe (i.e. mirror galaxies,
stars, planets, meteoroids...), 2) Maximal ordinary neutrino - mirror neutrino
oscillations if neutrinos have mass, 3) Orthopositronium should have a shorter
effective lifetime than predicted by QED (in ""vacuum"" experiments) because of
the effects of photon-mirror photon mixing and 4) Higgs production and decay
rate should be 50% lower than in the standard model due to Higgs mirror - Higgs
mixing (assuming that the seperation of the Higgs masses is larger than their
decay widths). At the present time there is strong experimental/observational
evidence supporting the first three of these predictions, while the fourth one
is not tested yet because the Higgs boson, predicted in the standard model of
particle physics, is yet to be found. This experimental/observational evidence
is rich and varied ranging from the atmospheric and solar neutrino deficits,
MACHO gravitational microlensing events, strange properties of extra-solar
planets, the existence of ""isolated"" planets, orthopositronium lifetime
anomaly, Tunguska and other strange ""meteor"" events including perhaps, the
origin of the moon. The purpose of this article is to provide a not too

several thousand electrons. Transport through a quantum dot at low temperatures
is a quantum-coherent process. This review focuses on dots in which the
electron's dynamics are chaotic or diffusive, giving rise to statistical
properties that reflect the interplay between one-body chaos, quantum
interference, and electron-electron interactions. The conductance through such
dots displays mesoscopic fluctuations as a function of gate voltage, magnetic
field, and shape deformation. The techniques used to describe these
fluctuations include semiclassical methods, random-matrix theory, and the
supersymmetric nonlinear $\sigma$ model. In open dots, the approximation of
noninteracting quasiparticles is justified, and electron-electron interactions
contribute indirectly through their effect on the dephasing time at finite
temperature. In almost-closed dots, where conductance occurs by tunneling, the
charge on the dot is quantized, and electron-electron interactions play an
important role. Transport is dominated by Coulomb blockade, leading to peaks in
the conductance that at low temperatures provide information on the dot's
ground-state properties. Several statistical signatures of electron-electron
interactions have been identified, most notably in the dot's addition spectrum.
The dot's spin, determined partly by exchange interactions, can also influence
the fluctuation properties of the conductance. Other mesoscopic phenomena in
quantum dots that are affected by the charging energy include the fluctuations
of the cotunneling conductance and mesoscopic Coulomb blockade.

In accordance with the thermal annealing model, a detailed description of the

Gaussian pulse with a Si(100) substrate has been embedded into a
molecular-dynamics scheme. This was accomplished by explicitly accounting for
carrier-phonon scattering and carrier diffusion. Below the predicted threshold
fluence for ablation, $F_{th}=0.25 \text{J/cm}^{2}$, a surface breathing mode
indicates that the solid restores internal equilibrium by the generation of
pressure waves. Above $F_{th}$, our simulations reveal that matter removal is
triggered by subsurface superheating effects: intense heating of the material
leads to the thermal confinement of the laser-deposited energy. As a result,
the material is overheated up to a temperature corresponding to the critical
point of silicon and a strong pressure gradient builds up within the absorbing
volume. At the same time, diffusion of the carriers into the bulk leads to the
development of a steep temperature gradient beneath the surface. Matter removal
is subsequently driven by the relaxation of the pressure gradient: large pieces
--- several atomic layers thick --- of molten material are expelled from the
surface with initial axial velocities of $\sim 1000 \text{m/s}$, their ejection
following the nucleation of voids beneath the surface.

segregated using an appropriately chosen ratchet, even when the particles in
the two components have the same size, and differ only in their normal
restitution coefficient or friction coefficient. These results suggest that the
components of otherwise non-segregating granular mixtures may be separated
using our method.

the standard-model fields. The scale dependence will be written explicitly and
the full spectrum of supersymmetry breaking operators which emerges will be
explored. It will be shown that, contrary to common lore, scale-dependent
operators can play an important role in determining the phenomenology. For
example, theories with low-energy supersymmetry breaking, such as gauge
mediation, may correspond to a scalar potential which is quite different than
in theories with high-energy supersymmetry breaking, such as gravity mediation.

symmetry is effectively restored for highly-lying states, then the baryons
should fall into representations of $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ that are compatible
with the given parity of the states - the parity-chiral multiplets. We classify
all possible parity-chiral multiplets: (i) $(1/2,0)\oplus(0, 1/2)$ that contain
parity doublet for nucleon spectrum;(ii) $(3/2,0) \oplus (0, 3/2)$ consists of
the parity doublet for delta spectrum; (iii) $(1/2,1) \oplus (1, 1/2)$ contains
one parity doublet in the nucleon spectrum and one parity doublet in the delta
spectrum of the same spin that are degenerate in mass. Here we show that the
available spectroscopic data for nonstrange baryons in the $\sim$ 2 GeV range
is consistent with all possibilities, but the approximate degeneracy of parity
doublets in nucleon and delta spectra support the latter possibility with
excited baryons approximately falling into $(1/2,1) \oplus (1, 1/2)$

generalisation of a Hawking Turok instanton when the potential of the scalar
field is such that these instantons can exist. On continuation to Lorentzian
signature such instantons give rise to a spacetime in which all of the spatial
dimensions are of equal size and where the spatial topology is that of a
sphere. The extra dimensions are thus not hidden. In the case where the

  Kluwer Academic Press",,,,"hep-th hep-lat hep-ph",,"  It appears that string-M-theory is the only viable candidate for a complete
theory of matter. It must therefore contain both gravity and QCD. What is
particularly surprising is the recent conjecture that strongly coupled QCD
matrix elements can be evaluated though a duality with weakly coupled gravity.
To date there has been no direct verification of this conjecture by Maldacena
because of the difficulty of direct strong coupling calculations in gauge
theories. We report here on some progress in evaluating a gauge-invariant
correlator in the non-perturbative regime in two and three dimensions in SYM
theories. The calculations are made using supersymmetric discrete light-cone
quantization (SDLCQ). We consider a Maldacena-type conjecture applied to the
near horizon geometry of a D1-brane in the supergravity approximation, solve
the corresponding N=(8,8) SYM theory in two dimensions, and evaluate the
correlator of the stress-energy tensor. Our numerical results support the
Maldacena conjecture and are within 10-15% of the predicted results. We also
present a calculation of the stress-energy correlator in N=1 SYM theory in 2+1
dimensions. While there is no known duality relatingthis theory to
supergravity, the theory does have massless BPS states, and the correlator
gives important information about the BPS wave function in the non-perturbative
regime.

the charge itself. Thus, this central charge is clearly different from the
quantum anomaly which can be understood as the Jacobian factor of the path
integral measure. Alternatively, if we use the leading transformation, the
central charge arises from the fact that the boundary condition of the path
integral is not invariant under the transformation. This is in contrast to the
usual quantum central charge which arises from the fact that the measure of the
path integral is not invariant under the relevant transformation. Moreover, we
discuss the implications of our analysis in relation to the black hole entropy.

flow rises from the negative flow to the positive flow. Its magnitude depends
on the nuclear equation of state (EOS). However, the elliptic flow shows
decrease with increasing incident energy and its magnitude is not very sensible
to EOS. Systematic studies of the impact parameter dependence and cluster mass
dependence were also performed. The study of directed flow at intermediate
energies thus provides a means to extract the information on the nuclear

  The hypothesis was proposed that lexicographic ordering may be applied to the
complex physical quantities. A set of the ranked complex numbers is quite
natural to arrange on a straight line that represents in this case a
non-Archimedean complex numerical axis. All physical quantities are located on
the relevant non-Archimedean complex numerical axes, forming a new reality -
""complex-valued"" world.
  Thus, we get the conclusion that the resulting non-Archimedean complex
numerical axis may serve as an example of the ideal mathematical object -
hyperreal numerical axis. So, differentiation and integration on the
non-Archimedean complex numerical axis can be realized using methods of
nonstandard analysis.

searching an ordered list, sorting an un-ordered list, and deciding whether the
numbers in a list are all distinct. Letting N be the number of elements in the
input list, we prove a lower bound of \frac{1}{\pi}(\ln(N)-1) accesses to the
list elements for ordered searching, a lower bound of \Omega(N\log{N}) binary
comparisons for sorting, and a lower bound of \Omega(\sqrt{N}\log{N}) binary
comparisons for element distinctness. The previously best known lower bounds
are {1/12}\log_2(N) - O(1) due to Ambainis, \Omega(N), and \Omega(\sqrt{N}),
respectively. Our proofs are based on a weighted all-pairs inner product
argument.
  In addition to our lower bound results, we give a quantum algorithm for
ordered searching using roughly 0.631 \log_2(N) oracle accesses. Our algorithm
uses a quantum routine for traversing through a binary search tree faster than
classically, and it is of a nature very different from a faster algorithm due
to Farhi, Goldstone, Gutmann, and Sipser.

falsification of Bell's inequality, we conclude that the concept of ``possessed

sending signals to space-like separated regions. These arguments are critically
