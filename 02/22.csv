predictions for the distribution of galaxy clusters that will be observed by
the Planck Surveyor satellite through their effect on the cosmic microwave
background -- the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. We utilize the lightcone datasets
for both critical density (tauCDM) and flat low-density (LambdaCDM)
cosmologies: a `full-sky' survey out to $z \sim 0.5$, two `octant' datasets out
to beyond $z=1$ and a 100 square degree dataset extending to $z \sim 4$. Making
simple, but robust, assumptions regarding both the thermodynamic state of the
gas and the detection of objects against an unresolved background, we present
the expected number of SZ sources as a function of redshift and angular size,
and also by flux (for both the thermal and kinetic effects) for 3 of the
relevant HFI frequency channels. We confirm the expectation that Planck will
detect around $5\times 10^4$ clusters, though the exact number is sensitive to
the choice of several parameters including the baryon fraction, and also to the
cluster density profile, so that either cosmology may predict more clusters. We
also find that the majority of detected sources should be at $z<1.5$, and we
estimate that around one per cent of clusters will be spatially resolved by
Planck, though this has a large uncertainty.

Universe and therefore a fundamental topic of cosmology and astrophysics.
Recent radio, EUV, and X-ray observations suggest that clusters contain large
populations of diffuse nonthermal relativistic and/or superthermal particles.
These particles may be produced by acceleration in cluster merger shocks, AGNs,
and/or supernovae in cluster galaxies. Models for the nonthermal populations in
clusters indicate that they should produce substantial hard X-ray and $\gamma$
luminosities. The possible role of nonthermal particles in the dynamics of
clusters is one of the greatest uncertainties in their use as cosmological
probes. INTEGRAL offers, for the first time, the possibility of simultaneous
medium resolution imaging (~ 12 arcmin) and high resolution spectroscopy
(DeltaE/E ~ 2 keV @ 1.3 MeV) with exceptional sensitivity in the hard
X-ray/soft gamma-ray band. The spatial resolution will allow discrete sources,
such as AGNs, to be separated from the diffuse emission of the cluster. For
nearby clusters, the spatial distribution of emission can be determined and
compared to models for the nonthermal particle populations and observations in
other wavebands. The spectral capabilities may allow different components of
the nonthermal population to be detected separately. We present simulations of
INTEGRAL observations of nearby galaxy clusters that show its capability for
detecting the different phenomena responsible of clusters emission.

overall spectrum is typical for that of high redshift radio galaxies.
Interestingly, N V is present in the spectrum of the region associated with the
center of the galaxy hosting the radio source, the northern region, while
absent in the southern region. Using a simple photoionization model, the
difference in N V can be explained due to a metallicity gradient within the

massive cooling flow or originates from the debris of the merging of two or
more galaxies. However, also other mechanisms such as jet-cloud interactions or

magnetic fields and the fraction of volume that they occupy, explains the GRB

The wiggles on the string can drive the short-time structures of GRB. This

radiation which should be detectable by LIGO, VIRGO and LISA detectors. Another
prediction is the diffuse X- and gamma-ray radiation at 8 MeV - 100 GeV with a

Synthetic spectra are constructed duplicating the resolution, signal-to-noise
ratio, and wavelength coverage of several published high resolution spectra,
and their statistical properties compared on the basis of the flux distribution
of the spectra, the distribution of coefficients in a wavelet decomposition of
the spectra, and the distributions of absorption line profile parameters.
Agreement between the measured and predicted cumulative distributions is found
at the few to several percent level. The best-fitting models to the flux
distribution correspond to normalizations on the scale of the cosmological
Jeans length of 1.3 < sigma_J < 1.7 at z=3. No single model provides an
acceptable match to all the distributions. Larger median Doppler parameters are
found in the measured spectra than predicted by all but the lowest

indicate the need to introduce additional energy injection throughout the IGM,

(20<R<26) of massive clusters (sigma=1000 km/s) at intermediate redshifts,
where the bulk of the sources are at high redshifts compared to the cluster
redshift. If the lensing signal is measured out to 1.5 h_{50}^{-1} Mpc the
typical 1sigma relative uncertainty in the mass is about 6%. However, in other
situations the induced uncertainty can be larger. For instance, in the case of
nearby clusters, such as the Coma cluster, background structures introduce a
considerable uncertainty in the mass, limiting the maximum achievable S/N-ratio
to \sim 7, even for deep observations. The noise in the cluster mass estimate
caused by the large scale structure increases with increasing aperture size,
which will also complicate attempts to constrain cluster mass profiles at large
distances from the cluster centre. However, the distant large scale structure
studied here can be considered an additional (statistical) source of error, and
by averaging the results of several clusters the noise is decreased.

(Gamma) of S5 0836+710 is consistent with that found in previous observations
with ROSAT and ASCA, while the power law of PKS 2149-306 is harder than found
in a previous observation by ASCA. Excess continuum absorption above the

mechanism, the diffusive shock acceleration is reviewed. It is demonstrated
that its efficiency critically depends on the injection of thermal plasma into
acceleration which takes place at the subshock of the collisionless shock
structure that, in turn, can be significantly smoothed by energetic particles.
Furthermore, their inhomogeneous distribution provides free energy for MHD
turbulence regulating the subshock strength and injection rate. Moreover, the
MHD turbulence confines particles to the shock front controlling their maximum
energy and bootstrapping acceleration. Therefore, the study of the MHD
turbulence in a compressive plasma flow near a shock is a key to understanding
of the entire process. The calculation of the injection rate became part of the
collisionless shock theory. It is argued that the further progress in diffusive
shock acceleration theory is impossible without a significant advance in these

than blue GCs by about 20%. The size difference is seen at all radii and exists
also in the Milky Way and Sombrero (M104) spiral galaxies. Fitting t5 functions
to the luminosity functions of blue and red GC populations separately, we find
that the V-band turn-over of the blue GCs is generally brighter than that of
the red ones by about 0.3 mag, as expected if the two GC populations have
similar ages and mass distributions but different metallicities. Brighter than
M_V ~ -7.5, the luminosity functions (LFs) are well approximated by power-laws

clusters, suggesting that young and old globular clusters form by the same

spectral model, we find that the overall hardness of the spectra increase with
increasing spin-down rate, and therefore the spectral and spin-down mechanism
are inextricably linked in these objects. In terms of the two-component

increasing hardness of the high energy component with increasing spin-down
rate, with the temperature of the low energy blackbody component remaining
essentially constant. Also for the two component spectral model: the ratio of

Maxima-1 data. While all models produce acceptable fits as far as the power
spectrum is concerned, their corresponding polarization spectra differ widely.
The strongest differences are expected for a model with delayed recombination,
reflecting the fact that polarization measurements are most sensitive to the
processes governing the epoch of recombination.

transients (SXTs), of which a dozen have now been identified, had challenged
accepted wisdom in black hole evolution. The sheer number of inferred SXTs
requires that many, if not most, stars of ZAMS masses $20-35\msun$ end up as
black holes (Portegies Zwart et al. 1997; Ergma & van den Heuvel 1998). In this
paper we show that this can be understood by challenging the accepted wisdom
that the result of helium core burning in a massive star is independent of
whether the core is covered by a hydrogen envelope, or ""naked"" while it burns.
The latter case occurs in binaries when the envelope of the more massive star
is transferred to the companion by Roche Lobe overflow while in either main
sequence or red giant stage. For solar metallicity, whereas the helium cores
which burn while naked essentially never go into high-mass black holes, those
that burn while clothed do so, beginning at ZAMS mass $\sim 20\msun$, the
precise mass depending on the $^{12}C(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}$O rate as we outline.
In this way the SXTs can be evolved, provided that the H envelope of the
massive star is removed only following the He core burning. We also show that
in order to evolve a black hole of mass $\gsim 10\msun$ such as observed in Cyg
X-1, even employing extremely massive progenitors of ZAMS mass $\gsim 60\msun$
for the black hole, the core must be covered by hydrogen during a substantial
fraction of the core burning. In other words, the progenitor must be a WNL
star. We evolve Cyg X-1 in an analogous way to which the SXTs are evolved, the
difference being that the companion in Cyg X-1 is more massive than those in
the SXTs, so that Cyg X-1 shines continuously.

for the lack of well-developed inertial ranges in the simulations due to the

the fields while preserving the spatial structures. We find that the density
and velocity are moderately correlated in space and prove that the analytical
results by Lazarian and Pogosyan hold in the case when these fields obey the
fluid conservation equations. Our results imply that the spectra of velocity
and density can be safely recovered from the position-position-velocity (PPV)
data cubes available through observations, and confirm that the relative
contributions of the velocity and density fluctuations to those of the
emissivity depend on the velocity resolution used and on the steepness of the
density spectral index. Furthermore, this paper supports previous reports that
an interpretation of the features in the PPV data cubes as simple density
enhancements (i.e., ``clouds'') can be often erroneous, as we observe that
changes in the velocity statistics substantially modify the statistics of
emissivity within the velocity data cubes.

Systematic reddening of B-V, V-K colors towards the center, such as that
observed in the Cartwheel, can be obtained only if the abundance of heavy
elements in the star-forming gas is a few times below solar. The B-V and V-K

mixing of stellar populations born in a star-forming wave propagating through a

Furthermore it can be modified by the motion of the pedestrians. Therefore the
model uses an idea similar to chemotaxis, but with pedestrians following a

particular competitor y_i. We also generalize RCD so each x_i beats or ties all
possible competitors.
  Alas, this more realistic version of learning has no polynomial algorithm
unless P=NP! Indeed, not even generation does. So one cannot improve
qualitatively upon brute force:
  Merely checking that a single (given) ranking is consistent with given forms
is coNP-complete if the surface forms are fully observed and Delta_2^p-complete
if not. Indeed, OT generation is OptP-complete. As for ranking, determining
whether any consistent ranking exists is coNP-hard (but in Delta_2^p) if the
forms are fully observed, and Sigma_2^p-complete if not.

theories: in P, and NP-complete.

on these parameters using a combination of analytical and numerical methods.
Interesting limiting cases are the Maclaurin disk in the Newtonian limit, the
static limit which gives a solution of the Morgan and Morgan class and the
limit of a disk without counter-rotation. We study the mass and the angular
momentum of the spacetime. At the disk we discuss the energy-momentum tensor,

disk. The solutions have ergospheres in strongly relativistic situations. The
ultrarelativistic limit of the solution in which the central redshift diverges

the increasing theoretical and experimental difficulties encountered by this
model, which furthermore fails to be unitary. In particular, the conceptual
uneasiness generated by the excessive multiplicity of fundamental elements of
the Quark Model, 36 different quarks whose cohesion needs 8 different types of
gluons, has logically led some physicists to propose a variety of quark
substructures in an effort to reach unity. In order to avoid the forward escape
corresponding to the attribution of a substructure to quarks and to stand away
from the conceptual strangling to which the Standard model has led, we have
instead opted for different fundamentals. These, in contrast to those of the
Standard Model, are extremely simple and based on the assumption of a single
fundamental corpuscle, of dual manifestation as corpuscle and anticorpuscle, to
which is always associated an orbital that determines the structure of
particles. In such a frame particles differentiate through the diversity of
quantum states of their structuring orbital, in contrast to the strategy used
by the Standard Model based instead on the particle's multiplicity of
composition through the variety of the quark's content, furthermore limited to
hadrons. Instead the orbital conception of particles is unitary, unifying all
of them as well as their interactions. As an outstanding feature, nuclear
forces derive from the neutron orbital structure, based on a proton core and a
shell. This shell constitutes the cohesive element of nuclear structure.

space-time with negative cosmological constant, there are essentially two kinds
of higher-dimensional cousins which not only take an analytic form but also are

cousin is a trivial extension of five-dimensional model, while the other one is
in essence in higher dimensions. One interesting observation is that in the
latter model, only anti-de Sitter ($AdS_p$) brane is physically meaningful
whereas de Sitter ($dS_p$) and Minkowski ($M_p$) branes are dismissed.
Moreover, for $AdS_p$ brane in the latter model, we study the property of
localization of various bulk fields on a single brane. In particular, it is
shown that the presence of the brane cosmological constant enables bulk gauge
field and massless fermions to confine to the brane only by a gravitational

the algorithm required the systematic enumeration of all discs which support a
`braid foliation' and are embeddable in 3-space. The boundaries of these
`foliated embeddable discs' (FED's) are the collection of all closed braid
representatives of the unknot, up to conjugacy, and the second part of the
algorithm produces a word in the generators of the braid group which represents
the boundary of the previously listed FED's. The third part tests whether a
given closed braid is conjugate to the boundary of a FED on the list. In this
paper we describe implementations of the first and second parts of the
algorithm. We also give some of the data which we obtained. The data suggest
that FED's have unexplored and interesting structure. Open questions are

a maximum of the zero-field density-normalized mobility $\mu_{0}N$ has been
observed at the same density where it was detected in liquid Argon under
saturated vapor pressure conditions. The existence of the $\mu_{0}N$ maximum in
the liquid is commonly attributed to electrons scattering off long-wavelength
collective modes of the fluid, while for the low-density gas a density-modified
kinetic model is valid. The presence of the $\mu_{0}N$ maximum also in the gas
phase raises therefore the question whether the single scattering picture valid
in the gas is valid even at liquid densities.

  gradient","23 pages, 15 JPEG figures",,,"TCE-001-02-2001","physics.flu-dyn",,"  The axisymmetric deformation and motion of interacting droplets in an imposed
temperature gradient is considered using boundary-integral techniques for slow
viscous motion. Results showing temporal drop motion, deformations and
separation are presented for equal-viscosity fluids. The focus is on cases when
the drops are of equal radii or when the smaller drop trails behind the larger
drop. For equal-size drops, our analysis shows that the motion of a leading
drop is retarded while the motion of the trailing one is enchanced compared to
the undeformable case. The distance between the centers of equal-sized
deformable drops decreases with time. When a small drop follows a large one,
two patterns of behavior may exist. For moderate or large initial separation
the drops separate. However, if the initial separation is small there is a
transient period in which the separation distance initially decreases and only
afterwards the drops separate. This behavior stems from the multiple time
scales that exist in the system.

  force in the 4-dimensional space-time","LaTex2e, 5 pages, 1 figure, reuse version 4, revised",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  In this paper, we point out that the 4-vector force acting on a particle is
always in the direction orthogonal to the 4-vector velocity of the particle in
the 4-dimensional space-time, rather than along the line joining the particle
and the action source. This inference is obviously supported from the fact that
the magnitude of the 4-vector velocity is a constant. This orthogonality brings
out many new aspects for force concept. In this paper it is found that the
Maxwell's equations can be derived from classical Coulomb's force and the
orthogonality, some gravitational effects such as the perihelion advance of
planet can also be explained in terms of the orthogonality.

computing, principally developed by Bennet [IBM J. Res. Develop., 17(1973)] and
by Fredkin and Toffoli [Internat. J. Theoret. Phys., 21(1982)], to the quantum
case. This is a fundamental step towards the construction of a quantum computer
because a time efficient quantum computation is a reversible physical process.
The paper is organized as follows. The first section reviews the classical
theory of reversible computing. In the second section it is showed that the
designs used in the classical framework to decrease the consumption of space
cannot be generalized to the quantum case; it is also suggested that quantum
computing is generally more demanding of space than classical computing. In the
last section a new model of fully quantum and reversible automaton is proposed.
The computational power of this automaton is at least equal to that of
classical automata. Some conclusion are drawn in the last section.

the quantum domain retaining classical descriptions. Quantum Kolmogorov
complexity coincides with the classical Kolmogorov complexity on the classical
domain. Quantum Kolmogorov complexity is upper bounded and can be effectively
approximated from above under certain conditions. With high probability a
quantum object is incompressible. Upper- and lower bounds of the quantum
complexity of multiple copies of individual pure quantum states are derived and
may shed some light on the no-cloning properties of quantum states. In the
quantum situation complexity is not sub-additive. We discuss some relations
with ``no-cloning'' and ``approximate cloning'' properties.
