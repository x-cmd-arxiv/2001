suggest, either individually or in combination, that the Universe is close to
flat, i.e. that the curvature radius is about as large as the horizon radius
(\sim 10h^{-1}Gpc) or larger. Here, a method of distinguishing an almost flat
universe from a precisely flat universe using a single observational data set,
without using any microwave background information, is presented. The method
(i) assumes that a standard ruler should have no preferred orientation (radial
versus tangential) to the observer, and (ii) requires that the (comoving)
length of the standard ruler be known independently (e.g. from low redshift
estimates). The claimed feature at fixed {\em comoving} length in the power
spectrum of density perturbations, detected among quasars, Lyman break galaxies
or other high redshift objects, would provide an adequate standard candle to
prove that the Universe is curved, if indeed it is curved. For example, a
combined intrinsic and measurement uncertainty of 1% in the length of the
standard ruler $\llss$ applied at a redshift of $z=3$ would distinguish an
hyperbolic $(\Omega_m=0.2,\Omega_\Lambda=0.7)$ or a spherical
$(\Omega_m=0.4,\Omega_\Lambda=0.7)$ universe from a flat one to 1-P > 95%

source XTE J1819-254 (Markwardt et al. 1999), and afterwards identified with
the variable object V4641 Sgr (Kato et al. 1999). It underwent a bright optical
outburst on 1999 Sept. 15.7 UT, going from magnitude 14 to 8.8 in the V-band
(Stubbings 1999), and reaching 12.2 Crab in the X-rays (Smith et al. 1999) and
Ks nearly 13. This outburst was therefore bright, but very brief, with an
e-fold decay time of 0.6 days. A radio source was resolved, making of V4641 Sgr
a new microquasar (Hjellming et al. 2000). We discuss the nature of this
system, showing that our observations suggest a distance farther than
previously derived from the radio observations (Hjellming et al. 2000). The
distance of the system would be between 3 and 8 kpc, the companion star being a
B3-A2 main sequence star. Another possibility is that the companion star is
crossing the Hertzsprung gap (type B3-A2 IV), and in this case the distance
cited above would be the minimum distance of the system. The system is
therefore an Intermediate or High Mass X-ray Binary System (IMXB or HMXB). The
inconsistency regarding the distance between the radio and optical/NIR
observations could be explained by the detection of an interaction between
matter ejected before the X-ray outburst and the surrounding medium of the
source. If this is confirmed, this source could be added to the short list of
microquasars where such an interaction has been detected.

its weak X-ray emission suggests that it is much less massive than A2199. The
absence of a sharp peak in the infall pattern at the position of A2197 supports
this hypothesis. The outermost group is well outside the virial region of A2199

direct support of hierarchical structure formation; studies of these systems

gravity, focusing on the neutrino as the gravity-inducing particle. The
mechanism is based on the primacy of momentum conservation and postulates an
omni-directional distribution throughout the universe of fast small particles
of finite mass that have a low probability of colliding with nucleons. The
measured acceleration between two neighboring mass bodies results from an
alteration of this distribution caused by nucleons of each body interacting
with some of those particles. Based on findings establishing that the neutrino
has mass, we evaluate the various neutrinos as external particle candidates. We
show that for mass quantities up to several times that of the sun the form of
the time rate of momentum transfer to each body is proportional to the product
of the two body masses because of the probability nature of any collision
process, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
because of the mathematical properties of an altered particle flux. A derived
expression involving the neutrino momentum flux, the neutrino-nucleon collision
cross section, and the nucleon mass replaces the constant G from the classical
gravitational model. The neutrino momentum flux that is required to account for
gravity is so large as to cause us herein to re-evaluate conventional notions
in kinematics and the cause of inertial properties and to examine
neutrino-nucleon collisions as a possible source of electromagnetic standing
waves essential to establish electron shell states. This reasoning indicates
that in a much more massive body that is accreting mass, a coulombic collapse
to a black hole will ensue when external neutrinos lose the ability to
penetrate in sufficient numbers to the central region.

there is no strong tidal interaction. The outer more spherical structure is
formed from the early asymptotic giant branch (AGB) wind. Toward the end of the
AGB the mass loss rate increases, and wind velocity possibly decreases, making
the conditions for the formation of an accretion disk around the wide
companion, more favorable. We assume that the accreting companion blows jets or
a collimated fast wind (CFW), which lead to the formation of a pair of lobes in
the inner region. In cases of a precessing accretion disk, a multi-lobes
structure can be formed. We conduct a population synthesis study of such

to sample the radio behavior of XTE J1550-564 in the X-ray Low Hard and
Intermediate/Very High states. We observed optically thin radio emission from
XTE J1550-564 five days after a transition to an Intermediate/Very High state,
but we observed no radio emission six days later, while XTE J1550-564 was still
in the Intermediate/Very High state. In the Low Hard state, XTE J1550-564 is
detected with an inverted radio spectrum. The radio emission in the Low Hard
state most likely originates from a compact jet; optical observations suggest
that the synchrotron emission from this jet may extend up to the optical range.
The total power of the compact jet might therefore be a significant fraction of
the total luminosity of the system. We suggest that the optically thin
synchrotron radio emission detected five days after the transition to the
Intermediate/Very High state is due to a discrete ejection of relativistic
plasma during the state transition. Subsequent to the decay of the optically
thin radio emission associated with the state transition, it seems that in the
Intermediate/Very High state the radio emission is quenched by a factor greater
than 50, implying a suppression of the outflow. We discuss the properties of
radio emission in the X-ray states of BHCs.

are produced by jets of highly relativistic cannonballs (CBs), emitted in
supernova explosions. The fully ionized CBs cool to a temperature below 4500 K
within a day or two, at which point electron-proton recombination produces an
intense Lyman-$\alpha$ emission. The line energy is Doppler-shifted by the CBs'
motion to X-ray energies in the observer's frame. The measured line energies,
corrected for their cosmological redshift, imply Doppler factors in the range
600 to 1000, consistent with those estimated -in the CB model- from the
characteristics of the $\gamma$-ray bursts. All other observed properties of
the lines are also well described by the CB model. Scattering and
self-absorption of the recombination lines within the CB also produce a
wide-band flare-up in the GRB afterglow, as the observations indicate. A very
specific prediction of the CB model is that the X-ray lines ought to be narrow
and move towards lower line energies as they are observed: their current
apparently large widths would be the effect of time integration, and/or of the
blending of lines from CBs with different Doppler factors.

works very well). There are some novel behavior of scattering phase shifts at

shown to be non-universal, depending on the strength of the Coulomb

variational energy for chains of increasing size $2^4<N<2^{15}$. The
electrostatic blob picture, expected for small enough values of the interaction
strength, is quantitatively described by the variational approach. We perform a
Monte Carlo simulation for chains of length $2^4<N<2^{10}$. The non universal

stripe phase in doped cuprates, is simulated by means of the
density-matrix-renormalization-group method. String collides with adjacent
neighbors, as it wonders, owing to quantum zero-point fluctuations. The energy
cost due to the collisions is our main concern. Embedding a quantum string
between rigid walls with separation d, we found that for sufficiently large d,
collision-induced energy cost obeys the formula \sim exp (- A d^alpha) with
alpha=0.808(1), and string's mean fluctuation width grows logarithmically \sim
log d. Those results are not understood in terms of conventional picture that
the string is `disordered,' and only the short-wave-length fluctuations
contribute to collisions. Rather, our results support a recent proposal that
owing to collisions, short-wave-length fluctuations are suppressed, but
instead, long-wave-length fluctuations become significant. This mechanism would
be responsible for stabilizing the stripe phase.

of pure nearest neighbour hopping type, i.e. do not contain on-site
contributions. Previous analyses based on the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar
(DMPK) transfer matrix technique have shown that both spectral and transport
properties of quasi one-dimensional systems belonging to this category are
highly unusual. Notably, regimes with absence of exponential Anderson
localization are observed, the single particle density of states exhibits
singular structure in the vicinity of the band centre, and the manifestation of
these phenomena depends in an apparently topological manner on the even- or
oddness of the channel number. In this paper we re-consider the problem from
the complementary perspective of the non-linear sigma-model. Relying on the
standard analogy between one-dimensional statistical field theories and
zero-dimensional quantum mechanics, we will relate the problem to the behaviour
of a quantum point particle subject to an Aharonov-Bohm flux. We will re-derive
previous DMPK results, identify a new class of even/odd staggering phenomena
and trace back the anomalous behaviour of the bond disordered system to a
simple physical mechanism, viz. the flux periodicity of the quantum
Aharonov-Bohm system. We will also touch upon connections to the low energy
physics of other lattice systems, notably disordered chiral systems in 0 and 2
dimensions and antiferromagnetic spin chains.

properties of $\beta$--casein monolayers spread at the air-buffer interface,
and analysed these results in the context of models of weak polyampholytes.
Measurements have been made systematically over a wide range of ionic strength
and pH. In the semi-dilute regime of surface concentration a scaling exponent,
which can be linked to the degree of chain swelling, is found. This shows that
at pH close to the isoelectric point, the protein is compact. At pH away from
the isoelectric pH the protein is extended. The transition between compact and
extended states is continuous. As a function of increasing ionic strength, we
observe swelling of the protein at the isoelectric pH but contraction of the
protein at pH values away from it. These behaviours are typical of a those
predicted theoretically for a weak polyampholyte. Dilational moduli
measurements, made as a function of surface concentration exhibit maxima that
are linked to the collapse of hydrophilic regions of the protein into the
subphase. Based on this data we present a configuration map of the protein
configuration in the monolayer. These findings are supported by strain (surface
pressure) relaxation measurements and surface quasi-elastic light scattering
(SQELS) measurements which suggest the existence of loops and tails in the
subphase at higher surface concentrations.

suffer from suppression due to Sudakov factors, in the region where the
transverse momentum is much smaller than the large energy scale Q^2. The size
and Q^2 dependence of this suppression are studied numerically for two such
asymmetries, both arising due to the Collins effect. General features are
discussed of how the fall-off with Q^2 is affected by the nonperturbative
Sudakov factor and by the transverse momentum weights and angular dependences
that appear in different asymmetries. For a subset of asymmetries the
asymptotic Q^2 behavior is calculated analytically, providing an upper bound
for the decrease with energy of other asymmetries. The effect of Sudakov
factors on the transverse momentum distributions is found to be very
significant already at present-day collider energies. Therefore, it is
essential to take into account Sudakov factors in transverse momentum dependent
azimuthal spin asymmetries.

purpose of this article is to introduce and study a new notion of algebra,
called ""associative dialgebra"", which is, to the Leibniz algebras, what
associative algebras are to Lie algebras. An associative dialgebra is a vector
space equipped with two associative operations satisfying three more
conditions. For instance, any differential associative algebra gives rise to a
dialgebra.
  In this article we construct and study a (co)homology theory for associative
dialgebras. The surprizing fact, in the construction of the chain complex, is
the appearance of the combinatorics of planar binary trees (grafting and
nesting). The principal result about this homology theory is its vanishing on
free associative dialgebras.
  The Koszul dual (in the sense of Ginzburg and Kapranov) of the operad of
associative dialgebras is the operad of ""dendriform algebras"". The dendriform
algebras are characterized by two operations satisfying three linear
conditions. The sum of these two operations defines a new operation which is
associative. The free dendriform algebra can be described in terms of planar
binary trees. As a consequence we give an explicitly description of strong
homotopy associative dialgebras.

periodicity phenomenons in algebraic K-theory, as explained in ``Overview on
Leibniz algebras, dialgebras and their homology"". Fields Inst. Commun. 17

unpredictable evolution in spatially extended deterministic dynamical systems
even in the presence of a fully negative spectrum of Lyapunov exponents. This
regime, denoted as ``stable chaos'', has been so far mainly characterized by
numerical studies. In this manuscript we investigate the mechanisms that are at
the basis of this form of unpredictable evolution generated by a nonlinear
information flow through the boundaries. In order to clarify how linear
stability can coexist with nonlinear instability, we construct a suitable
stochastic model. In the absence of spatial coupling, the model does not reveal
the existence of any self-sustained chaotic phase. Nevertheless, already this
simple regime reveals peculiar differences between the behaviour of finite-size
and that of infinitesimal perturbations. A mean-field analysis of the truly
spatially extended case clarifies that the onset of chaotic behaviour can be
traced back to the diffusion process that tends to shift the growth rate of
finite perturbations from the quenched to the annealed average. The possible
characterization of the transition as the onset of directed percolation is also
briefly discussed as well as the connections with a synchronization transition.
