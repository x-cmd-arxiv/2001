low surface brightness than in previous surveys. We calculated their distances
according to Van de Steene & Zijlstra (1995). We find that most of the new

than the previously known bulge PNe. Based on H-alpha images and spectroscopic

of the extinction values around the galactic center rises toward the center, as

galaxy in an early stage of evolution. Here we present observations of the
luminous emission line halo and the stellar components of this radio galaxy.
Optical narrow band imaging shows a very extended (about 160 kpc) and luminous
Lyman alpha halo. Infrared narrow band imaging reveals a much smaller H alpha
halo with a very different morphology. We advocate a model in which the inner
part of the halo is photoionized by direct AGN illumination or by UV photons
from young stars. Far from the nucleus (about 25 kpc), there is a region of
greatly enhanced Lyman alpha emission. At this location, it is likely that
shock ionization is important as indicated by a bend in the radio jet.
Spectroscopy of several continuum clumps in the halo shows that, although there
are striking differences between the emission and absorption features of the
spectra of various regions, they have properties similar to those of
Lyman-break galaxies. This is further evidence for a scenario in which massive
galaxies form hierarchically from smaller building blocks.

gradient has been observed in laboratory experiments and has been proposed as a
mechanism for mixing molecular weight in late stages of stellar evolution in
regions which are unstable to semiconvection. It is not yet known whether such
layers can exist in a very low viscosity fluid: this work undertakes to address
that question. Layering is simulated numerically both at high Prandtl number
(relevant to the laboratory) in order to describe the onset of layering
intability, and the astrophysically important case of low Prandtl number. It is
argued that the critical stability parameter for interfaces between layers, the
Richardson number, increases with decreasing Prandtl number. Throughout the
simulations the fluid has a tendency to form large scale flows in the first
convecting layer, but only at low Prandtl number do such structures have
dramatic consequences for layering. These flows are shown to drive large
interfacial waves whose breaking contributes to significant mixing across the
interface. An effective diffusion coefficient is determined from the simulation
and is shown to be much greater than the predictions of both an enhanced
diffusion model and one which specifically incorporates wave breaking. The
results further suggest that molecular weight gradient interfaces are
ineffective barriers to mixing even when specified as initial conditions, such
as would arise when a compositional gradient is redistributed by another
mechanism than buoyancy, such as rotation or internal waves.

properties of the dark matter have been proposed. We show that general
principles of quantum mechanics, in particular unitarity, imply interesting
constraints on two proposals: collisional dark matter proposed by Spergel &
Steinhardt, and strongly annihilating dark matter proposed by Kaplinghat, Knox
& Turner. Efficient scattering required in both implies m < 12 GeV and m < 25
GeV respectively. The same arguments show that the strong annihilation in the
second scenario implies the presence of significant elastic scattering,
particularly for large enough masses. Recently, a variant of the collisional
scenario has been advocated to satisfy simultaneously constraints from dwarf
galaxies to clusters, with a cross section that scales inversely with velocity.
We show that this scenario likely involves super-elastic processes, and the
associated kinetic energy change must be taken into account when making
predictions. Exceptions and implications for experimental searches are
discussed.

correlated with the column density of HI in the field. Assuming a Galactic

ellipticals with a predominantly old coeval stellar population. However, there
is another, unexpected, category of HDF early-type galaxies, in which the
galaxy core is significantly bluer than the outer regions. We demonstrate that
these colour gradients are predicted by the multi-zone chemodynamical model for
the evolution of elliptical galaxies. We suggest that the colour gradient could
be used as a chronometer of the evolution of elliptical galaxies: galaxies
younger than a few Gyr exhibit cores bluer than the surrounding galaxy, due to
ongoing star formation, while more evolved galaxies have redder cores, due to
metallicity gradients increasing towards the centre.

focused on comparing the capabilities of the two most sensitive missions

conclude that, if the GRB rate is proportional to the star formation rate, the
capabilities of studying GRBs of INTEGRAL are complementary to the ones of
missions like Swift and HETE-2, specially devoted to prompt localizations of
GRBs. Whereas Swift and HETE-2 would detect a higher number of GRBs than
INTEGRAL (~8 and ~22 more detections than IBIS and JEM-X respectively),
INTEGRAL and specially IBIS would detect very high redshift (z > 15) GRBs,
unreachable for Swift and HETE-2. This fact is very relevant for studying a
population of GRBs further than z=15, which would be associated with the
population III of stars. Therefore, the INTEGRAL mission (precisely IBIS) will
be a very valuable tool to trace the primitive star formation rate at the early
universe.

In the conservative regime (no radiation losses), the quantum model depends on
a single collective parameter, $\rho$, that can be interpreted as the average
number of photons scattered per atom in the classical limit. When $\rho\gg 1$,
the semiclassical CARL regime is recovered, with many momentum levels populated
at saturation. On the contrary, when $\rho\le 1$, the average momentum
oscillates between zero and $\hbar\vec q$, and a periodic train of $2\pi$
hyperbolic secant pulses is emitted. In the dissipative regime (large radiation
losses) and in a suitable quantum limit, a sequential superfluorescence
scattering occurs, in which after each process atoms emit a $\pi$ hyperbolic
secant pulse and populate a lower momentum state. These results describe the

(annual growth rates in real per capita GDP in the seventeen leading capitalist

over the business cycle do indeed follow power law like behaviour for a
significant proportion of the data (demonstrating the existence of cooperative
phenomena amongst economic agents). Crucially, however, there are systematic
deviations from this behaviour when one considers the frequency of occurrence
of large recessions. Under these circumstances the power law scaling breaks
down. It is argued that it is the adaptive behaviour of the agents (their
ability to recognise the changing economic environment) which modifies their

an expression for a quadratic shear viscous response coefficient using two
different formalisms: transport theory and response theory. The transport
theory calculation is carried out by assuming a local equilibrium form for the
distribution function and expanding in the gradient of the local four
dimensional velocity field. By doing a gradient expansion on the Boltzmann
equation we obtain a hierarchy of equations for the coefficients of this
expansion.To do the response theory calculation we use Zubrave's techniques in
nonequilibrium statistical mechanics to derive a generalized Kubo formula.
Using this formula allows us to obtain the quadratic shear viscous response
from the three-point retarded green function of the viscous shear stress
tensor. We use the closed time path formalism of real time finite temperature
field theoryto show that this three-point function can be calculated using
equilibrium quantum field theory by writing it as an integral equation
involving a four-point vertex. This four-point vertex can in turn be obtained
from an integral equation which represents the resummation of an infinite
series of ladder and extended-ladder diagrams.The connection between transport
theory and response theory is made when we show that the integral equation for
this four-point vertex has exactly the same form as the equation obtained from
the Boltzmann equation for the coefficient of the quadratic term of the
gradient expansion of the distribution function.

infrared domain leading thus to the enhancement of zero momentum modes in the

infrared singularities can be put under control. In this way a new phase in

adapted to allow for nonvanishing bosonic torsion. As the analysis of the
Bianchi identities reveals, a new vector superfield is encountered besides the
well-known scalar one. The constraints are solved both with superfields using a
special decomposition of the supervielbein, and explicitly in terms of
component fields in a Wess-Zumino gauge. The graded Poisson Sigma Model (gPSM)
is the alternative method used to construct supersymmetric gravity theories. In
this context the graded Jacobi identity is solved algebraically for general
cases. Some of the Poisson algebras obtained are singular, or several
potentials contained in them are restricted. This is discussed for a selection
of representative algebras. It is found, that the gPSM is far more flexible and
it shows the inherent ambiguity of the supersymmetric extension more clearly
than the superfield method. Among the various models spherically reduced
Einstein gravity and gravity with torsion are treated. Also the Legendre
transformation to eliminate auxiliary fields, superdilaton theories and the
explicit solution of the gPSM equations of motion for a typical model are
presented. Furthermore, the PSM field equations are analyzed in detail, leading
to the so called ""symplectic extension"". Thereby, the Poisson tensor is
extended to become regular by adding new coordinates to the target space. For
gravity models this is achieved with one additional coordinate. Finally, the
relation of the gPSM to the superfield method is established by extending the
base manifold to become a supermanifold.

by holomorphic line bundles of degree g-1, and for the case g=0 - by smooth
closed Jordan curves on the complex plane. In both cases we define a notion of
tau-function as a partition function of the theory and evaluate it explicitly.
For the case g > 0 the tau-function is an analytic torsion [3], and for the
case g=0 - the regularized energy of a certain natural pseudo-measure on the
interior domain of a closed curve. For these cases we rigorously prove the Ward
identities for the current correlation functions and determine them explicitly.
For the case g > 0 these functions coincide with those obtained in [21,36]
using bosonization. For the case g=0 the tau-function we have defined coincides
with the tau-function introduced in [29,44,24] as a dispersionless limit of the
Sato's tau-function for the two-dimensional Toda hierarchy. As a corollary of
the Ward identities, we obtain recent results [44,24] on relations between
conformal maps of exterior domains and tau-functions. For this case we also
define a Hermitian metric on the space of all contours of given area. As
another corollary of the Ward identities we prove that the introduced metric is
Kahler and the logarithm of the tau-function is its Kahler potential.

how small the number of samples in the ensemble. The exact statistical
equations can be used to verify DNS computations and to detect their
limitations. For example,if DNS data are used to evaluate the exact statistical
equations, then the equations should balance to within numerical precision,
otherwise a computational problem is indicated. The equations allow
quantification of the approach to local homogeneity and to local isotropy.
Testing the balance of the equations allows detection of scaling ranges for
quantification of scaling-range exponents. The second-order equations lead to
Kolmogorov's equation. All higher-order equations contain a statistic composed
of one factor of the two-point difference of the pressure gradient multiplied
by factors of velocity difference. Investigation of this

whether or not different components of the velocity structure function of given
order have differing exponents in the inertial range, and 2) the increasing
deviation of those exponents from Kolmogorov scaling as the order increases.

metastable helium atoms. Our method directly samples the reconstruction of a
thermal energy distribution after the application of an RF knife. The
relaxation time of our sample towards equilibrium gives an elastic collision
rate constant close to the unitarity limit.

Rev. A63, 032304 (2001)] to investigate three types of nonlinear qubit
transformations using measurement and quantum based schemes. Firstly, nonlinear
rotations are studied. We rotate different parts of a Bloch sphere in opposite
directions about the z-axis. The second transformation is a map which sends a
qubit to its orthogonal state (which we define as ORTHOG). We consider the case
when the ORTHOG is applied to only a partial area of a Bloch sphere. We also
study nonlinear general transformation, i.e. (theta,phi)->(theta-alpha,phi),
again, applied only to part of the Bloch sphere. In order to achieve these
three operations, we consider different measurement preparations and derive the
optimal average (instead of universal) quantum unitary transformations. We also
introduce a simple method for a qubit measurement and its application to other
cases.

concept the quantum description and the classical one must be the levels for
investigation of some world solution of the unified field model. It is shown
that in the framework of the unified local field theory there are nonlocal
correlations between space separate events. Thus the experiments of Aspect type
for testing of the Bell inequalities and for showing of the nonlocal
correlations do not reject a possibility for description of matter with the
unified local field theory. Advantages of such theory for new technologies are
considered.

microstates of the Schr\""{o}dinger equation are reviewed and contrasted with
the Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics. The kinematic equation of
Floydian trajectories is analysed in detail and a new definition of the
variational derivative of kinetic energy with respect to total energy is
proposed for which Floydian trajectories have an explicit time dependence with
a frequency equal to the beat frequency between adjacent pairs of energy
eigenstates in the case of bound systems. In the case of unbound systems,
Floydian and Bohmian trajectories are found to be related by a local
transformation of time which is determined by the quantum potential.

state evolution and weak objectivity. In this comment it is shown that this
choice is forced on us by an inconsistent pseudo-realistic interpretation of
quantum states. A strongly objective one-world interpretation of linear quantum
mechanics is presented. It is argued that the weak objectivity favored by
d'Espagnat is, in fact, inconsistent with quantum mechanics.
