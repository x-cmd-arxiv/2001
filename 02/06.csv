density is at least 10^13 cm^-3, 20 times the mean wind, and the temperature is
roughly 10,000 K, about 20% cooler than the mean wind. The clumps leading to
the largest observed polarization must have electron optical depth of 0.1 - 1
and an angular extent of 0.1 - 1 ster, and account for at most 2% of the wind
mass loss. The H and HeI emission lines from the wind are unpolarized, but
their P Cygni absorption is enhanced by a factor of 4 in the scattered light.

Accretion in clusters is a dynamic phenomenon as both the stars and the gas
respond to the same gravitational potential. Accretion rates are highly
non-uniform with stars nearer the centre of the cluster, where gas densities
are higher, accreting more than others. This competitive accretion naturally
results in both initial mass segregation and a spectrum of stellar masses.
Accretion in gas-dominated clusters is well modelled using a tidal-lobe radius
instead of the commonly used Bondi-Hoyle accretion radius. This works as both
the stellar and gas velocities are under the influence of the same
gravitational potential and are thus comparable. The low relative velocity that
results means that the tidal radius is smaller than the Bondi-Hoyle radius in
these systems. In contrast, when the stars dominate the potential and are
virialised, the Bondi-Hoyle radius is smaller than the tidal radius and thus
Bondi-Hoyle accretion is a better fit to the accretion rates.

as seen during outburst and with photometric minimum when the pulsar is behind
the companion. The lack of a double-humped morphology rules out an ellipsoidal
origin, implying that the bulk of the optical flux does not arise from the
companion. Moreover, applying crude modelling to the disc and X-ray irradiated
face of the donor shows that the internal energy release of a remnant disc

most of the optical emission, and with the modulation due to the varying

consistent with the much lower X-ray to optical flux ratio in quiescence versus

the summed distribution of the entire globular cluster population closely

there is a deficit of bright clusters within the central regions of dEs
(excluding the nuclei), perhaps due to the orbital decay of these massive
clusters into the dE cores. We also predict the magnitude of each dE's nucleus
assuming the nuclei form via dynamical friction. The observed trend of
decreasing nuclear luminosity with decreasing dE luminosity is much stronger
than predicted if the nuclei formed via simple dynamical friction processes. We
find that the bright dE nuclei could have been formed from the merger of
orbitally decayed massive clusters, but the faint nuclei are several magnitudes
fainter than expected. These faint nuclei are found primarily in M_V > -14 dEs
which have high globular cluster specific frequencies and extended globular

on the structure of the lensing potential. The simplest is the magnification
invariant, which is the sum of the signed magnifications of the images. Higher
order invariants are the sums of products of the signed magnifications with

consider the case of the four and five image systems produced by elliptical

all their lensing invariants. For practical evaluation, this offers
considerable advantages over the algebraic methods used previously. To
illustrate the power of the contour integral method, we calculate full

The previous treatment was done in order to optimise the detection of long
timescale variations (larger than a few days) and we further optimise our
analysis for the selection of Long Timescale and Long Period Variables
(LT&LPV). We choose to perform a selection of variable objects as comprehensive
as possible, independent of periodicity and of their position on the colour
magnitude diagram. We detail the different thresholds successively applied to
the light curves, which allow to produce a catalogue of 632 variable objects.
We present a table with the coordinate of each variable, its EROS magnitudes at
one epoch and an indicator of blending in both colours, together with a finding
chart.
  A cross-correlation with various catalogues shows that 90% of those variable
objects were undetected before, thus enlarging the sample of LT&LPV previously
known in this area by a factor of 10. Due to the limitations of both the Pixel
Method and the data set, additional data -- namely a longer baseline and near
infrared photometry -- are required to further characterise these variable
stars, as will be addressed in subsequent papers.

which is based on color measurements carried out homogeneously within an

giant early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster, with CCD observations in the U-

gradients in early-type galaxies cannot be neglected when discussing the colors
of these systems, and that the CM relation derived using color measurements
within the effective radius is significantly flatter than those based on

by studies of both time-averaged spectra and variability patterns. While the
former has been explored extensively, the latter is in its infancy. In this
paper, we study the production of short-term flares in the shock-in-jet model.
We examine how the flares' profiles depend on such parameters as
shock/dissipation lifetime, electron-injection time profile, adiabaticity, and
half-opening angle of the jet. In particular, we demonstrate the large
difference between flare profiles produced in the radiative and adiabatic
regimes. We apply our model to the $\sim$day timescale flares observed in
optically violently variable (OVV) quasars, checking whether the
external-radiation-Compton (ERC) model for $\gamma$-ray flares at energies $>
30$ MeV (EGRET range) can be reconciled with the flares observed at lower
energies. Specifically, we show that the strict correlation between X-ray and
$\gamma$-ray flares strongly supports the dominance of the synchrotron
self-Compton mechanism in the X-ray band. We also derive conditions that must
be satisfied by the ERC model in order to explain a lag of the $\gamma$-ray
peak behind the optical one, as claimed to be observed in PKS 1406-076.
Finally, we predict that in ERC models where the MeV peak is related to the
break in electron distribution due to inefficient cooling of electrons below a
certain energy, the flares should decay significantly more slowly in the soft
$\gamma$-ray band than at energies greater than 30 MeV.

Radiative transfer calculations have been carried out to model the spectral

visibility functions. The observed dust shell properties do not appear to be in
accordance with single-shell models but seem to require multiple components.
Considering previous periods of enhanced mass-loss, various density
enhancements in the dust shell were taken into account. An extensive grid of
models was calculated for different locations and strenghts of such superwind
regions in the dust shell. To match the observations from the optical to the
sub-mm domain requires at least two superwind regions embedded in the shell.
The best model includes a dust shell with a temperature of 1000K at its inner
radius of 6.2Rstar, a close embedded superwind shell extending from 15.5Rstar
to 21.7Rstar with amplitude 10 (factor of density enhancement), and a far-out
density enhancement at 186Rstar with amplitude 5. The angular diameter of the
inner dust-shell rim amounts to 105mas. Within the various parts of the dust
shell, 1/r^2 density distributions could be maintained differing only in their
amplitude A. The present-day mass-loss rate was determined to be 1.2 10^-4
Msol/yr. The inner embedded superwind shell corresponds to a phase of enhanced
mass-loss which began ~59yr ago and lasted for ~18yr, and the outer superwind
region to a high mass-loss period which terminated 529yr ago.

of `rejuvenation and memory' upon temperature changes. In this paper, we
propose microscopic mechanisms (at the scale of spin-spin interactions) which
can be at the origin of such phenomena. Firstly, we recall that, in a
frustrated system, the effective average interaction between two spins may take
different values (possibly with opposite signs) at different temperatures. We
give simple examples of such situations, which we compute exactly. Such
mechanisms can explain why new ordering processes (rejuvenation) seem to take
place in spin glasses when the temperature is lowered. Secondly, we emphasize
the fact that inhomogeneous interactions do naturally lead to a wide
distribution of relaxation times for thermally activated flips. `Memory spots'
spontaneously appear, in the sense that the flipping time of some spin clusters
becomes extremely long when the temperature is decreased. Such memory spots are
capable of keeping the memory of previous ordering at a higher temperature
while new ordering processes occur at a lower temperature. After a qualitative
discussion of these mechanisms, we show in the numerical simulation of a
simplified example that this may indeed work. Our conclusion is that certain
chaos-like phenomena may show up spontaneously in any frustrated and
inhomogeneous magnetic system, without impeding the occurrence of memory
effects.

is a polynomial in Q and v=a-1(a=e^-T) and the coefficients of this
polynomial,Phi(b,c), are the number of graphs on the lattice consisting of b
bonds and c connected clusters. We introduce the random-cluster transfer matrix
to compute Phi exactly on finite square lattices. Given the FK representation
of the partition function we begin by studying the critical Potts model
Z_{CP}=Z(Q,a_c), where a_c=1+sqrt{Q}. We find a set of zeros in the complex
w=sqrt{Q} plane that map to the Beraha numbers for real positive Q. We also
identify tilde{Q}_c(L), the value of Q for a lattice of width L above which the
locus of zeros in the complex p=v/sqrt{Q} plane lies on the unit circle. We
find that 1/tilde{Q}_c->0 as 1/L->0. We then study zeros of the AF Potts model
in the complex Q plane and determine Q_c(a), the largest value of Q for a fixed
value of a below which there is AF order. We find excellent agreement with
Q_c=(1-a)(a+3). We also investigate the locus of zeros of the FM Potts model in
the complex Q plane and confirm that Q_c=(a-1)^2. We show that the edge
singularity in the complex Q plane approaches Q_c as Q_c(L)~Q_c+AL^-y_q, and
determine the scaling exponent y_q. Finally, by finite size scaling of the
Fisher zeros near the AF critical point we determine the thermal exponent y_t

strings via WZWN models. In this note we discuss this relationship further and
point out its possible applications to cuprates and related materials. The
connection between quantum groups and strings is one way of seeing the validity
of our previous conjecture [i.e. that a theory for cuprates may be constructed
on the basis of quantum groups]. The cuprates seems to exhibit statistics,
dimensionality and phase transitions in novel ways. The nature of excitations
[i.e. quasiparticle or collective] must be understood. The Hubbard model
captures some of the behaviour of the phase transitions in these materials. On
the other hand the phases such as stripes in these materials bear relationship
to quantum group or string-like solutions. One thus expects that the relevant
solutions of Hubbard model may thus be written in terms of stringy solutions.
In short this approach may lead to the non-perturbative formualtion of Hubbard
and other condensed matter Hamiltonians. The question arises that how a 1-d
based symmetry such as quantum groups can be relevant in describing a 3-d
[spatial dimensions] system such as cuprates. The answer lies in the key
observation that strings which are 1-d objects can be used to describe physics
in $d$ dimensions. For example gravity [which is a 3-d [spatial] plus time]
phenomenon can be understood in terms of 1-d strings. Thus we expect that 1-d
quantum group object induces physics in 2-d and 3-d which may be relevant to
the cuprates.

is studied using exact numerical calculations. First we show that the
ferromagnetism, which exists for small system sizes, vanishes with a large
excitation at a random field strength dependent length scale. This {\it
break-up length scale} $L_b$ scales exponentially with the squared random
field, $\exp(A/\Delta^2)$. By adding an external field $H$ we then study the
susceptibility in the ground state. If $L>L_b$, domains melt continuously and
the magnetization has a smooth behavior, independent of system size, and the
susceptibility decays as $L^{-2}$. We define a random field strength dependent
critical external field value $\pm H_c(\Delta)$, for the up and down spins to
form a percolation type of spanning cluster. The percolation transition is in
the standard short-range correlated percolation universality class. The mass of
the spanning cluster increases with decreasing $\Delta$ and the critical
external field approaches zero for vanishing random field strength, implying
the critical field scaling (for Gaussian disorder) $H_c \sim (\Delta
-\Delta_c)^\delta$, where $\Delta_c = 1.65 \pm 0.05$ and $\delta=2.05\pm 0.10$.
Below $\Delta_c$ the systems should percolate even when H=0. This implies that
even for H=0 above $L_b$ the domains can be fractal at low random fields, such
that the largest domain spans the system at low random field strength values
and its mass has the fractal dimension of standard percolation $D_f = 91/48$.
The structure of the spanning clusters is studied by defining {\it red
clusters}, in analogy to the ``red sites'' of ordinary site-percolation. The
size of red clusters defines an extra length scale, independent of $L$.

assumed to generate uniformly fluctuating interaction matrix elements. We show
that the ground state magnetization is systematically decreased by off-diagonal
fluctuations of the interaction matrix elements. This effect is neglected in
the Stoner picture of itinerant ferromagnetism in which the ground-state
magnetization is simply determined by the balance between ferromagnetic
exchange and kinetic energy, and increasing the interaction strength always
favors ferromagnetism. The physical origin of the demagnetizing effect of
interaction fluctuations is the larger number of final states available for
interaction-induced scattering in the lower spin sectors of the Hilbert space.
We analyze the energetic role played by these fluctuations in the limits of
small and large interaction $U$. In the small $U$ limit we do second-order
perturbation theory and identify explicitly transitions which are allowed for
minimal spin and forbidden for higher spin. These transitions then on average
lower the energy of the minimal spin ground state with respect to higher spin.
For large interactions $U$ we amplify on our earlier work [Ph. Jacquod and A.D.
Stone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 3938 (2000)] which showed that minimal spin is
favored due to a larger broadening of the many-body density of states in the

do with an unrecognized form of order. The manifestation of this order is the
robust property that the charge stripes are at the same time anti-phase
boundaries in the spin system. We demonstrate that the quantity which is
ordering is sublattice parity, referring to the geometric property of a
bipartite lattice that it can be subdivided in two sublattices in two different
ways. Re-interpreting standard results of one dimensional physics, we
demonstrate that the same order is responsible for the phenomenon of
spin-charge separation in strongly interacting one dimensional electron
systems. In fact, the stripe phases can be seen from this perspective as the
precise generalization of the Luttinger liquid to higher dimensions. Most of
this paper is devoted to a detailed exposition of the mean-field theory of
sublattice parity order in 2+1 dimensions. Although the quantum-dynamics of the
spin- and charge degrees of freedom is fully taken into account, a perfect
sublattice parity order is imposed. Due to novel order-out-of-disorder physics,
the sublattice parity order gives rise to full stripe order at long wavelength.
This adds further credibility to the notion that stripes find their origin in
the microscopic quantum fluctuations and it suggests a novel viewpoint on the
relationship between stripes and high Tc superconductivity.

between the free energy dissipation rate and the size of the largest

origin of the departures from the simple pseudopotential result for the

contributions to the spectral weight. These arise from more complicated final
states of the many-body system than the ones usually considered. In particular,
we show how the relevant response function may be treated in a manner similar
to the density-density response function for Fermi liquids, and express it as a
coherent part coming from single particle-hole pairs, and an incoherent part
coming from other excitations. We argue that in experiments only the coherent

rotating Bertotti-Robinson (BR) Universe. It is supported by an homogeneous
Maxwell field and a linear axion and can be obtained as a near-horizon limit of
extremal rotating dilaton-axion black holes. It has the isometry $SL(2,R)\times
U(1)$ where U(1) is the remnant of the SO(3) symmetry of BR broken by rotation,
while $SL(2,R)$ corresponds to the $AdS_2$ sector which no longer factors out
of the full spacetime. Alternatively our solution can be obtained from the D=5
vacuum counterpart to the dyonic BR with equal electric and magnetic field
strengths. The derivation amounts to smearing it in D=6 and then reducing to
D=4 with dualization of one Kaluza-Klein two-form in D=5 to produce an axion.
Using a similar dualization procedure, the rotating BR solution is uplifted to
D=11 supergravity. We show that it breaks all supersymmetries of N=4
supergravity in D=4, and that its higher dimensional embeddings are not
supersymmetric either. But, hopefully it may provide a new arena for corformal
mechanics and holography. Applying a complex coordinate transformation we also
derive a BR solution endowed with a NUT parameter.

Maldacena conjecture and are within 10-15% of the predicted results. We present
a method for using a ``flavor'' symmetry to greatly reduce the size of the Fock
basis and discuss a numerical method that we use which is particularly well
suited for this type of matrix element calculation. Our results are still not
sufficient to demonstrate convergence, and, therefore, cannot be considered to
be a numerical proof of the conjecture. We update our continuous efforts to
improve on these results and present some results on the way to higher

decreases exponentially with a rate we compute explicitly.

laser resonator in the regime of single-mode lasing. Random spatial variations

modes changes qualitatively at the lasing transition, and displays up to three
peaks above the lasing threshold.

three qubit pure and mixed states. We use our result to prove that entanglement

algorithm. Despite its simplicity, the decoherence model is an instructive
model that can genuinely imitate realistic noisy environment in many
situations. As one would expect, as the size of the database gets larger, the
effects of decoherence on the efficiency of the quantum search algorithm cannot
be ignored. Moreover, with decoherence, it may not be useful to iterate beyond
the first maxima in the probability distribution of the search entry.
Surprisingly, we also find that the number of iterations for maximum
probability of the search entry reduces with decoherence.

class of nonlinear quantum maps and a single, local unitary operation. This
special class of nonlinear quantum maps is generated in a natural way by a
hermitian generalized XOR-gate. The proposed purification scheme offers two
major advantages, namely it does not require local depolarization operations at
each step of the purification procedure and it purifies more efficiently than
other know purification schemes.
