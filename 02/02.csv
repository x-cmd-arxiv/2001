statistical simulations which show that if the number of coincidences $\ge$ 10
the radio and $\gamma$-ray events are associated with each other at >99.999%

scattering by relativistic electrons in the parsec-scale regions of the jet
rather than closer to the central engine.

negligible (<1%) at very low latitudes (|b|<2 deg.) but increases continuously
towards higher |b| and becomes dominant near the highest density region of the

although the total error is likely to be larger (~0.1 dex) due to systematic
errors related to the effective temperature scale and to model atmospheres.
This metallicity is somewhat larger than both the mean abundance in the
galactic bulge found by McWilliam & Rich (1994) and that found in our previous
paper for NGC 6553. However, we find that the spectra of clump stars in NGC
6528 and NGC 6553 are very similar each other, the slightly different metal
abundances found being possibly due to the different atmospheric parameters
adopted in the two analyses. For NGC 6528 we find excesses for the
alpha-process elements Si and Ca ([Si/Fe]=+0.4 and [Ca/Fe]=+0.2), whereas Mn is
found to be underabundant ([Mn/Fe]=-0.4). We find a solar abundance of O;
however this is somewhat uncertain due to the dependence of the O abundance on
the adopted atmospheric parameters and to coupling between C and O abundances
in these cool, metal-rich stars. Finally, we find large Na excesses ([Na/Fe]~
+0.4) in all stars examined. Since the present analysis is based on higher

ATESP 1.4 GHz radio survey. The survey covers a region of ~26 sq. degrees at
decl. -40 degr. and has produced a catalogue of 2967 radio sources down to ~0.5
mJy (6sigma). In this paper we present the optical identifications over a 3 sq.
degr. region of the public ESO Imaging Survey. In this region deep photometry
and 95% complete object catalogues in the I band are available down to I~22.5.
These data allowed us to identify 57% of the ATESP sources present in the
region (219/386). For a magnitude limited sample of 70 identified sources with
I<19.0 we have obtained spectroscopy at the ESO 3.6 m telescope. This data
allowed us to get redshifts and spectral classification for all sources (except
one). From the analysis of the spectroscopic sample we find that the
composition of the faint radio population abruptly changes going from mJy to
sub-mJy fluxes: the early type galaxies largely dominate the mJy population
(60%), while star forming processes become important in the sub-mJy regime.
Starburst and post-starburst galaxies go from 13% at S>1 mJy to 39% at S<1 mJy.
Nevertheless, at sub-mJy fluxes, early type galaxies still constitute a
significant fraction (25%) of the whole population. We also show that, due to
the distribution of radio to optical ratios, sub-mJy samples with fainter
spectroscopic follow-ups should be increasingly sensitive to the population of
early type galaxies, while a larger fraction of star-forming galaxies would be
expected in microJy samples. We compare our results with others obtained from
studies of sub-mJy samples and we show how the existing discrepancies can be
explained in terms of selection effects.

using ASCA. It is shown that all sources in the survey are well-fitted by the
same two-component emission model that we have previously shown is able to
describe both the non-dip and dip spectra of the dipping class of LMXB. This
model consists of point-like blackbody emission from the neutron star plus
Comptonized emission from a disk-like accretion disk corona of radius typically
50,000 km. Additional data from results published elsewhere by us from BeppoSAX
and ASCA are added to the survey. The large variation in blackbody luminosity
of survey sources is shown to be due primarily to major changes in blackbody
emitting area. Fitting a multi-temperature disk blackbody plus Comptonization
model to the survey spectra requires values of inner disk radius substantially
less than the neutron star radius in many cases, making disk origin of the
blackbody highly unlikely. Assuming that the emission is from an equatorial
strip on the neutron star, it is shown that the half-height of the strip h
agrees well with the half-height H of the radiatively-supported inner accretion
disk, this agreement spanning three orders of magnitude in each parameter.
Possible mechanisms for the agreement are discussed, including radial accretion
flow between inner disk and star, and accretion flow ``creep' on the surface of
the neutron star.

found within the D_25 ellipse. The nucleus of the galaxy alone accounts for
about 65% of this luminosity. The rest is due to 26 other X-ray sources
(contributing ~10%) and to apparently diffuse emission, which is seen across
much of the galactic disk and is particularly bright in the bulge region around
the nucleus. Spectral analysis further gives evidence for a soft component,
which can be characterized by a two-temperature optically thin plasma with
temperature at ~0.15 keV and 0.60 keV and an absorption of the Galactic
foreground only. These components, accounting for ~13% of the X-ray emission
from the region, apparently arise in a combination of hot gas and faint
discrete sources. We find interesting spatial coincidences of luminous
(10^37-10^40 ergs/s) and variable X-ray sources with shock-heated optical
nebulae. Three of them are previously classified as supernova remnant
candidates. The other one is far off the main body of M81, but is apparently
associated with a dense HI concentration produced most likely by the tidal
interactions of the galaxy with its companions. These associations suggest that
such optical nebulae may be powered by outflows from luminous X-ray binaries,
which are comparable to, or more luminous than Galactic `micro-quasars'.

``disk-like'' or not, if the lensing occurs after the break time. We also show

also suggest that the secular period change seems to be a good observable to
identify the pulsation mode of cooler SX Phe variables. The dependence of

that the secular period change for He-enhanced models is approximately a factor

model results with the unequally sampled observational data consists in
calculation of the model light curve in equidistant points of the canonical

electron distribution affects the synchrotron process as well as Comptonization
in plasmas with parameters typical for accretion flows onto black holes. We
find that the presence of the tail can significantly increase the net (after
accounting for self-absorption) cyclo-synchrotron emission of the plasma, which
emission then provides seed photons for Compton upscattering. Thus, the
luminosity in the thermally-Comptonized spectrum is enhanced as well. The
importance of these effects increases with both increasing Eddington ratio and
the black hole mass. The enhancement of the Comptonized synchrotron luminosity
can be as large as by factors of $\sim 10^3$ and $\sim 10^5$ for stellar and
supermassive black holes, respectively, when the energy content in the
non-thermal tail is 1 per cent.
  The presence of the tail only weakly hardens the thermal Comptonization
spectrum but it leads to formation of a high-energy tail beyond the thermal
cut-off, which two effects are independent of the nature of the seed photons.
Since observations of high-energy tails in Comptonization spectra can constrain
the non-thermal tails in the electron distribution and thus the Comptonized
synchrotron luminosity, they provide upper limits on the strength of magnetic
fields in accretion flows. In particular, the measurement of an MeV tail in the
hard state of Cyg X-1 by McConnell et al. implies the magnetic field strength
in this source to be at most an order of magnitude below equipartition.

YBa2Cu3Oy(YBCO) was measured in order to investigate the electronic state
inside and outside the vortex core. The magnetic-field dependence of the
complex surface impedance at low temperatures was in good agreement with a
general vortex dynamics description assuming that the field-independent viscous
damping force and the linear restoring force were acting on the vortices. In
other words, both real and imaginary parts of the complex resistivity, \rho_1,
and \rho_2, were linear in B. This is explained by theories for d-wave
superconductors. Using analysis based on the Coffey-Clem description of the
complex penetration depth, we estimated that the vortex viscosity \eta at 10 K
was (4 \sim 5) \times 10^{-7} Ns/m^2. This value corresponds to \omega_0 \tau
\sim 0.3 - 0.5, where \omega_0 and \tau are the minimal gap frequency and the
quasiparticle lifetime in the vortex core, respectively. These results suggest
that the vortex core in YBCO is in the moderately clean regime. Investigation
of the moderately clean vortex core in high-temperature superconductors is
significant because physically new effects may be expected due to d-wave
characteristics and to the quantum nature of cuprate superconductors. The
behavior of Z_s as a function of B across the first order transition (FOT) of
the vortex lattice was also investigated. Unlike Bi2Sr2CaCu2Oy (BSCCO), no
distinct anomaly was observed around the FOT in YBCO. Our results suggest that
the rapid increase of X_s due to the change of superfluid density at the FOT
would be observed only in highly anisotropic two-dimensional vortex systems
like BSCCO. We discuss these results in terms of the difference of the

investigated the complex surface impedance, Zs, of YBa2Cu3Oy as a function of
magnetic field, H. The total features were well expressed by the Coffey-Clem
model. From the data, we estimated the viscosity and pinning frequency, which
were found to be independent of frequency. In particular, the obtained
viscosity definitely shows that the core of vortex of YBa2Cu3Oy is moderately
clean. This result suggests that new physics will show up, for the physics of
quantum moderately clean vortex core is unknown at all. (2) An anomaly found in
the surface reactance at the first order transition (FOT) of vortex lattice was
investigated in Bi2Sr2CaCu2Oy with various doping levels. As a result, the
anomaly was found only in the samples exhibiting the FOT. On the other hand, we
did not observe the anomaly in YBa2Cu3Oy. These suggest that the anomaly is due
to the change in the electronic states of the vortices characteristic of
materials with very strong anisotropy. (3) We measured H dependence of both the
thermal conductivity \kappa(H) and Zs(H) in exactly the same pieces of crystal.
We could not find any anomaly in Zs(H) even at the onset of the plateau. This
result suggests that the origin of the plateau in \kappa(H) is not a drastic
phase transition but is rather gradual crossover.

spin singlet with an excitation gap $\Delta/k_{\rm B}=11.2$ K. Magnetization
plateaus were observed at zero and at half of the saturation magnetization.
These results indicate that the present system can be represented by a coupled

into a quark jet function, which is defined by a matrix element of a quark
field attached by a Wilson line. The factorization of the jet function from the
decay $B\to\gamma l\bar\nu$ is proved to all orders. Threshold resummation for
the jet function leads to a universal, {\it i.e.}, process-independent, Sudakov
factor, whose qualitative behavior is analyzed and found to smear the end-point
singularities in heavy-to-light transition form factors.

Recently the attention has shifted from the irreducible case to include more
general dilation groups, for instance cyclic (more generally: discrete) or
one-parameter groups. These groups do not give rise to irreducible
square-integrable representations, yet it is possible (and quite simple) to
give admissibility conditions for a large class of them.

uniquely.

error < 1% when used together with the Argonne v18 two-nucleon interaction. In
one of the models the pi-N S-wave scattering interaction is set to zero; in all
others it has the strength suggested by chiral effective field theory. One
model also assumes that the pi-N P-wave scattering interaction has the strength
suggested by effective field theories, and the cutoff is adjusted to fit the
data. In all other models the cutoff is taken to be the same as in the AV18
interaction. The effect of relativistic boost correction is estimated. Results
obtained with only Argonne v8' and v18 interactions are also reported. In
