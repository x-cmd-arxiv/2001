represents an intriguing possible solution to the hierarchy problem. At present
the strongest constraint on the existence of such compact Gravity-Only
Dimensions (GODs) comes from SN1987a. Here we report on the first
self-consistent simulations of the early, neutrino-emitting phase of a
proto-neutron star which include energy losses due to the coupling of the
Kaluza-Klein modes of the graviton which arise in a world with GODs. We compare
the neutrino signals from these simulations to that from SN1987a and use a
rigorous probabilistic analysis to derive improved bounds for the radii of such
GODs. We find that the possibility that there are two compact extra dimensions
with radii larger than 0.66 $\mu$m is excluded at the 95% confidence level---as
is the possibility that there are three compact extra dimensions larger than
0.8 nm.

all exhibiting X-ray luminosity in the range 10^{39}-1.5x10^{40} erg s^{-1}. As
already reported, IC 342 source 1 showed short-term X-ray intensity variability
by a factor of 2.0 on a typical time scale of 10 ks. M81 X-6 varied by a factor
of 1.6 across seven observations spanning 3 years, while NGC 1313 source B
varied by a factor of 2.5 between two observations conducted in 1993 July and
1995 November. The ASCA spectra of these sources, acquired on these occasions,
were all described successfully as optically-thick emission from standard
accretion disks around black holes. This confirms previous ASCA works which
explained ULXs as mass-accreting massive black-hole binaries. In all three
sources, the disk color temperature was uncomfortably high at T_{in}=1.0-2.0
keV, and was found to vary in proportion to the square-root of the source flux.
The apparent accretion-disk radius is hence inferred to change as inversely
proportional to T_{in}. This suggests a significant effect of advection in the
accretion disk. However, even taking this effect fully into account, the too
high values of T_{in} of ULXs cannot be explained. Further invoking the rapid
black-hole rotation may give a solution to this issue.

transient XTE J1118+480 in 2000 are akin to superoutbursts of SU UMa stars. In
these systems a `normal' outburst immediately precedes a 5-10 times longer
(`super')outburst. The optical light curve of the outbursts of XTE J1118+480 is
remarkably similar to that seen in some SU UMa stars, such as UV Per and T Leo,
where the precursor outburst is distinct from the superoutburst, but the time
scales are a factor of ~15 different. The first outburst of XTE J1118+480 was
relatively short (~1 month) while the second outburst was ~5 times longer.
During the second outburst superhumps were seen, a feature characteristic for
superoutbursts. The gap of about a month between the two outbursts is longer in
X-rays with respect to the optical, a feature not previously recognized for
X-ray transients. Also in SU UMa stars the precursor outburst becomes more
distinct at shorter wavelengths. Finally, I show that the time of appearance of
the superhumps in XTE J1118+480 is consistent with the expected superhump
growth time, if the superhump mechanism was triggered during the first
outburst. I conclude that the similarity in outburst behaviour in the two types
of systems provides further support that a common mechanism is at work to start
the long (`super')outbursts.

  To model the features of astrophysical systems, which are usually

resolution and large domain size to model as many features as possible, on
various scales, within a particular system. In addition, the time-scales

  These two limits (resolution and time-scales) enforce huge limits on

presence of a disk of planetesimals extending out to 120-150 AU, perturbed
gravitationally by a giant planet on an inclined orbit, following the approach

the source of a distribution of grains produced through collisional evolution,
with the same initial orbital parameter distribution. The steady state spatial
grain distribution is found incorporating the effects of radiation pressure
which can cause the distribution of the smallest particles to become very
distended. With realistic assumptions about the grains' chemical properties,
the modeling confirms the previously evident need for an additional population
of hot grains close to the star, to account for the 12 microns fluxes at short
distances from the star. It also indicates that this population cannot explain
the outer 12 microns flux distribution when the effects of gravity and
radiation pressure determine the distribution. Very small grains, produced by
collisions among aggregates, are tentatively proposed to account for this 12
microns outer emission.

formation of monodispersed colloids proceeds through a more complex mechanism,
than the generally excepted diffusional ""burst nucleation"" process. Instead,
the synthesis of narrow-size-distribution colloidal dispersions involves
several stages, i.e., nuclei produced in a supersaturated solution, grow to
nanosize subunits, which then aggregate to form much larger uniform secondary
particles. To explain the size selection in such a series of processes, a
kinetic model was developed which combined two growth/aggregation stages. This
earlier study has shown the burst-nucleation growth of the primary particles to
depend strongly on the value of the effective surface tension entering the
surface term in the free energy of the subcritical embryos. The aim of the
present work has been to identify an appropriate control parameter in the
process of secondary particle aggregation. Modifications of the aggregation
rates to account for singlet size and aggregate diffusivity produced only small
changes. However, introduction of a ""bottle-neck"" factor in the dimer formation
rate had a profound effect on the final size distribution and suggested a
possible size-control mechanism.

Field-theoretic methods (renormalization group results in conjunction with
functional methods) are used to give a systematic derivation of singularities
occurring at critical end points. Specifically, the thermal singularity
$\sim|{t}|^{2-\alpha}$ of the first-order line on which the disordered or
ordered phase coexists with the noncritical spectator phase, and the
coexistence singularity $\sim |{t}|^{1-\alpha}$ or $\sim|{t}|^{\beta}$ of the
secondary density $<\psi>$ are derived. It is clarified how the renormalization
group (RG) scenario found in position-space RG calculations, in which the
critical end point and the critical line are mapped onto two separate fixed
points ${\mathcal P}_{\mathrm{CEP}}^*$ and ${\mathcal P}_{\lambda}^*$
translates into field theory. The critical RG eigenexponents of ${\mathcal

${\mathcal P}_{\mathrm{CEP}}^*$ is demonstrated to have a discontinuity
eigenperturbation (with eigenvalue $y=d$), tangent to the unstable trajectory
that emanates from ${\mathcal P}_{\mathrm{CEP}}^*$ and leads to ${\mathcal
P}_{\lambda}^*$. The nature and origin of this eigenperturbation as well as the
role redundant operators play are elucidated. The results validate that the

energy tensor. This second quasi-spherical approximation thereby includes
gravitational radiation reaction, such as the back-reaction on the black hole.
With respect to a canonical flow of time, the combined energy-momentum of the
matter and gravitational radiation is covariantly conserved. The corresponding
Noether charge is a local gravitational mass-energy. Energy conservation is
formulated as a local first law relating the gradient of the gravitational mass
to work and energy-supply terms, including the energy flux of the gravitational
radiation. Zeroth, first and second laws of black-hole dynamics are given,

relatively low temperature in the thermal history of the Universe for the
unwanted relics to be diluted. This requires a mechanism for the baryogenesis
after the entropy production, and the Affleck and Dine (AD) mechanism is a
promising candidate for it. The AD baryogenesis in the GMSB model predicts the
existence of the baryonic Q ball, that is the B ball, and this may work as the
dark matter in the Universe. In this article, we discuss the stability of the B
ball in th presence of baryon-number violating interactions. We find that the
evaporation rate increases monotonically with the B-ball charge because the
large field value inside the B ball enhances the effect of the
baryon-number-violating operators. While there are some difficulties to
evaluate the evaporation rate of the B ball, we derive the evaporation time
(lifetime) of the B ball for the mass-to-charge ratio $\omega_0\gsim 100 \MEV$.
The lifetime of the B ball and the distortion of the cosmic ray positron flux
and the cosmic background radiation from the B ball evaporation give
constraints on the baryon number of the B ball and the interaction, if the B
ball is the dark matter. We also discuss some unresolved properties of the B
ball.

self-adaptability of exploration: different genotypes that map to the same

self-adaptability requires a variation of exploration strategies along such a

considered allow a local classical model. All these inequalities can be
summarized in a single, albeit non-linear inequality. We show that quantum
correlations satisfy this condition provided the state has positive partial
transpose with respect to any grouping of the n systems into two subsystems. We
also provide an efficient algorithm for finding the maximal quantum mechanical
violation of each inequality, and show that the maximum is always attained for
the generalized GHZ state.

freedom of all the particles involved is necessary in order to reproduce
correctly the observed experimental data.
