remnant galaxy NGC 7252 by obtaining K band photometry for these clusters. Our
K band data significantly complement the optical photometry and spectroscopy in
the literature: K band data are fundamental to study the Asymptotic Giant
Branch (AGB) population of these clusters, since the AGB phase transition
(occuring between the age of 200 Myr and 1 Gyr) causes abrupt changes in the
near-infrared luminosity of the clusters while producing only small changes in
the optical. Therefore, the e.g. V-K colour is ideal to study this evolutionary
phase of stellar populations. For the present analysis we present models for
Simple Stellar Populations which include the contribution of the AGB stellar
phase, calibrated with the young and intermediate age star clusters of the
Magellanic Clouds. The comparison with the colour distribution of the NGC 7252
star clusters shows that they are indeed intermediate age clusters undergoing
the AGB phase transition. The AGB phase transition is observed for the first
time outside the Local Group. Most of the studied clusters span the very narrow
age range 300-500 Myr, and likely have metallicities 0.5-1 Z_{\odot}. A very
important exception is the cluster W32, which has already completed its AGB
epoch, its colours being consistent with an age of 1-2 Gyr. This impacts on the
duration of the merger-induced starburst. The strengths of the magnesium and
iron lines in the spectrum of the best observed cluster W3, and in the spectrum
of the diffuse central light of NGC 7252, do not show an overabundance in
alpha-elements, in contrast to the bulk stellar population of elliptical
galaxies.

slowly rotating stars among the solar-type stars ($\sim 0.6-1.2 M_{\odot}$) in
the same young star clusters has been a puzzle in the field of stellar
rotation. No model to date has been able to explain both by a single mechanism
intrinsic to the star and questions about the appropriate initial conditions
for models often complicate the problem.
  In this paper, using the same starting conditions for the models that we used
in examining the origin of the ultra-fast rotators in young star clusters, we
show that the slowest rotators demand an extrinsic mechanism. Assuming that
this mechanism is a disk-star interaction, we determine that a disk-locking
timescale of a few Myr must operate for this type of star. If, instead of
allowing (radial) differential rotation, we enforce solid-body rotation, the
models require timescales about two to three times as long.

the mere existence of negative values for the linear two-point correlation
function $\xib_L$ over some range of scales starting from $l = L_o$, implies
that the non-linear correlation function is bounded from above at {\it all}
scales $x < L_o$. This also results in the relation $\xib \propto x^{-3}$, at
these scales, at late times, independent of the original form of the
correlation function. Current observations do not rule out the existence of
negative $\xib$ for $ 200 h^{-1}$ Mpc $\la \xib \la 1000 h^{-1}$ Mpc; the

  Uses AASTeX",,"10.1086/320972",,"astro-ph",,"  Evidence for a transitional stage in the formation of a low-mass star is
reported, intermediate between the fully embedded and the T Tauri phases.
Millimeter aperture synthesis observations in the HCO+ J=1-0 and 3-2, HCN 1-0,
13CO 1-0, and C18O 1-0 transitions reveal distinctly different velocity fields
around two embedded, low-mass young stellar objects. The 0.6 M(sun) of material
around TMC 1 (IRAS 04381+2517) closely follows inside-out collapse in the
presence of a small amount of rotation (~3 km/s/pc), while L1489 IRS (IRAS
04016+2610) is surrounded by a 2000 AU radius, flared disk containing 0.02
M(sun). This disk shows Keplerian rotation around a ~0.65 M(sun) star and
infall at 1.3 (r/100 AU)^-0.5 km/s, or, equivalently, sub-Keplerian motions
around a central object between 0.65 and 1.4 M(sun). Its density is
characterized by a radial power law and an exponential vertical scale height.
The different relative importance of infall and rotation around these two
objects suggests that rotationally supported structures grow from collapsing
envelopes over a few times 10^5 yr to sizes of a few thousand AU, and then
decrease over a few times 10^4 yr to several hundred AU typical for T Tauri
disks. In this scenario, L1489 IRS represents a transitional phase between
embedded YSOs and T Tauri stars with disks. The expected duration of this phase
of ~5% of the embedded stage is consistent with the current lack of other known
objects like L1489 IRS. Alternative explanations cannot explain L1489 IRS's
large disk, such as formation from a cloud core with an unusually large
velocity gradient or a binary companion that prevents mass accretion onto small
scales. It follows that the transfer and dissipation of angular momentum is key
to understanding the formation of disks from infalling envelopes.

that the apparent superluminal motions in $\gamma$-ray sources are much faster
than for the general population of bright compact radio sources. This follows
the strong dependence of the $\gamma$-ray flux on the level of relativistic
beaming for both external-radiation Compton and synchrotron self-Compton
emission. There is a positive correlation (correlation coefficient $r$=0.45)
between the flux density of the VLBI core and the $\gamma$-ray flux and a
moderate correlation (partial correlation coefficient $r$=0.31) between
$\gamma$-ray apparent luminosity and superluminal velocities of jet components,
as expected if the $\gamma$-ray emission originates in a very compact region of
the relativistic jet and is highly beamed. In 43% of the sources the jet bends
by more than 20$^\circ$ on parsec scales, which is consistent with
amplification by projection effects of modest actual changes in position angle.
  In 27 of the sources in the sample there is at least one non-core component
that appears to be stationary during our observations. Different
characteristics of stationary features close to and farther from the core lead
us to suggest two different classes of stationary components: those within
about 2 milliarcseconds (mas) of the core, probably associated with standing

associated with bends in the jet.

of the asymmetry between the two peaks as seen in earlier observations. The
light curves are well fit by models incorporating ellipsoidal variations from
the mass-losing K-type star plus a beamed bright spot on the accretion disk

out superhumps and star spots as sources of asymmetry when we observed
A0620-00. The ellipsoidal variations yield a lower limit i >= 38 deg on the

upper limit i <= 75 deg. This range of inclinations constrains the mass of the

constrain the orbital inclination because the contribution of the accretion
disk to the observed flux is unknown. We argue that a previous attempt to

under the assumption that the afterglow and microlensing event parameters are
known. For a point-mass lens and uniform source, we derive a simple scaling
relation between these parameters and the resultant errors. The afterglow need
not be monitored for its entire duration; rather, observations from the peak
magnification time t_p of the microlensing event until 7 t_p are sufficient to
resolve the majority of the image. Thus, microlensing events can be alerted by
relatively infrequent observations of afterglows and then monitored
intensively, without significant loss of information about the afterglow
intensity profile. The relative intensity profile of about 1% of all afterglows
can be measured with 10 resolution elements to an accuracy of 1% in the optical
and 10% in the infrared, using 4m-class telescopes. Weak microlensing events
with large impact parameters are more common; we estimate that for about 10% of
afterglows the image profile may be inverted to a fractional accuracy 20%
through frequent optical observations. We also calculate the effects of
external shear due to the host galaxy or a binary companion, and contamination
by background light from the host galaxy.

nucleosynthesis is currently used to provide a robust upper limit on the
cosmological density parameter $\Omega_0$. Current analyses lead to gas
fractions at virial radius which are typically of the order of
0.20$h^{-3/2}_{50}$, favoring a low density universe. In this work, we examine
critically this issue through the analysis of the baryon distribution in
clusters. We find that the currently derived gas fraction profile, increases
regularly from the inner part to the outer part, up to the virial radius, and
beyond. Such a shape contrasts with what is expected from numerical
hydro-dynamical simulations, in which the gas fraction is more or less constant
in the outer region, reaching a plateau when the contrast density falls off
below $10^4$. We argue that such a difference is hardly explained by reheating
effects, while taking into account various factors entering into the
determination of clusters gas fraction may erase such a difference. Indeed,
using recent estimates on gas content in the outer part of clusters (Vikhlinin
et al., 1999) and applying the correction factor due to the effect of gas
clumping, we find that the gas fraction shape over the range $ 200< \delta<
10^5$ is roughly consistent with hydro-dynamical simulations for an universal
gas fraction in the range 8-11% (for $h_{50} =1.$), the mass estimators being
calibrated from numerical simulations. In contrast, values of the order of 20%
do not give acceptable fit to the data on any scale. We conclude, that high
values of $\Omega_0$ can not be ruled out on the basis of the baryon fraction
argument.

Consequently, it does not require the use of an additive form of entropy. We
discuss the problem of the choice of the most convenient entropy indicator,
focusing our attention on a system of 2 qubits, and on a special set, denoted
by $\Im$. This set contains both the maximally and the partially entangled
states that are described by density matrices diagonal in the Bell basis set.
We select this set for the main purpose of making more straightforward our work
of analysis. As a matter of fact, we find that in general the conventional von
Neumann entropy is not a monotonic function of the entanglement strength. This
means that the von Neumann entropy is not a reliable indicator of the departure
from the condition of maximum entanglement. We study the behavior of a form of
non-additive entropy, made popular by the 1988 work by Tsallis. We show that in
the set $\Im$, implying the key condition of non-vanishing entanglement, this
non-additive entropy indicator turns out to be a strictly monotonic function of
the strength of the entanglement, if entropy indexes $q$ larger than a critical
value $Q$ are adopted. We argue that this might be a consequence of the
non-additive nature of the Tsallis entropy, implying that the world is quantum

the time variations in the temperature of a cellular tissue undergoing repeated

the cosmological constant problem can be resolved. We find that the RS models

solutions in Type 0B string theory. We first consider the most general
configuration of parallel N electric and M magnetic D3-branes. The field theory
living on their worldvolume is non-supersymmetric and non-conformal (if N is
different from M) and has gauge group SU(N)XSU(M). We study the IR regime of
the conjectured dual gravity background. A fine tuned solution exists with an
asymptotically vanishing tachyon and a running dilaton, which could correspond
to a flow towards an IR isolated fixed point at strong coupling. This opens the
question upon the possibility of extending AdS/CFT techniques to flows towards
IR isolated fixed points. We then use D3-branes as probes of this and other
Type 0 backgrounds available in literature which cover the M=0 (or N=0) case.
We shaw that for the fine tuned IR conformal solutions the stacks of parallel
branes are plagued by instabilities, due to the repulsive force between branes
of the same type. Curiously, for a particular solution which could be dual to a
confining gauge theory, the stack should instead be stable.

energies are presented within a semi-classical BUU transport model that
includes the off-shell propagation of vector mesons nonperturbatively and
calculates the width of the vector mesons dynamically. Different scenarios of
in-medium modifications of vector mesons, such as collisional broadening and
dropping vector meson masses, are investigated and the possibilities for an
experimental observation of in-medium effects in $p A$ reactions at 1--4 GeV
are discussed for a variety of nuclear targets.

  plasmas","46 pages tex",,,,"physics.plasm-ph physics.space-ph",,"  The PDE's of classical electromagnetism can be generated from two exterior
differential systems that distinguish topologically the field intensities and
potentials, F-dA= 0, from the field excitations and the charge current
densities, J-dG = 0. The existence of potentials, A, leads to the independent
3-forms of T-Torsion = A^F and T-Spin = A^G. The exterior derivatives
(divergences) of these 3-forms produce anomalies that define the two classic
Poincare invariants. The closed integrals of these forms, when deformation
invariants of frozen-in fields, define topological coherent structures in the
plasma. Solutions when T-Torsion (T-Spin) is zero define transverse magnetic
(electric) modes on topological grounds. When the divergence of T-Torsion is
not zero there exists a classical mechanism for charge acceleration along the
magnetic field lines producing symplectic plasma currents; large temperature
gradients along the B field lines can act as a source of stellar plasma jets in
neutron stars. In such circumstances, the Torsion vector is uniquely defined by
conformal invariance of the Action potentials. Plasma currents in the direction
of the Torsion vector leave both A^F and A^G conformally invariant, hence these
fields are frozen-in even though the processes are thermodynamically
irreversible. The decaying coherent and deformable topological structures
associated with such frozen-in fields are persistent and observable artifacts,
similar to wakes, that can appear in any plasma domain, such as that which
surrounds stars.

  Naturforsch. A","Z. Naturforsch. A 56, 83-90 (2001)","10.1515/zna-2001-0113",,"quant-ph",,"  The quantum Zeno effect (QZE) is the striking prediction that the decay of
any unstable quantum state can be inhibited by sufficiently frequent
observations (measurements). The consensus opinion has upheld the QZE as a
general feature of quantum mechanics, which should lead to the inhibition of
any decay. The claim of QZE generality hinges on the assumption that successive
observations can in principle be made at time intervals too short for the
system to change appreciably. However, this assumption and the generality of
the QZE have scarcely been investigated thus far. We have addressed these
issues by showing that (i) the QZE is principally unattainable in radiative or
radioactive decay, because the required measurement rates would cause the
system to disintegrate; (ii) decay acceleration by frequent measurements (the
anti-Zeno effect -- AZE) is much more ubiquitous than its inhibition. The AZE
is shown to be observable as the enhancement of tunneling rates (e.g., for
atoms trapped in ramped-up potentials or in current-swept Josephson junctions),
fluorescence rates (e.g., for Rydberg atoms perturbed by noisy optical fields)
and photon depolarization rates (in randomly modulated Pockels cells).
