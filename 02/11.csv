during 2000 that were designed to detect efficiently gravitational microlensing
of faint stars in which the magnification is high and/or of short duration.
These events are particularly useful for studies of extra-solar planets and
faint stars. Approximately 17 degrees square were monitored at a sampling rate
of up to 6 times per night. The images were analysed in real-time using a
difference imaging technique. Twenty microlensing candidates were detected, of
which 8 were alerted to the microlensing community whilst in progress.
Approximately half of the candidates had high magnifications (>~10), at least
one had very high magnification (>~50), and one exhibited a clear parallax
effect. The details of these events are reported here, together with details of
the on-line difference imaging technique. Some nova-like events were also
observed and these are described, together with one asteroid.

observed abundance ratio [X/Zn] (where Zn is assumed to be undepleted and X
stands for the refractories Fe, Cr and Ni) and metal column density
([Zn/H]+log(N{HI})) in DLAs. We suggest that this trend is an unambiguous sign
of dust depletion, since metal column density is a measure of the amount of
dust along the line of sight. Assuming that DLAs are (proto-)galactic disks and
using detailed chemical evolution models with metallicity dependent yields we
study chemical evolution and dust depletion patterns for alpha and iron-peak
elements in DLAs. When observational constraints on the metal column density of
DLAs are taken into account (as suggested in Boisse et al. 1998) we find that
our models reproduce fairly well the observed mild redshift evolution of the
abundances of 8 elements (Al, Si, S, Cr, Mn, Fe, Zn and Ni) as well as the
observed scatter at a given redshift. By considering the aforementioned
dependence of abundance ratios on metal column density, we further explore the
general dust depletion pattern in DLAs, comparing to our model results and to a
solar reference pattern. We suggest that further measurements of the key
elements, i.e. Zn, S and Mn, will help to gain more insight into the nature of
DLAs. In any case, the presently uncertain nucleosynthesis of Zn in massive
stars (on which a large part of these conclusions is based) should be carefully
scrutinised.

  astro-ph/0101321 (Frank Eisenhauer)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is an underlying distribution
function which determines many important observables, from the number of
ionizing photons in a population of some age and metallicity, through the
creation rate of various chemical elements, to the mass to light ratio of a
system. This significance, together with the empirical difficulty to determine
the IMF robustly, and the near complete lack of any robust theoretical
predictor, has allowed investigators freedom to treat the IMF as a continuously
variable parameterisation of astrophysicists' ignorance of complexity. An
ability to vary a parameter in a model is not the same as a true variation in a
physical system. A more instructive approach is to use available data to
constrain possible variations, and thereby to allow identification of those
other aspects of an observed system whose understanding can be improved.
Ideally, the most sensitive physical variable, or its parameterisation, should
be the best constrained. A fundamental null hypothesis, which we defend here,
is that the IMF is a universal invariant function, so that all apparent
variations may be ascribed to other variables, and to irreducible statistical
sampling fluctuations.

given volume into its divergent component due to the density fluctuations
inside the volume, and its tidal component due to the matter distribution
outside the volume. The input consists of the density and velocity fields that
are reconstructed either by POTENT or by Wiener Filter from a survey of
peculiar velocities. The tidal field is further decomposed into a bulk velocity
and a shear field. The method is applied here to the Mark III data within a
sphere of radius 60 Mpc/h about the Local Group, and to the SFI data for
comparison. We find that the tidal field contributes about half of the
Local-Group velocity with respect to the CMB, with the tidal bulk velocity
pointing to within ~ 30 degrees of the CMB dipole. The eigenvector with the
largest eigenvalue of the shear tensor is aligned with the tidal bulk velocity
to within ~ 40 degrees. The tidal field thus indicates the important dynamical
role of a super attractor of mass (2-5) x 10^17 M_sun/h Omega^0.4 at ~ 150
Mpc/h, coinciding with the Shapley Concentration. There is also a hint for the
dynamical role of two big voids in the Supergalactic Plane. The results are
consistent for the two data sets and the two methods of reconstruction.

the electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda$ is larger than 1 for any ratio

  In the extreme adiabatic limit of the Holstein model electrons collapse into
self-trapped small polarons or bipolarons due to spontaneous
translational-symmetry breaking when $\lambda$ is between 0.5 and 1.3
(depending on the lattice dimensionality). With the increasing phonon frequency
the region of the applicability of the theory shrinks to lower values of the
