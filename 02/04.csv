synthesizing spectral properties of a galaxy using a base of star clusters. The
problem consists of estimating the population vector x, composed by the
contributions of n_star base elements to the integrated spectrum of a galaxy,
and the extinction A_V, given a set of absorption line equivalent widths and
continuum colors. The formalism is applied to the n_star = 12 base defined by
Schmidt etal and subsequently used in several studies. The 13-D parameter space
is explored with a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme based on the
Metropolis algorithm, which produces a smooth and efficient mapping of the
P(x,A_V) probability distribution.
  This version of Empirical Population Synthesis is used to investigate the
ability to recover the detailed history of star-formation and chemical
evolution using this spectral base. This is studied as a function of (1) the
magnitude of the measurement errors and (2) the set of observables used in the
synthesis. Only for extremely high S/N all 12 base proportions can be
accurately recovered, though the observables are very precisely reproduced for
any S/N. Furthermore, the individual mean x components are biased in the sense
that components which carry a large fraction of the light tend to share their
contribution preferably among components of same age. This compensation effect
is linked to noise-induced linear dependences in the base, which very
effectively redistribute the likelihood in x-space. The age distribution,
however, can be satisfactorily recovered for realistic data quality. (abridged)

is to provide the students with the information and tools to familiarize with a
few basic questions: 1) What are the scaling laws followed by the clustering of
luminous objects over almost four decades of scales; 2) How galaxy motions
distort the observed maps in redshift space, and how we can correct and use
them to our benefit; 3) Is the observed clustering of galaxies suggestive of a
fractal Universe; and consequently, 4) Is our faith in the Cosmological
Principle still well placed, i.e. do we see evidence for a homogeneous
distribution of matter on the largest explorable scales, in terms of the
correlation function and power spectrum of the distribution of luminous
objects. For some of these questions we have a well--defined answer, but for
some others the goal is to indicate the path along which there is still a good
deal of exciting work to be done.

particles interacting via a smoothed Newtonian potential as a function of the
total energy E and the total angular momentum L are discussed. In order to
estimate suitable observables a numerical method based on an importance
sampling algorithm is presented. The entropy surface shows a negative specific
heat region at fixed L for all L. Observables probing the average mass
distribution are used to understand the link between thermostatistical
properties and the spatial distribution of particles. In order to define a
phase in non-extensive system we introduce a more general observable than the
one proposed by Gross and Votyakov [Eur. Phys. J. B:15, 115 (2000)]: the sign
of the largest eigenvalue of the entropy surface curvature. At large E the
gravitational system is in a homogeneous gas phase. At low E there are several
collapse phases; at L=0 there is a single cluster phase and for L>0 there are
several phases with 2 clusters. All these pure phases are separated by first
order phase transition regions. The signal of critical behaviour emerges at
different points of the parameter space (E,L). We also discuss the ensemble
introduced in a recent pre-print by Klinko & Miller; this ensemble is the
canonical analogue of the one at constant energy and constant angular momentum.
We show that a huge loss of informations appears if we treat the system as a
function of intensive parameters: besides the known non-equivalence at first
order phase transitions, there exit in the microcanonical ensemble some values
of the temperature and the angular velocity for which the corresponding
canonical ensemble does not exist, i.e. the partition sum diverges.

radiation (EMR) had effects on humans which could not be explained by
detectible heating of tissue. Auditory responses to radar, called microwave
hearing, have been the best known of these phenomena. To account for microwave
hearing, many studies in the literature have adopted a rate-of-heating
hypothesis advanced by Foster and Finch in 1974. We show here that theoretical
and experimental studies supporting this hypothesis are weaker than usually
assumed.
  We develop a simple framework of understanding of EMR that may be used to
explain microwave hearing as a nonthermal, nonacoustic effect. We then extend
this approach to other contexts, pointing out several fundamental
misconceptions confounding the field.
  EMR, especially wide-band EMR, primarily must have a nonthermal effect on
living tissue before conversion to heat. Auditory and tactile sensations,
central neurological disability, and blood pressure loss caused by EMR have
been documented. Except microwave hearing, parameters of irradiation causing
such effects have not been explored adequately and remain unknown. There
appears not to be any forensic methodology to prove the cause of harm at
nonthermal levels.

directly from the standard operator formulation. The covariant generalization
of Moyal theory, also known as Vey quantum mechanics, was presented in the
literature many years ago. However, a derivation of the formalism directly from
standard operator quantum mechanics, clarifying the relation between the two
formulations is still missing. In this paper we present a covariant
generalization of the Weyl order prescription and of the Weyl-Wigner map and
use them to derive Vey quantum mechanics directly from the standard operator
formulation. The procedure displays some interesting features: it yields all
the key ingredients and provides a more straightforward interpretation of the
Vey theory including a direct implementation of unitary operator
transformations as phase space coordinate transformations in the Vey idiom.
These features are illustrated through a simple example.

the density operator describing time-dependent measurements or histories
continuous in time. We obtain an exact series solution and discuss its
applications. Suppose the system is initially in a state with density operator
$\rho(0)$ and the projection operator $E(t) = U(t) E U^\dagger(t)$ is measured
continuously from $t = 0$ to $T$, where $E$ is a projector obeying $E\rho(0) E
= \rho(0)$ and $U(t)$ a unitary operator obeying $U(0) = 1$ and some smoothness
conditions in $t$. Then the probability of always finding $E(t) = 1$ from $t =
0$ to $T$ is unity. Generically $E(T) \neq E$ and the watched system is sure to
change its state, which is the anti-Zeno paradox noted by us recently. Our
results valid for projectors of arbitrary rank generalize those obtained by
Anandan and Aharonov for projectors of unit rank.
