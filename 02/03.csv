finer divisions than the traditional isolated and clustered modes. Using the
observed set of galactic open clusters and theoretical considerations regarding
cluster formation, we estimate the fraction of star formation that takes place
within clusters. We find that less than 10% of the stellar population
originates from star forming regions destined to become open clusters,
confirming earlier estimates. The smallest clusters included in the
observational surveys (having at least N=100 members) roughly coincide with the
smallest stellar systems that are expected to evolve as clusters in a dynamical
sense. We show that stellar systems with too few members N < N_\star have
dynamical relaxation times that are shorter than their formation times (1-2
Myr), where the critical number of stars N_\star \approx 100. Our results
suggest that star formation can be characterized by (at least) three principal
modes: I. isolated singles and binaries, II. groups (N<N_\star), and III.
clusters (N>N_\star). Many -- if not most -- stars form through the
intermediate mode in stellar groups with 10<N<100. Such groups evolve and
disperse much more rapidly than open clusters; groups also have a low
probability of containing massive stars and are unaffected by supernovae and
intense ultraviolet radiation fields. Because of their short lifetimes and
small stellar membership, groups have relatively little effect on the star
formation process (on average) compared to larger open clusters.

physics with a minimum of assumptions. The temperature and ionization structure
of the top five Thomson depths of an illuminated disc are calculated while also
demanding that the atmosphere is in hydrostatic equilibrium. In agreement with
Nayakshin, Kazanas & Kallman, we find that there is a rapid transition from hot
to cold material in the illuminated layer. However, the transition is usually
not sharp so that often we find a small but finite region in Thomson depth
where there is a stable temperature zone at T \sim 2 x 10^{6} K due to
photoelectric heating from recombining ions. As a result, the reflection
spectra often exhibit strong features from partially-ionized material,
including helium-like Fe K lines and edges. We find that due to the highly
ionized features in the spectra these models have difficulty correctly
parameterizing the new reflection spectra. There is evidence for a spurious
$R-\Gamma$ correlation in the ASCA energy range, where $R$ is the reflection
fraction for a power-law continuum of index $\Gamma$, confirming the suggestion
of Done & Nayakshin that at least part of the R-Gamma correlation reported by
Zdziarski, Lubinski & Smith for Seyfert galaxies and X-ray binaries might be
due to ionization effects. Although many of the reflection spectra show strong
ionized features, these are not typically observed in most Seyfert and quasar
X-ray spectra.

radio sources. However, debate continues as to whether the underlying cause is
intrinsic or extrinsic. Much previous work has assumed the IDV to be intrinsic
and which implies an extraordinarily compact source for the radio emission; in
contrast, an extrinsic variation due to interstellar scintillation (ISS)
implies a relatively larger source diameter, though at the smaller end of the
range expected for relativistic jet models. Kraus et al. (1999) reported a
marked slowing of the IDV at 6cm wavelength in September 1998, and suggested a
change in the source was responsible. However, here we show that the slowing is
consistent with the annual modulation in scintillation time-scale expected for
ISS, under the assumption that the scattering medium moves with the local
standard of rest (LSR). The ISS time scale is governed by the ISS spatial scale
divided by the Earth's velocity relative to the scattering plasma. It happens
that in the direction of 0917+624 the transverse velocity of the Earth with
respect to the LSR varies widely with a deep minimum in the months of September
to November. Hence the slowing of the IDV in September 1998 strongly suggests
that ISS, rather than intrinsic variation of the source is the dominant cause
of the IDV.

interferometer could not operate when the coherence time was lower than this).
On all nights, the spectrum of the short time scale ($<600$ msec) delay
fluctuations had a shallower spectrum than the theoretical Kolmogorov value of
5/3. On most nights, the mean value of the power law slope was between 1.40 and
1.50. Such a sub-Kolmogorov slope will result in the seeing improving as the
$\approx 0.4$ power of wavelength, rather than the slower 0.2 power predicted

  On four nights, the combination of delay and angle tracking measurements
allowed a derivation of the (multiple) wind velocities of the turbulent layers,

the gap between late L and previously observed T dwarfs. These dwarfs form a
clear spectral sequence, with CH$_{4}$ absorption increasing as the CO
absorption decreases. Water vapor band strengths increase in parallel with the
methane bands and thus also link the L and T types. We suggest that objects
with detectable CO and CH$_{4}$ in the H and K bands should define the earliest
T subclasses. From observations of bright (K~$\leq$~13 mag) L dwarfs found by
2MASS, we find that the onset of detectable amounts of CH$_{4}$ occurs near

case of a pulse produced by a pure $e^+e^-$ pair-electro-magnetic plasma, the
PEM pulse, in the absence of any baryonic matter. The resulting time profiles
show a {\em Fast-Rise-Exponential-Decay} shape, followed by a power-law tail.
This is obtained without any special fitting procedure, but only by fixing the
energetics of the process taking place in a given EMBH of selected mass,
varying in the range from 10 to $10^3$ $M_\odot$ and considering the
relativistic effects to be expected in an electron-positron plasma gradually
reaching transparency. Special attention is given to the contributions from all
regimes with Lorentz $\gamma$ factor varying from $\gamma=1$ to $\gamma=10^4$
in a few hundreds of the PEM pulse travel time. Although the main goal of this
paper is to obtain the elementary spike intensity as a function of the arrival
time, and its observed duration, some qualitative considerations are also
presented regarding the expected spectrum and on its departure from the thermal
one. The results of this paper will be comparable, when data will become
available, with a subfamily of particularly short GRBs not followed by any
afterglow. They can also be propedeutical to the study of longer bursts in
presence of baryonic matter currently observed in GRBs.

low-density liquid (LDL) phase. A first-order transition between two liquids of
different densities is consistent with experimental data for a variety of
materials, including single-component systems such as water, silica and carbon.
Molecular dynamics simulations of very specific models for supercooled water,
liquid carbon and supercooled silica, predict a LDL-HDL critical point, but a
coherent and general interpretation of the LDL-HDL transition is lacking. Here
we show that the presence of a LDL and a HDL can be directly related to an
interaction potential with an attractive part and two characteristic
short-range repulsive distances. This kind of interaction is common to other
single-component materials in the liquid state (in particular liquid metals),
and such potentials are often used to decribe systems that exhibit a density
anomaly. However, our results show that the LDL and HDL phases can occur in
systems with no density anomaly. Our results therefore present an experimental
challenge to uncover a liquid-liquid transition in systems like liquid metals,
regardless of the presence of the density anomaly.

The analysis presented here pertains only to one-dimensional banding patterns

rather than a distribution of them with a range of transformation rates.
Nevertheless, the results are in qualitative agreement with essential features
of the available experimental data. The nonlinear theory also implies that
harder materials, which do not undergo a microstructural instability, may form
isolated shear bands in weak regions or, perhaps, at points of concentrated

the lower exciton band edge, i. e. those determining optical response. We found
that the distribution of the energy spacing between the states that are well
localized at the same segment is characterized by non-zero mean, i.e. these
states undergo repulsion. This repulsion results in a local discrete energy
structure of a localized Frenkel exciton. On the contrary, the energy spacing
distribution for weakly overlapping local ground states (the states with no
nodes within their localization segments) that are localized at different
segments has zero mean and shows almost no repulsion. The typical width of the
latter distribution is of the same order as the typical spacing in the local
discrete energy structure, so that this local structure is hidden; it does not
reveal itself neither in the density of states nor in the linear absorption
spectra. However, this structure affects the two-exciton transitions involving
the states of the same segment and can be observed by the pump-probe
spectroscopy. We analyze also the disorder degree scaling of the first and

at finite strains. A polymer is treated as a network of linear chains linked by
permanent (chemical crosslinks) and temporary (entanglements and van der Waals
forces) junctions. Temporary junctions are assumed to be in two states: loose
(passive) when they impose only topological constrains on available
configurations of chains, and tight (active) when their effect is tantamount to
that for crosslinks. Stretching of a specimen implies that some loose junctions
become active, which decreases the average length of a chain.
  A long chain is treated as an ensemble of inextensible strands connected in
sequel. Two neighboring strands are bridged by a bond which may be in two
conformations: flexed (trans) and extended (cis). A bond in the flexed
conformation is modeled as a linear elastic solid, whereas the mechanical
energy of a bond in the extended conformation (two rigid rods directed along a
straight line) is disregarded. For a virgin specimen, all bonds are in the
flexed conformation. Under loading some bonds are transformed from flexed to
extended conformation.
  Stress-strain relations for a rubbery polymer and kinetic equations for the
trans-cis transition are derived using the laws of thermodynamics. Governing
equations are determined by 5 adjustable parameters which are found by fitting
experimental data in uniaxial tensile tests on natural rubber vulcanizates with
various amounts of crosslinks. Fair agreement is demonstrated between results
of numerical simulation and observations with the elongation ratio up to $k=8$.

non-perturbative. But in a model of screened free monopoles at very high
temperature the known area law follows. The density of these monopoles starts
to contribute to O(g^6) to the pressure. The ratio of the multicharged Wilson
loops is calculable and identical to that of the 't Hooft loops.

courses, one in cryptography, the other in quantum mechanics. During the
courses, she discovers she can use what she has just learned to devise a
cryptographic communication system that automatically detects whether or not
Eve is up to her villainous eavesdropping. Some of the topics discussed are
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, the Vernam cipher, the BB84 and B92
cryptographic protocols. The talk ends with a discussion of some of Eve's
possible eavesdropping strategies, opaque eavesdropping, translucent
eavesdropping, and translucent eavesdropping with entanglement.

quantum systems, not least because of its implications for dynamical
realizability of the kinematical bounds on the optimization of observables. In
this paper we investigate the question of complete controllability for
finite-level quantum systems subject to a single control field, for which the
interaction is of dipole form. Sufficient criteria for complete controllability
of a wide range of finite-level quantum systems are established and the
question of limits of complete controllability is addressed. Finally, the
results are applied to give a classification of complete controllability for
four-level systems.
