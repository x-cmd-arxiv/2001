can be used to determine the cosmological parameters to a very high precision.
The power spectrum of the secondary CMB anisotropies due to the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect (SZE) by clusters of galaxies, can then be studied,
to constrain more cluster specific properties (like gas mass). We show the SZE
power spectrum from clusters to be a sensitive probe of any possible evolution
(or constancy) of the gas mass fraction. The position of the peak of the SZE
power spectrum is a strong discriminatory signature of different gas mass
fraction evolution models. For example, for a flat universe, there can be a
difference in the $l$ values (of the peak) of {\it as much as 3000} between a
constant gas mass fraction model and an evolutionary one. Moreover,
observational determination of power spectrum, from blank sky surveys, is
devoid of any selection effects that can possibly affect targeted X-ray or
radio studies of gas mass fractions in galaxy clusters.

SNR suggest that this system is much older. A few possible explanations of this
discrepancy have been put forward. We offer an alternative one and suggest that
the high spin-down rate of the pulsar characterizes only a relatively short
period of its (present) spin history, and that the enhanced braking torque is
connected with the interaction between the pulsar's magnetosphere and the dense
matter of a circumstellar clump (created during the late evolutionary stages of
the supernova (SN) progenitor star). Our suggestion implies that the ""true"" age
of PSR B1509-58 could be much larger than the spin-down age, and therefore the
SNR MSH 15-52 is a middle-aged remnant similar to the Vela SNR (G 263.9-3.3).
We also suggest that the dense (neutral) gas of the circumstellar clump could
be responsible for the enhanced neutral hydrogen absorption towards PSR
B1509-58, and that the optical emission of an optical counterpart for PSR
B1509-58 should rather be attributed to a bow shock around this pulsar than to
the pulsar itself.

low capital and operating costs. Low cost has a potentially revolutionary
impact since it allows one to dedicate a large telescope to a narrowly focused
project that needs a large quantity of observations. The technology is now well
proven in the laboratory as well as in observatory settings and is stepping
into the mainstream of astronomical research. This paper has two main purposes.
a) To acquaint the astronomical community with LMT zenith observing and to
illustrate the LMT advantage with specific examples of research topics of
current interest that could be carried out only with LMTs because of their low
costs. I argue that LMTs are more versatile than generally thought and that the
challenge is to use LMTs in such ways as to maximize their advantages and
minimize their disadvantages. I briefly review specific issues regarding zenith
telescopes. I then illustrate the LMT advantage with specific examples of
astronomical research. b) I show that the large number of objects observed with
a surveying LMT allows one to carry out cosmological projects at low redshifts.
I show that a variability survey would obtain light curves for several
thousands of type Ia supernovae per year up to z=1 and easily discriminate
among competing cosmological models. The same survey would find large numbers
of MACHOs in clusters of galaxies and in background faint galaxies. Finally, I
discuss a spectrophotometric survey carried out with interference filters,
showing its power to discriminate among cosmological models and to study the
large-scale distribution of galaxies in the Universe.

constrains the masses from above. Assuming a flat CDM model with a cosmological
constant ($\Omega_\Lambda=0.7$), we find that consistency with observations
requires the circular velocities of LBG host haloes to be in the range
100--$300 {\rm km s^{-1}}$. The predicted comoving correlation length of these
objects is $\sim 3 h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, and the predicted velocity dispersion of
their stellar contents is typically $70 {\rm km s^{-1}}$. The same prescription
applied to larger haloes in the CDM cosmogony predicts the existence of
galaxies with star formation rates $\sim 1000 {\rm M_\odot yr^{-1}}$ at
redshift $z\sim 3$. We explore the possibility of identifying these galaxies to
be the bright sub-millimeter (sub-mm) sources detected by SCUBA. The model
predicts that the host haloes of these sub-mm sources are massive. These

length of $\sim 7 h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. The descendants of the bright sub-mm

Seyfert nucleus. The soft (E<=2keV) X-ray emission is complex. There are at
least two thermal-like components, with T1=0.6+/-0.1 keV and T2>=1.3 keV. The
cooler (L(0.1-2.4keV)=1E40 erg/s) component is probably associated with the

of previous work but with considerably reduced statistical errors. These small

Considering the metallicity gradient above the Galactic plane, we introduce a
modified color-magnitude relation that is a function of Galactic height. The
resultant M dwarf luminosity function has a shape similar to that derived using
the local color-magnitude relation but with a higher peak value. The peak
occurs at $M_V \sim 12$ and the luminosity function drops sharply toward $M_V

interpolated from theoretical models with different metallicities to calculate
the mass function. Unlike the mass function obtained using local relations,
which has a power-law index $\alpha = 0.47$, the one derived from the
height-dependent relations tends to be flat ($\alpha = -0.10$). The resultant

nucleation of the 3K-phase exhibits a ``capillary effect'' which can lead to
frustration phenomena for the superconducting states on different
Ru-inclusions. Furthermore, the phase structure of the pair wave function gives
rise to zero-energy quasiparticle states which would be visible in
quasiparticle tunneling spectra. Additional characteristic properties are
associated with the upper critical field Hc2. The 3K-phase has a weaker
anisotropy of Hc2 between the inplane and z-axis orientation than the bulk

Ru-metal which yields a stronger orbital depairing effect for the inplane

There exist generic constraints that must be satisfied in order not for the

in the case of a hybrid inflation model and find that the coupling constant
\lambda between the inflaton and the ``water-fall-direction'' field is bounded

if we adopt the severest constraint from avoiding the problem of the gravitinos
produced non-thermally, \lambda < 7.4 \times 10^{-6} is required, under a

finite center. The homogeneous space G/H has a ""tessellation"" if there is a
discrete subgroup D of G, such that D acts properly discontinuously on G/H, and
the double-coset space D\G/H is compact. Note that if either H or G/H is
compact, then G/H has a tessellation; these are the obvious examples.
  It is not difficult to see that if G has real rank one, then only the obvious
homogeneous spaces have tessellations. Thus, the first interesting case is when
G has real rank two. In particular, R.Kulkarni and T.Kobayashi constructed
examples that are not obvious when G = SO(2,2n) or SU(2,2n). H.Oh and D.Witte
constructed additional examples in both of these cases, and obtained a complete
classification when G = SO(2,2n). We simplify the work of Oh-Witte, and extend
it to obtain a complete classification when G = SU(2,2n). This includes the
construction of another family of examples.
  The main results are obtained from methods of Y.Benoist and T.Kobayashi: we
fix a Cartan decomposition G = KAK, and study the intersection of KHK with A.
Our exposition generally assumes only the standard theory of connected Lie
groups, although basic properties of real algebraic groups are sometimes also
employed; the specialized techniques that we use are developed from a fairly
elementary level.

Sinclair to generate random tilings of regions by lozenges. For an L X L region
we bound the mixing time by O(L^4 log L), which improves on the previous bound
of O(L^7), and we show the new bound to be essentially tight. In another
application we resolve a few questions raised by Diaconis and Saloff-Coste, by
lower bounding the mixing time of various card-shuffling Markov chains. Our
lower bounds are within a constant factor of their upper bounds. When we use
our methods to modify a path-coupling analysis of Bubley and Dyer, we obtain an
