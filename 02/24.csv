examine three of five previously optically-identified X-ray sources which are
spatially correlated with optical supernova remnants (MF54, MF57, and MF83).
The X-ray fluxes from these objects, if due to diffuse emission from the
remnants, are bright enough to require a new class of objects, with the
possible attribution by Wang to diffuse emission from hypernova remnants. Of
the three, MF83 was considered the most likely candidate for such an object due
to its size, nature, and close positional coincidence. However, we find that
MF83 is clearly ruled out as a hypernova remnant by both its temporal
variability and spectrum. The bright X-ray sources previously associated with
MF54 and MF57 are seen by Chandra to be clearly offset from the optical
positions of the supernova remnants by several arc seconds, confirming a result
suggested by the previous work. MF54 does have a faint X-ray counterpart,
however, with a luminosity and temperature consistent with a normal supernova
remnant of its size. The most likely classifications of the sources are as
X-ray binaries. Although counting statistics are limited, over the 0.3--5.0 keV
spectral band the data are well fit by simple absorbed power laws with
luminosities in the 10^38 to 10^39 ergs/s range. The power law indices are
softer than those of Milky Way LMXB of similar luminosities, and are more
consistent with those of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Both the high luminosity
and the soft spectral shape favor these being accreting black hole binaries in
high soft states.

a frequency of 580 Hz, and 4U 1728-34 at a frequency of 363 Hz. We have
computed least squares fits to the oscillations observed during the rising
phase of bursts using a model which includes emission from either a single
circular hot spot or a pair of circular antipodal hot spots on the surface of a
neutron star. We model the spreading of the thermonuclear hot spots by assuming
that the hot spot angular size grows linearly with time. We calculate the flux
as a function of rotational phase from the hot spots and take into account
photon deflection in the relativistic gravitational field of the neutron star
assuming the exterior spacetime is the Schwarzschild metric. We find acceptable
fits with our model and we use these to place constraints on the compactness of
the neutron stars in these sources. For 4U 1636-53, in which detection of a 290

(i.e., mass/radius ratio) is constrained to be M/R < 0.163 at 90% confidence (G

stellar interior. For example, if the neutron star has a mass of 1.4 Msun then
its radius must be > 12.8 km. Fits using a single hot spot model are not as

motivate the very existence of the spiral galaxies. A zero mode existing on the
domain wall is a massless scalar particle confined to 1+2 dimensions. At
distances much larger than the galaxy/wall thickness, the zero-mode exchange
generates a logarithmic potential, acting as an additional term with respect to
Newton's gravity. The logarithmic term naturally leads to constant rotational
velocities at the periphery. We estimate the scalar field coupling to the

symmetry is broken at the quantum level by the confinement of

allows to estimate the critical temperature $T_c$, so that for $T > T_c$ mass

Renormalization Group technique to the problem of ferro- and
antiferromagnetically coupled Ising spins with local anisotropy axes in
geometrically frustrated geometries (kagome and pyrochlore lattices). In this
framework, we calculate the various ground states of these systems and the
corresponding critical points. Excellent agreement is found with exact and
Monte Carlo results. The effects of frustration are discussed. As pointed out
by other authors, it turns out that the spin ice model can be exactly mapped to
the standard Ising model but with effective interactions of the opposite sign
to those in the original Hamiltonian. Therefore, the ferromagnetic spin ice is
frustrated, and does not order. Antiferromagnetic spin ice (in both 2 and 3
dimensions), is found to undergo a transition to a long range ordered state.
The thermal and magnetic critical exponents for this transition are calculated.
It is found that the thermal exponent is that of the Ising universality class,
whereas the magnetic critical exponent is different, as expected from the fact
that the Zeeman term has a different symmetry in these systems. In addition,
the recently introduced Generalized Constant Coupling method is also applied to
the calculation of the critical points and ground state configurations. Again,
a very good agreement is found with both exact, Monte Carlo, and
renormalization group calculations for the critical points. Incidentally, we
show that the generalized constant coupling approach can be regarded as the
lowest order limit of the EFRG technique, in which correlations outside a
frustrated unit are neglected, and scaling is substituted by strict equality of
the thermodynamic quantities.

decreasing $\kappa$ for a superconductor-insulator boundary condition ($(\nabla

induce a reinforcement of the surface barrier at fields greater than the first

be related to the superconducting condensation energy by Scalapino and White.

  Hilbert's Program","44 pp",,,,"math.LO math.HO",,"  After a brief flirtation with logicism in 1917-1920, David Hilbert proposed
his own program in the foundations of mathematics in 1920 and developed it, in
concert with collaborators such as Paul Bernays and Wilhelm Ackermann,
throughout the 1920s. The two technical pillars of the project were the
development of axiomatic systems for ever stronger and more comprehensive areas
of mathematics and finitistic proofs of consistency of these systems. Early
advances in these areas were made by Hilbert (and Bernays) in a series of
lecture courses at the University of Goettingen between 1917 and 1923, and
notably in Ackermann's dissertation of 1924. The main innovation was the
invention of the epsilon-calculus, on which Hilbert's axiom systems were based,
and the development of the epsilon-substitution method as a basis for
consistency proofs. The paper traces the development of the ""simultaneous
development of logic and mathematics"" through the epsilon-notation and provides
an analysis of Ackermann's consistency proofs for primitive recursive
arithmetic and for the first comprehensive mathematical system, the latter
using the substitution method. It is striking that these proofs use transfinite
induction not dissimilar to that used in Gentzen's later consistency proof as
well as non-primitive recursive definitions, and that these methods were
accepted as finitistic at the time.

electrically-driven convection in a freely suspended film. A weakly conducting,
submicron thick smectic liquid crystal film was supported by concentric
circular electrodes. It electroconvected when a sufficiently large voltage $V$
was applied between its inner and outer edges. The film could sustain rapid
flows and yet remain strictly two-dimensional. By rotation of the inner
electrode, a circular Couette shear could be independently imposed. The control
parameters were a dimensionless number ${\cal R}$, analogous to the Rayleigh
number, which is $\propto V^2$ and the Reynolds number ${\cal R}e$ of the
azimuthal shear flow. The geometrical and material properties of the film were
characterized by the radius ratio $\alpha$, and a Prandtl-like number ${\cal
P}$. Using measurements of current-voltage characteristics of a large number of
films, we examined the onset of electroconvection over a broad range of
$\alpha$, ${\cal P}$ and ${\cal R}e$. We compared this data quantitatively to
the results of linear stability theory. This could be done with essentially no
adjustable parameters. The current-voltage data above onset were then used to
infer the amplitude of electroconvection in the weakly nonlinear regime by
fitting them to a steady-state amplitude equation of the Landau form. We show
how the primary bifurcation can be tuned between supercritical and subcritical
by changing $\alpha$ and ${\cal R}e$.

Coulomb gauge in the dipole approximation and calculate the shift of atomic
energy levels in the context of Dalibard, Dupont-Roc and Cohen-Tannoudji (DDC)
formalism by considering the variation rates of physical observables. We then
analyze the physical interpretation of the ordering of operators in the dipole
approximation interaction Hamiltonian in terms of field fluctuations and
self-reaction of atomic eletrons, discussing the arbitrariness in the
statistical functions in second order bound-state perturbation theory.

collision with a condensed deuterium target is expressed in terms of a
single-particle response function. In particular, $dd\mu$ formation in solid
deuterium at low pressures is considered. Numerical calculations of the rate in
the case of fcc polycrystalline deuterium at 3 K have been performed using the
isotropic Debye model of solid. It is shown that the energy-dependent $dd\mu$
formation rates in the solid differ strongly from those obtained for D$_2$
gaseous targets, even at high $d\mu$ kinetic energies. Monte Carlo neutron
spectra from $dd$ fusion in $dd\mu$ molecules have been obtained for solid
targets with different concentrations of ortho-D$_2$ and para-D$_2$. The
neutron time spectra calculated for pure ortho-D$_2$ and para-D$_2$ targets are
very similar.

"physics/0102081","Eric Altschuler","Eric Lewin Altschuler","Why the 3D Writhe of Ideal Knots and Links Is Quantized and Additive",,,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Besides mathematical interest, knots and knot theory have important
applications in physics, chemistry, and biology. Stasiak and colleagues devised
a constructive method for a knot ""energy"" using a Metropolis Monte Carlo
algorithm to minimize the length of rope needed to realize a given knot for a
rope of a fixed diameter. They called the resulting rendering of the knot the
""ideal"" configuration. They have found (i) that the 3-dimensional (3D) writhe
of the ideal configuration of a knot appeared, empirically, to be quantized;
(ii) empirically, the 3D writhe of the ideal configuration was additive over
composition of knots; and (iii) the 3D writhe of ideal configuration of
alternating knots (which have a projection in which crossings alternate between
over and under as one transverses the knot in a fixed direction) seems to be
equal, to 1*T + 3/7*(W-B), where T is the ""Tait number,"" and W and B are the
number of the white and black regions in the checkerboard coloring of the knot.
It is still not clear why properties i-iii might be true. Here I show that all
these empirical findings can be related to the fact that T and W-B can be
proven to be additive over composition of alternating knots. In particular, (1)
the 3D writhe of ideal configurations is likely only to be additive for
composition of alternating knots, and (2) remarkably, the geometrical structure
of all alternating (even prime) knots is determined by the three smallest
knots.

existence of a basis of product states of a bipartite system with manifest
non-local properties. In particular these states cannot be completely
discriminated by means of bilocal measurements. In this paper we propose an
optical realization of these states and we will show that they cannot be
completely discriminate by means of a global measurement using only optical
linear elements, conditional transformation and auxiliary photons.

Lett. 87, 170405 (2001)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.170405",,"quant-ph",,"  We show that the basic dynamical rules of quantum physics can be derived from
its static properties and the condition that superluminal communication is
forbidden. More precisely, the fact that the dynamics has to be described by
linear completely positive maps on density matrices is derived from the
following assumptions: (1) physical states are described by rays in a Hilbert
space, (2) probabilities for measurement outcomes at any given time are
calculated according to the usual trace rule, (3) superluminal communication is
excluded. This result also constrains possible non-linear modifications of
quantum physics.
