universe places on warm dark matter (WDM) dominated cosmological models. We
modify the extended Press-Schechter formalism to derive the halo mass function
in WDM models. We show that our predictions agree with recent numerical
simulations at low redshift over the halo masses of interest. Applying our
model to galaxy formation at high redshift, we find that the loss of power on
small scales, together with the delayed collapse of low-mass objects, results
in strong limits on the root-mean-square velocity dispersion v_rms of the WDM
particles at z=0. For fermions decoupling while relativistic, these limits are
equivalent to constraints on the mass m_X of the particles. The presence of a 4
billion solar mass black hole at z=5.8, believed to power the quasar SDSS
1044-1215, implies m_X > 0.5 keV (or v_rms < 0.10 km/s), assuming that the
quasar is unlensed and radiating at or below the Eddington limit. Reionization
by z=5.8 also implies a limit on m_X. If high-redshift galaxies produce
ionizing photons with an efficiency similar to their z=3 counterparts, we find
m_X > 1.2 keV (or v_rms < 0.03 km/s). However, given the uncertainties in
current measurements from the proximity effect of the ionizing background at
redshift 3, values of m_X as low as 0.75 keV (v_rms = 0.06 km/s) are not ruled
out. The limit weakens further if, instead, the ionizing-photon production
efficiency is greater at high z, but this limit will tighten considerably if
reionization is shown in the future to have occurred at higher redshifts. WDM
models with m_X < 1 keV (v_rms > 0.04 km/s) produce a low-luminosity cutoff in
the high-redshift galaxy luminosity function which is directly detectable with
the Next Generation Space Telescope (abridged).

Absorption Line Quasar (BALQSO) PHL 5200. This is the best X-ray spectrum of a
BALQSO yet. We find that (1) the source is not intrinsically X-ray weak, (2)
the line of sight absorption is very strong with N_H=5 x 10^{23} cm^{-2}, (3)
the absorber does not cover the source completely; the covering fraction is
about 90%. This is consistent with the large optical polarization observed in
this source, implying multiple lines of sight. The most surprising result of
this observation is that (4) the spectrum of this BALQSO is not exactly similar
to other radio-quiet quasars. The hard X-ray spectrum of PHL 5200 is steep with
the power-law spectral index alpha ~1.5. This is similar to the steepest hard
X-ray slopes observed so far. At low redshifts, such steep slopes are observed
in narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies, believed to be accreting at a high Eddington
rate. This observation strengthens the analogy between BALQSOs and NLS1
galaxies and supports the hypothesis that BALQSOs represent an early
evolutionary state of quasars (Mathur 2000). It is well accepted that the
orientation to the line of sight determines the appearance of a quasar; age
seems to play a significant role as well.

indicated by recent numerical mean field studies, that the thermodynamic

a single coupling as in a homogeneous model, but can be fit well by a
two-component model with a temperature dependent number of ``strongly'' and

a minimal model for the interpretation of experimental measurements of
thermodynamic quantities in III-V DMS systems.
