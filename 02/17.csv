applied to simulated XMM images. All significant instrumental effects are taken
into account, and two kinds of sources are considered -- unresolved sources
represented by the telescope PSF and extended ones represented by a b-profile
model. Different sets of test cases with controlled and realistic input
configurations are constructed in order to analyze the influence of confusion
on the source analysis and also to choose the best methods and strategies to
resolve the difficulties.
  In the general case of point-like and extended objects the mixed approach of
multiresolution (wavelet) filtering and subsequent detection by SExtractor
gives the best results. In ideal cases of isolated sources, flux errors are
within 15-20%. The maximum likelihood technique outperforms the others for
point-like sources when the PSF model used in the fit is the same as in the
images. However, the number of spurious detections is quite large.
  The classification using the half-light radius and SExtractor stellarity
index is succesful in more than 98% of the cases. This suggests that average
luminosity clusters of galaxies (L_[2-10] ~ 3x10^{44} erg/s) can be detected at
redshifts greater than 1.5 for moderate exposure times in the energy band below
5 keV, provided that there is no confusion or blending by nearby sources.
  We find also that with the best current available packages, confusion and
completeness problems start to appear at fluxes around 6x10^{-16} erg/s/cm^2 in
[0.5-2] keV band for XMM deep surveys.

covering the energy range 0.1-200 keV. The presence of flares in the light
curve indicates that the source was in the flaring branch during the BeppoSAX
observation. We accumulated energy spectra separately for the non-flaring
intervals and the flares. In both cases the continuum is well described by a
soft blackbody ($k T_{BB} \sim 0.5$ keV) and a Comptonized spectrum
corresponding to an electron temperature of $k T_e \sim 2.7$ keV, optical depth
$\tau \sim 10$ (for a spherical geometry), and seed photon temperature of $k
T_W \sim 1$ keV. All temperatures tend to increase during the flares. In the
non-flaring emission a hard tail dominates the spectrum above 30 keV. This can
be fit by a power law with photon index $\sim 2$, contributing $\sim 2%$ of the
total source luminosity over the BeppoSAX energy range. A comparison with hard
tails detected in some soft states of black hole binaries suggests that a
similar mechanism could originate these components in black hole and neutron
star systems.

have been undertaken in the past to detect chromospheric activity from the

X-ray flare from this object was detected. Here we report on the discovery of
quiescent and flaring radio emission from this source, which represents the
first detection of persistent radio emission from a brown dwarf, with
luminosities that are several orders of magnitude larger than predicted from an
empirical relation between the X-ray and radio luminosities of many stellar
types. We show in the context of synchrotron emission, that LP944-20 possesses
an unusually weak magnetic field in comparison to active dwarf M stars, which

this source, and the deviation from the empirical relations.

subject of intensive research due to recent interest in electron transfer
phenomena underlying the operation of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM)

view of electron transfer between donor and acceptor species give rise to a
novel view of the molecule as a current carrying conductor, and observables
such as electron transfer rates and yields are replaced by the conductivities,
or more generally by current-voltage relationships, in molecular junctions.
  In this paper I review the current knowledge and understanding of this field,
with particular emphasis on theoretical issues. Different approaches to
computing the conduction properties of molecules and molecular assemblies are
reviewed, and the relationships between them are discussed. Following a
detailed discussion of static junctions models, a review of our current
understanding of the role played by inelastic processes, dephasing and thermal
relaxation effects, is provided. The most important molecular environment for
electron transfer and transmission is water, and our current theoretical
understanding of electron transmission through water layers is reviewed.
Finally, a brief discussion of overbarrier transmission, exemplified by
photoemission through adsorbed molecular layers or low energy electron
transmission through such layers is provided. Similarities and differences
between the different systems studied are discussed.

(RE) bubbles introduced by Blanchard and Watson in the economic literature.
First, bubbles are argued to be the equivalent of Goldstone modes of the
fundamental rational pricing equation, associated with the symmetry-breaking
introduced by non-vanishing dividends. Generalizing bubbles in terms of
multiplicative stochastic maps, we summarize the result of Lux and Sornette
that the no-arbitrage condition imposes that the tail of the return
distribution is hyperbolic with an exponent mu<1. We then extend the RE bubble
model to arbitrary dimensions d and, with the renewal theory for products of
random matrices applied to stochastic recurrence equations, we extend the
theorem of Lux and Sornette to demonstrate that the tails of the unconditional
distributions follow power laws, with the same asymptotic tail exponent mu<1
for all assets. Two extensions (the crash hazard rate model and the
non-stationary growth rate model) of the RE bubble model provide ways of
reconciliation with the stylized facts of financial data. The later model
allows for an understanding of the breakdown of the fundamental valuation
formula as deeply associated with a spontaneous breaking of the price symmetry.
Its implementation for multi-dimensional bubbles explains why the tail index mu
seems to be the same for any group af assets as observed empirically. This work
begs for the introduction of a generalized field theory which would be able to
capture the spontaneous breaking of symmetry, recover the fundamental valuation
formula in the normal economic case and extend it to the still unexplored
regime where the economic growth rate is larger than the discount growth rate.

compaction for our choice of the differential rotational law. Combined with our
earlier findings based on simulations in full general relativity for stars with
higher compaction, we conclude that relativistic gravitation enhances the
dynamical bar-mode instability, i.e. the onset of instability sets in for
smaller values of $\beta$ in relativistic gravity than in Newtonian gravity. We
also find that once a triaxial structure forms after the bar-mode perturbation
saturates in dynamically unstable stars, the triaxial shape is maintained, at
least for several rotational periods. To check the reliability of our numerical
integrations, we verify that the general relativistic Kelvin-Helmholtz
circulation is well-conserved, in addition to rest-mass and total mass-energy,
linear and angular momentum. Conservation of circulation indicates that our
code is not seriously affected by numerical viscosity. We determine the
amplitude and frequency of the quasi-periodic gravitational waves emitted
during the bar formation process using the quadrupole formula.

generalizations non-extremal solutions have to be considered, and in the high

pairing correlations together with the coupling to the continuum. We apply it
to the $^{120}$Sn nucleus and show that low-lying excitation modes are
significantly influenced by the pairing effects although the effects are
marginal in the giant resonance region. The dependence of the pairing effect on
the parity of low-lying collective mode is also discussed.

fluid-particle acceleration to rms viscous acceleration is an alternative to
R-lambda which has the advantage of being determined by the small scales of
turbulence. This ratio, denoted R-a, has the following attributes: it is a
Reynolds number, it is composed of statistics of the small scales of
turbulence, it can be evaluated with single-wire hot-wire anemometry, and like
R-lambda, can be partially evaluated by means of flow similarity. For isotropic
turbulence the relationship between R-a and R-lambda is shown. Velocity
derivative flatness measured between counter-rotating blades appears monotonic

Mechanics by dividing Quantum Theory in two parts: - General Quantum Axiomatics
(a system is described by a state in a Hilbert space, observables are
self-adjoint operators and so on) - Quantum Mechanics properly that specifies
the Hilbert space, the Heisenberg rule, the free Hamiltonian... We show that
General Quantum Axiomatics (up to a supplementary ""axiom of classicity"") can be
used as a non-standard mathematical ground to formulate all the ideas and
equations of ordinary Classical Statistical Mechanics. So the question of a
""true quantization"" with ""h"" must be seen as an independent problem not
directly related with quantum formalism. Moreover, this non-standard
formulation of Classical Mechanics exhibits a new kind of operation with no
classical counterpart: this operation is related to the ""quantization process"",
and we show why quantization physically depends on group theory (Galileo
group). This analytical procedure of quantization replaces the ""correspondence
principle"" (or canonical quantization) and allows to map Classical Mechanics
into Quantum Mechanics, giving all operators of Quantum Mechanics and
Schrodinger equation. Moreover spins for particles are naturally generated,
including an approximation of their interaction with magnetic fields. We find
also that this approach gives a natural semi-classical formalism: some exact
quantum results are obtained only using classical-like formula. So this
procedure has the nice property of enlightening in a more comprehensible way
both logical and analytical connection between classical and quantum pictures.

as a very clean setting in which to study the quantum and classical dynamics of
a nonlinear system with multiple degrees of freedom. In this system,
entanglement at the quantum level and chaos at the classical level arise from
nonseparable couplings between the atomic spin and its center of mass motion.
The main features of the chaotic dynamics are analyzed using action-angle
variables and Poincare surfaces of section. We show that for the initial state
prepared in current experiments [D. J. Haycock et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 85,
3365 (2000)], the classical and quantum dynamics diverge, and the observed
experimental dynamics are best described by quantum mechanics. Furthermore, the
motion corresponds to tunneling through a dynamical potential barrier. The
coupling between the spin and the motional subsystems, which are very different
in nature from one another, leads to new questions regarding the transition
from regular quantum dynamics to chaotic classical motion.

ions and the state |down down down down> + |up up up up> for four ions. We
generate the entanglement deterministically in each shot of the experiment.
Measurements on the two-ion entangled state violates Bell's inequality at the
$8\sigma$ level. Because of the high detector efficiency of our apparatus, this
experiment closes the detector loophole for Bell's inequality measurements for
the first time. This measurement is also the first violation of Bell's
inequality by massive particles that does not implicitly assume results from
quantum mechanics. Finally, we have demonstrated reversible encoding of an
arbitrary qubit, originally contained in one ion, into a decoherence-free
subspace (DFS) of two ions. The DFS-encoded qubit resists applied collective
dephasing noise and retains coherence under ambient conditions 3.6 times longer
than does an unencoded qubit. The encoding method, which uses single-ion gates
and the two-ion entangling gate, demonstrates all the elements required for
two-qubit universal quantum logic.

$\Delta_E^2$ as the variance of the strength function. The conventional
exponential linear dependence $W(t)=C\exp (-\Gamma t)$ formally arises for a
