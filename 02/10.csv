clusters. The spatial distribution of the cluster main constituents is
described by a perturbative approach. Assuming the hydrostatic equilibrium and
the equation of state, we are able to deduce, from observations, maps of
projected gas density and gas temperature. The method then naturally entails a
X-ray emissivity prediction which can be compared to observed X-ray emissivity
maps. When tested on simulated clusters (noise free), this prediction turns out
to be in very good agreement with the simulated surface brightness. The
simulated and predicted surface brightness images have a correlation
coefficient higher than 0.9 and the total flux differ by 0.9 % or 9 % in the
two simulated clusters we studied. The method should be easily used on real
data in order to provide a physical description of the cluster physics and of
its constituents. The tests performed show that we can recover the amount and
the spatial distributions of both the baryonic and non-baryonic material with
an accuracy better than 10 %. So, in principle, in it might indeed help to
alleviate some well known bias affecting, eg baryon fraction measurements.

outburst phase of the X-ray transient J1550-564. Using the PCA and HEXTE
instruments, we find that the 3-200 keV spectra smoothly pass from a standard
low/hard state to a very high state. The classic high state is never
encountered possibly indicating that it is not a phenomenon of the rise phase.
We find that the individual PCA spectra can be fitted adequately by a disk
black body and a thermal Comptonization model which includes reflection. Once
the very high state is reached there is clear spectral curvature of the
continuum which possibly indicates the presence of a composite
thermal/non-thermal plasma. Detailed modelling of the reflection parameters
shows a sharp increase in mean ionization at the onset of the transition
between the low state and very high state. There is a related variability in
the reflected fraction but its exact value depends on the continuum model used.
We can constrain the inner radius using relativistic smearing and while there
are large uncertainties, the data are incompatible with a disk extending to the
last stable orbit in either state. Since the system is on the rise to outburst,
the disk instability models strongly imply that there is no standard inner disk
at the time the low state spectrum is observed. This is compatible with a
truncated disk, filled by an X-ray hot, advection dominated accretion flow.
However, magnetic flares above the outbursting disk can also match the observed
spectra once the effects of either outflow and/or strong photoionization of the
surface of the disk are included.

associated with the self-gravity of the disk is expected to affect not only the
momentum transport, but also the relevant energy balance equations, which could
differ substantially from the non-self-gravitating case. Here we follow the
picture that, when the disk is sufficiently cold, the stirring due to
Jeans-related instabilities acts as a source of effective heating. The
corresponding reformulation of the energy equations allows us to: ({\it i})
demonstrate how self-regulation can be established, so that the stability
parameter $Q$ is maintained close to a threshold value, with weak dependence on
radius; ({\it ii}) rediscuss the opacity properties in the self-gravitating
regime. In particular, we show that, if cooling is dominated by {\it
bremsstrahlung}, an optically thin stationary accretion solution is thermally
stable, even in the non-advective case, provided the disk is self-gravitating.
The details of the cooling function have little effect on the structure of such
accretion disk, which is in any case brought by self-gravity to self-regulate.
This condition of self-gravitating accretion is expected to be appropriate for
the outer regions of many disks of astrophysical interest. With the
reformulation of the energy equations described in this paper we have also
secured: ({\it iii}) a starting point for the study of the emission properties
of self-gravitating accretion disks; ({\it iv}) a tool to analyze the structure
of the transition region, where the disk becomes self-gravitating.

and after that it is followed by a much steeper decay with constant -3.2 +/-
0.2, the fastest one ever seen in a GRB OA. A negative detection in several
all-sky films taken simultaneously to the event implies either a previous
additional break prior to 2 d after the occurrence of the GRB (as expected from
the jet effect). The existence of a second break might indicate a steepening in
the electron spectrum or the superposition of two events. Once the afterglow
emission vanished, contribution of a bright underlying SN is found, but the

accumulated material is unmagnetized, and calculate the rate at which the
intrinsic stellar magnetic flux is transported into it by Ohmic diffusion. We
calculate the one-dimensional steady-state magnetic field profiles, and show
that the magnetic field strength decreases as one moves up through the outer
crust and ocean by roughly (Mdot/0.02 Mdot_Edd) orders of magnitude, where Mdot
is the accretion rate and Mdot_Edd the Eddington accretion rate. We show that
buoyancy instabilities set a limit to the strength of any buried field of
roughly 10^10-10^11 G.
  Our results show that magnetic screening is ineffective for Mdot<0.01
Mdot_Edd, so that, no matter how the accreted material joins onto the star, the
underlying stellar field should always be evident. In this respect, we point
out the only known persistently-pulsing accreting X-ray millisecond pulsar, SAX
J1808.4-3658, has an accretion rate of 10^-3 Mdot_Edd, far below the regime
where magnetic screening can play a role.
  Most steadily accreting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries in our
Galaxy accrete at rates where screening would be effective if the simplified
magnetic and accretion geometry we adopt were correct. If screened, then the
underlying field will emerge after accretion halts, on a timescale of only
100--1000 years, set by the Ohmic diffusion time across the outer crust. It
thus seems unlikely that screening alone can explain the low magnetic fields of
the millisecond radio pulsars.

NACRE are treated as 1\sigma limits, the resulting BBN error budget is similar
to those of previous tabulations. We propose two new procedures for deriving
reaction rate uncertainties from the nuclear data: one which sets lower limits
to the error, and one which we believe is a reasonable description of the
present error budget. We propagate these uncertainty estimates through the BBN
code, and find that when the nuclear data errors are described most accurately,
the resulting light element uncertainties are notably smaller than in some
previous tabulations, but larger than others. Using these results, we derive
limits on the cosmic baryon-to-photon ratio $\eta$, and compare this to
independent limits on $\eta$ from recent balloon-borne measurements of the

of four with respect to solar abundances, and shows a spatial gradient of
elemental abundance: the spatial distribution of iron is more compact than that
of the lighter elements. The gas mass and elemental abundance of the X-ray
emission support the long-standing hypothesis that Sgr A East is a supernova
remnant (SNR), maybe produced by the Type II supernova explosion of a massive
star with a main-sequence mass of 13--20 M$_\odot$. The combination of the
radio and X-ray morphologies classifies Sgr A East as a new metal-rich ``mixed
morphology'' (MM) SNR. The size of the Sgr A East radio shell is the smallest
of the known MM SNRs, which strongly suggests that the ejecta have expanded
into a very dense interstellar medium. The ejecta-dominated chemical
compositions of the plasma indicate that the ambient materials should be highly
homogeneous. The relation between Sgr A East and the massive blackhole Sgr A*
is discussed.

calculate the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission. The predicted
spectrum provides an excellent fit to the radio spectrum and the the X-ray
observations. Limits on the infrared flux and the low X-ray flux require a
high-energy cut-off in the electron spectrum at gamma_e ~< 100. The implied
lack of a significant power-law tail of high-energy electrons also suppresses
the appearance of the extended, optically thin radio emission usually seen in
astrophysical jets. The jet therefore appears rather compact and naturally
satisfies current VLBI limits. The initial parameters of the model are tightly
constrained by the radio spectrum and the ""submm-bump"" in particular. While the
jet most likely is coupled to some kind of accretion flow, we suggest that the
most visible signatures can be produced by this outflow. If SSC emission from
the jet contributes to the Sgr A* spectrum, significant variability in X-rays
would be expected. The model could be generic for other low-luminosity AGN or
even X-ray binaries.

boundary layers (VBLs) that can form in neutron stars at the crust-core
interface, and it investigates the VBL damping of the gravitational-radiation
driven r-mode instability. Approximate solutions to the magnetohydrodynamic
equations valid in the VBL are found for ordinary-fluid neutron stars. It is
shown that magnetic fields above 10^9 Gauss significantly change the structure
of the VBL, and that magnetic fields decrease the VBL damping time.
Furthermore, VBL damping completely suppresses the r-mode instability for B >=
10^{12} Gauss. Thus, magnetic fields will profoundly affect the VBL damping of
the r-mode instability in hot young pulsars (that are cool enough to have
formed a solid crust). One can speculate that magnetic fields can affect the
VBL damping of this instability in LMXBs and other cold old pulsars (if they
have sufficiently large internal fields).

Gell-Mann$-$Oakes$-$Renner (GOR) relation by constructing QCD sum rules
exclusively for pseudoscalar mesons from the axial-vector correlation function,
$i \int d^4x~ e^{ip\cdot x} < 0| T[A_\mu (x) A_\nu (0)] | 0>$. To project out
the pseudoscalar meson contributions, we apply $-p^\mu p^\nu/p^2$ to this
correlation function and construct sum rules for the decay constants of
pseudoscalar mesons, $f_\pi, f_k$ and $f_{\eta_8}$. The OPE is proportional to
quark masses due to PCAC. To leading order in quark mass, each sum rule
reproduces the corresponding GOR relation. For kaon and $\eta_8$, the deviation
from the GOR relation due to higher orders in quark mass is found to be
substantial. But the deviation gives better agreements with the phenomenology.
Our sum rule provides a sensitive relation between $f_K$ and $m_s$, which
stringently constrain the value for $m_s$. To reproduce the experimental value
for $f_K$, $m_s$ is found to be 186 MeV at 1 GeV scale. The $f_{\eta_8}$ sum
rule also supports this finding.

The expression for the new analytic running coupling, independent of the

It is shown that the difference between the values of the NARC in respective
spacelike and timelike regions is rather valuable for intermediate energies.
This is essential for the correct extracting of the running coupling from

description of the inclusive $\tau$ lepton decay. The consistent estimation of
the parameter $\Lambda_{QCD}$ is obtained here.

well the associated entropy balance is given in the framework of a
deterministic dynamical system. A laminar shear flow is modeled by a
Hamiltonian multibaker map which drives velocity and temperature fields. In an
appropriate macroscopic limit one recovers the Navier-Stokes and heat
conduction equations along with the associated entropy balance. This indicates
that results of nonequilibrium thermodynamics can be described by means of an
abstract, sufficiently chaotic and mixing dynamics. A thermostating algorithm
can also be incorporated into this framework.

analyze in detail three experiments, performed at LAMPF, at TRIUMF, and at the

discussed, where we distinguish between measured and calculated normalizations.
This analysis leads to improved treatments of the LAMPF and TRIUMF data over
PWA93. It is shown that the LAMPF and TRIUMF data at Tlab = 212 MeV are in good
agreement with PWA93, that the LAMPF data at Tlab = 162 MeV is also in good
agreement with PWA93, but that the Uppsala data at 162 MeV is in strong
disagreement with PWA93. The reason for the disagreement is, almost certainly,
a systematic flaw in the slope of the Uppsala data.

Bohr's reply, but further work is needed. In this paper I do two things towards
that end. First, I make some elementary points about EPR's argument, which help
to clear the air of some minor criticisms of Bohr's reply. Second, I argue that
Bohr's thought experiment is a reasonable realization of EPR's argument, and I
briefly suggest how to understand that experiment. I finish with a brief remark
about Bohm's version of the experiment, and its relation to Bohr's.

the notion of QPA in a non-equivalent way, including unitarity criteria, by
using the definition of quantum finite automata of Kondacs and Watrous. It is
established that the unitarity criteria of QPA are not equivalent to the
corresponding unitarity criteria of quantum Turing machines. We show that QPA
can recognize every regular language. Finally we present some simple languages
recognized by QPA, not recognizable by deterministic pushdown automata.

coupled to a dissipative environment. Our theory includes a vector potential
which mixes forward and backwards propagating components and non-local quantum
potential which continuously produces coherences in the system. These
trajectories are then used to propagate an adaptive Lagrangian grid which
carries the density matrix, $\rho(x,y)$, and the action, $A(x,y)$, thereby
providing a complete hydrodynamic-like description of the dynamics.
