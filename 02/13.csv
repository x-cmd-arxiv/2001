efficient than the results from previous, simpler calculations (Takeda et al.

cluster elliptical galaxies. Hydrodynamic torques and direct accretion of
orbital angular momentum can result in the formation of a cold gaseous disk,
even in a non-rotating galaxy. The gas lost by cluster galaxies via the process
of gas dynamic stripping tends to produce a colder, chemically enriched cluster
gas core. A comparison of the models with the available X-ray data of cluster
galaxies shows that the X-ray luminosity distribution of cluster galaxies may
reflect hydrodynamic stripping, but also that a purely hydrodynamic treatment
is inadequate for the cooler interstellar medium near the centre of the galaxy.

break galaxy MS1512-cB58 resulted in a 3 sigma upper limit of 3.9 mJy at 850um.
A comparison of this upper limit with values expected from rest-UV/optical
measurements of extiction suggests that dust temperature (T_d) and/or
emissivity index (beta) in cB58 may be substantially higher than is seen in
local galaxies, or that the attenuation curve in cB58 may be even gentler than
the already quite mild SMC dust law. If dust temperature T_d and emissivity
index beta in cB58 are similar to those seen in local IRAS-seleceted galaxies,
then cB58's dust mass is M_d <~ 10^7.7 Msun and its star formation rate is SFR
<~ 10 Msun/yr (for q_0=0.1, H_0=75 km/s/Mpc). This SFR upper limit is lower
than the star formation rate measured from Halpha, thus giving further support
to the notion that (T_d, beta) values in cB58 are higher than those seen in
local galaxies. It thus appears that our understanding of dust in this
extensively studied Lyman break galaxy is poor, and observations at other
wavelentghs are needed to better understand dust at high redshift. Such
observations can be provided by the upcoming SIRTF mission for which cB58's
expected flux densities are calculated.

average surface brightness, linear radius, and absolute magnitude. The purpose
is to calibrate the correlations between these three parameters in the limit of
zero redshift. These local correlations provide the comparisons to be made in
Paper IV with the sample of early-type galaxies at high redshift in search of
the Tolman surface brightness signal of (1 + z)^4 if the expansion is real.
Surface brightness averages are calculated at various metric radii in each
galaxy in the sample. The definition of such radii by Petrosian (1976, ApJ,
209, L1) uses ratios of observed surface photometric data. The observed surface
brightnesses are listed for 118 first ranked cluster galaxies at Petrosian eta

show that, although recipes from the standard cosmological model that already

absolute magnitudes from the observed data, the test is nevertheless free from
the hermeneutical circularity dilemma occasionally claimed in the literature.
The reasons are the observed mean surface brightness (1) is independent of any
assumptions of cosmological model, (2) does not depend on the existence of a
Tolman signal because it is calculated directly from the data using only
angular radii and apparent magnitudes, and (3) can be used to search for the

three high-redshift galaxies in the cluster Cl 1324 + 3011 (z = 0.76) made both

that is approximately ten times smaller. The conclusion is that HST data can be
used as far into the galaxy image as a Petrosian metric radius of eta = 1.3
magnitudes, whereas the ground-based data will have systematic errors of up to
2.9 magnitudes in the mean surface brightness at eta values of less than 2.2

surface brightness for nearly circular galaxy images compared with highly
flattened images. The comparison is made by using the two reduction procedures

approximating an ``equivalent circular'' galaxy that is highly elongated by
using an ``effective'' radius of sqrt{ab}, where a and b are the semi-major and
semi-minor axis, respectively, of the best-fitting ellipse. The conclusion is
that the two methods of reduction give nearly identical results and that either
method can be used to analyze the low and high-redshift galaxy samples used in

that the infrared emission from the majority of non-Mira stars cannot be

models can be altered to fit the data for non-Mira stars by postulating
non-standard optical properties for silicate grains, or by assuming that the
dust temperature at the inner envelope radius is significantly lower (300-400
K) than typical silicate grain condensation temperatures (800-1000 K). We argue
that the latter is more probable and provide detailed model fits to the IRAS
LRS spectra for 342 stars. These fits imply that 2/3 of non-Mira stars and 1/3
of Mira stars do not have hot dust ($>$ 500 K) in their envelopes. The absence
of hot dust can be interpreted as a recent (order of 100 yr) decrease in the
mass-loss rate. The distribution of best-fit model parameters agrees with this
interpretation and strongly suggests that the mass loss resumes on similar time
scales. Such a possibility appears to be supported by a number of spatially
resolved observations (e.g. recent HST images of the multiple shells in the Egg

the line. The ionized skin appears as a result of the thermal instability of
X-ray irradiated plasma. We test this hypothesis by computing the Thomson
thickness of the hot skin on top of the 'alpha P_tot' Shakura-Sunyaev disc, by
simultaneously solving the vertical structure of both the hot skin and the

the hard X-ray flux, amplitude of the observed reprocessed component,
relativistic smearing of the K alpha line, the r.m.s. variability of the hard
X-rays. These relations can be compared to present and future observations. We

of Lyman continuum photons from the observed HII regions can be important. As a
result, HII galaxies selected from objective-prism surveys are unlikely to
contain many objects in which the most recent starburst is older than about
5~Myr. The observed increase of [OI]/Hb with decreasing W(Hb) can result from
the dynamical effects of winds and supernovae. This interpretation provides
also a natural explanation of the small range of ionization parameters in giant

of the central questions is whether this new superconductor resembles a
high-temperature-cuprate superconductor or a low-temperature metallic
superconductor in terms of its current carrying characteristics in applied
magnetic fields. In spite of the very high transition temperatures of the
cuprate superconductors, their performance in magnetic fields has several
drawbacks[2]. Their large anisotropy restricts high bulk current densities to
much less than the full magnetic field-temperature (H-T) space over which
superconductivity is found. Further, weak coupling across grain boundaries
makes transport current densities in untextured polycrystalline forms low and
strongly magnetic field sensitive[3,4]. These studies of MgB2 address both
issues. In spite of the multi-phase, untextured, nano-scale sub-divided nature
of our samples, supercurrents flow throughout without the strong sensitivity to
weak magnetic fields characteristic of Josephson-coupled grains[3].
Magnetization measurements over nearly all of the superconducting H-T plane
show good temperature scaling of the flux pinning force, suggestive of a
current density determined by flux pinning. At least two length scales are
suggested by the magnetization and magneto optical (MO) analysis but the cause
of this seems to be phase inhomogeneity, porosity, and minority insulating
phase such as MgO rather than by weakly coupled grain boundaries. Our results
suggest that polycrystalline ceramics of this new class of superconductor will
not be compromised by the weak link problems of the high temperature
superconductors, a conclusion with enormous significance for applications if
higher temperature analogs of this compound can be discovered.

phases, we propose an intermediate weakly incommensurate spin-density wave
(WISDW) phase. The stability of the mean-field transitions is studied by
renormalization techniques in d=2, the upper critical dimension. While the
transition from the Neel phase is found to be stable, the transition point from
the dimer phase is not perturbatively accessible. We argue that the latter
renormalization results point to the possibility of an intermediate phase of a
different kind.

breakdown of the colloidal fluid <--> atomic fluid analogy. The success of
liquid state theory for atomic fluids stems in part from the van der Waals
picture, where steric interactions dominate the structure, and attractive
interactions can be added as a perturbation. For complex fluids described by
effective potentials, this picture may break down. In the first example
discussed, depletion potentials in non-additive hard-sphere mixtures are shown
to be surprisingly complex, leading to fluid structure and fluid-solid
transitions dominated by properties of the attractive potentials instead of by
the hard-cores. Many colloidal suspensions, and possibly globular proteins,
fall into this {\em energetic fluid} category. In the second example, the
coarse-graining of polymers leads to soft-core effective potentials and
associated {\em mean field fluid} behaviour distinguished by a breakdown of the
virial expansion, an equation of state that is nevertheless nearly linear in
density, and correlation functions well described by the random phase
approximation.

superconducting junction arrays for quantum computing. The interference effects
are most pronounced in arrays composed of identical junctions and possessing
geometric symmetries; they may be controlled by either external gate potentials

identical junctions encircling one half superconducting quantum of magnetic
flux. In this system, the ground state is found to be non-degenerate if the

of black hole spacetimes in semiclassical gravity and offer some thoughts on
three possible scenarios by which these transitions could take place. Our first
theme is ilustrated by a quantum atomic black hole system, generalizing to
finite-temperature a model originally offered by Bekenstein. In this
equilibrium atomic model, the black hole phase transition is realized as the
abrupt excitation of a high energy state, suggesting analogies with the study
of two-level atoms. Our second theme argues that the black hole system shares
similarities with the defect-mediated Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in
condensed matter. These similarities suggest that the black hole phase
transition may be more fully understood by focusing upon the dynamics of black
holes and white holes, the spacetime analogy of vortex and anti-vortex
topological defects. Finally we compare the black hole phase transition to
another transition driven by an exponentially increasing density of states, the
Hagedorn transition first found in hadron physics in the context of dual models
or the old string theory. In modern string theory, the Hagedorn transition is
linked by the Maldacena conjecture to the Hawking-Page black hole phase
transition in Anti-deSitter space, as observed by Witten. Understanding the
dynamics of the Hagedorn transition may thus yield insight into the dynamics of
the black hole phase transition. We argue that characteristics of the Hagedorn
transition are already contained within classical string systems where a
nonperturbative and dynamical analysis is possible.

infinity of space-times, differing as to the limiting acceleration of a
radially approaching test particle. Taking this limit to be infinite gives
Schwarzschild's result, which for a point mass at x = y = z = 0 has C(0+) =
a^2, where a = 2m and C(r) denotes the coefficient of the angular terms in the
polar form of the metric. Hilbert's derivation used the variable r*
=[C(0+)]^1/2. For Hilbert, however, C was unknown, and thus could not be used
to determine r*(0). Instead he asserted, in effect, that r* = (x^2 + y^2 +
z^2)^1/2, which places the point mass at r* = 0. Unfortunately, this differs
from the value (a) obtained by substituting Schwarzschild's C into the
expression for r*(0), and since C(0+) is a scaler invariant, it follows that
Hilbert's assertion is invalid. Owing to this error, in each spatial section of
Hilbert's space-time, the boundary (r* = a) corresponding to r = 0 is no longer
a point, but a two-sphere. This renders his space-time analytically extendible,
and as shown by Kruskal and Fronsdal, its maximal extension contains a black
hole. Thus the Kruskal-Fronsdal black hole is merely an artifact of Hilbert's
error.

with that observed on the Pioneer 10/11, Galileo, and Ulysses spacecraft. At

of this intensity is within the reach of the planned sensitivity of LISA. Since
in the Standard Model the background of gravitational waves is totally

number of extra families and their spectrum. The analysis is motivated, in
part, by recent N = 2 supersymmetry constructions, but is performed in a

contributions to the three oblique parameters, rather than the contribution to

extra chiral family with a constrained spectrum is found to be consistent with
precision data without requiring any other new physics source. Models with
three additional families may also be accommodated but only by invoking
additional new physics, most notably, a two-Higgs-doublet extension. The
interplay between the spectra of the extra fermions and the Higgs boson(s) is
analyzed in the case of either one or two Higgs doublets, and its implications

how the backward method reduces the statistical error in the common case where
the solution is of interest in only a small part of phase space. The forward
method requires binning of particles, and linear interpolation between the bins
introduces an additional error. Reducing this error by decreasing the bin size
increases the statistical error. The backward method is not afflicted by this
conflict. Finally, it is shown how the poor time convergence can be improved
for the backward method by a minor modification of the Monte-Carlo equation of
motion that governs the stochastic particle trajectories. This scheme does not
work for the conventional, forward method.

that is, a variety $X$ with ample anticanonical sheaf $\O_X(-K_X)$. From the
point of view of birational geometry they basically fall within two classes:
either $X$ is ``close to being rational'', and then it has very many
biregularly distinct birational models as a Fano 3-fold, or, at the other
extreme, $X$ has a unique model and it is often even true that every birational
selfmap of $X$ is biregular. In this paper we construct examples of singular
quartic 3-folds with exactly two birational models as Fano 3-folds.

$N$ the correspondence space $\Cal CN$, which is the total space of a fiber
bundle over $N$ with fiber a generalized flag manifold, and construct a
canonical parabolic geometry of type $(G,Q)$ on $\Cal CN$.
  Conversely, for a parabolic geometry of type $(G,Q)$ on a smooth manifold
$M$, we construct a distribution corresponding to $P$, and find the exact
conditions for its integrability. If these conditions are satisfied, then we
define the twistor space $N$ as a local leaf space of the corresponding
foliation. We find equivalent conditions for the existence of a parabolic
geometry of type $(G,P)$ on the twistor space $N$ such that $M$ is locally
isomorphic to the correspondence space $\Cal CN$, thus obtaining a complete
local characterization of correspondence spaces.
  We show that all these constructions preserve the subclass of normal
parabolic geometries (which are determined by some underlying geometric
structure) and that in the regular normal case, all characterizations can be
expressed in terms of the harmonic curvature of the Cartan connection, which is
easier to handle. Several examples and applications are discussed.

nonsingular. The result is that there indeed is such an elementary condition,

certain singular blowups, all of which can be resolved by an additional Nash
blowup.
  There is is a particular explicit sequence of ideals R=J_0, J_1, J_2,...
\subset R so that V_i=Bl_{J_i}V is the i'th Nash blowup of V, with J_i|J_{i+1}
for all i. Applying our earlier paper, V_i is nonsingular if and only if the
ideal class of J_{i+1} divides some power of the ideal class of J_i. The
present paper brings things down to earth considerably: such a divisibility of
ideal classes implies that for some N\ge r+2
J_i^{N-r-2}J_{i+1}^{r+3}=J_i^NJ_{i+2}.

Nash question is equivalent to the assertion that the identity above holds for
some sufficiently large i and N.

exponent dependent only on the number of players. For most situations, the
system converges towards a state where all players are identical. A number of
variations of this model are introduced and the application of these models to
the dynamics of market makers is discussed. The effect of price uncertainty on
bid distributions is presented. An underlying market structure generates
heterogenous agents which do not have power law bid distribution in general.

velocity profiles for the 100 and 200 metre sprints, the magnitudes of altitude
and mixed wind/altitude-assisted performances as compared to their sea-level
equivalents are presented. It is shown that altitude-assisted times for the 200
metre are significantly higher than for the 100 metre, suggesting that the
``legality'' of such marks perhaps be reconsidered.

properties of a field consisting of a coherent structure interacting with
turbulent linear waves. The explicit expression of the generating functional of
the correlations is obtained, performing the functional integration on a
neighbourhood in the function space around the soliton. The results show that
the non-gaussian fluctuations observed in the tokamak plasma edge can be
explained by the intermittent formation of nonlinear coherent structures.

  Nov. -1 Dec. 2000",,"10.1142/9789812810809_0007",,"quant-ph",,"  The discussion of the foundations of quantum mechanics is complicated by the
fact that a number of different issues are closely entangled. Three of these
issues are i) the interpretation of probability, ii) the choice between realist
and empiricist interpretations of the mathematical formalism of quantum
mechanics, iii) the distinction between measurement and preparation. It will be
demonstrated that an interpretation of violation of Bell's inequality by
quantum mechanics as evidence of non-locality of the quantum world is a
consequence of a particular choice between these alternatives. Also a
distinction must be drawn between two forms of realism, viz. a) realist
interpretations of quantum mechanics, b) the possibility of hidden-variables
(sub-quantum) theories.

shared among two parties using the same Schmidt basis, two qubits per party. In
some cases, transformation between two known pure states may not be possible
using LOCC transformations but may be possible with the addition of a two-qubit
catalyst. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for this to occur.

exact formulation of the uncertainty principle which precisely captures the
essence of what is ""quantum"" about quantum mechanics.

intuitive experimental implementations. Of particular importance is quantum
state preparation. In this thesis, the creation of polarisation entanglement
using a particular class of optical circuits is studied. I give a mathematical
description of this class of circuits in terms of Hermite polynomials. In this
context, single photon resolution and single photon sensitivity detectors are
discussed and compared with detector cascading. In addition, I study
applications of state preparation such as quantum teleportation and quantum
lithography.
