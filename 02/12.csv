microlensing events of high magnification, MACHO 98-BLG-35, MACHO 99-LMC-2, and
OGLE 00-BUL-12. Photometry was derived from observational images by the MOA and
OGLE groups using an image subtraction technique. For MACHO 98-BLG-35,
additional photometry derived from the MPS and PLANET groups was included.
Planetary modeling of the three events was carried out in a super-cluster
computing environment. The estimated probability for explaining the data on
MACHO 98-BLG-35 without a planet is <1%. The best planetary model has a planet
of mass ~(0.4-1.5) X 10^-5 M_Earth at a projected radius of either ~1.5 or ~2.3
AU. We show how multi-planet models can be applied to the data. We calculated
exclusion regions for the three events and found that Jupiter-mass planets can
be excluded with projected radii from as wide as about 30 AU to as close as
around 0.5 AU for MACHO 98-BLG-35 and OGLE 00-BUL-12. For MACHO 99-LMC-2, the
exclusion region extends out to around 10 AU and constitutes the first limit
placed on a planetary companion to an extragalactic star. We derive a
particularly high peak magnification of ~160 for OGLE 00-BUL-12. We discuss the
detectability of planets with masses as low as Mercury in this and similar
events.

with emission line ratios. An underlying population is needed, even for
small-aperture observations. This evolved population not only reddens the
continuum and dilutes the equivalent width of the emission lines, but also
participates in the ionization process. Its main effect on line ratios is to
maintain a high level of excitation when the burst stops. Models combining
underlying populations typical of Hubble sequence galaxies and instantaneous
starbursts with ages between 0 and 8 Myr agree satisfactorily with all the

compare their HI distribution to new optical R-band images and discuss their

second shows a peculiar HI distribution. The estimated 3-sigma HI mass limit of
our observations is \sim 7 x 10^8 M_{\odot} for a line width of 150 km s^{-1}.
The non-detection of a considerable number of luminous spiral galaxies

  turbulence","27 pages, 9 figures",,"10.1063/1.1425837",,"nlin.CD",,"  Scaling laws and intermittency in the wall region of a turbulent flow are
addressed by analyzing moderate Reynolds number data obtained by single
component hot wire anemometry in the boundary layer of a flat plate. The paper
aims in particular at the experimental validation of a new form of refined
similarity recently proposed for the shear dominated range of turbulence, where
the classical Kolmogorov-Oboukhov inertial range theory is inappropriate. An
approach inspired to the extended self-similarity allows for the extraction of
the different power laws for the longitudinal structure functions at several
wall normal distances. A double scaling regime is found in the logarithmic
region, confirming previous experimental results. Approaching the wall, the
scaling range corresponding to the classical cascade-dominated range tends to
disappear and, in the buffer layer, a single power law is found to describe the
available range of scales. The double scaling is shown to be associated with
two different forms of refined similarity. The classical form holds below the
shear scale L s . The other, originally introduced on the basis of DNS data for
a turbulent channel, is experimentally confirmed to set up above L s . Given
the experimental diffulties in the evaluation of the instantaneous dissipation
rate, some care is devoted to check that its one-dimensional surrogate does not
bias the results. The increased intermittency as the wall is approached is
experimentally found entirely consistent with the failure of the refined
Kolmogorov-Oboukhov similarity and the establishment of its new form near the
wall.

transfered from the contaminated raw material to the medicine. We have
presented new results of the transfer of Cs-137 from contaminated Digitalis

example 96.5%(vol.) ethyl alcohol extracts less Cs-137 (11.6%) than 40%(vol.)
ethyl alcohol or pure water (66.2%). The solubility of the cardiac glycosides
is inverse to the solubility of cesium, which may be of use in the
technological processes for manufacturing ecologically pure herbal medicine.
