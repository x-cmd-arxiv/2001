results based on optical observations, we derive complete 3-D velocity

intrinsic spin parameters of this pulsar and a characteristic age of 8.6 +/-
1.9 Gyr. Our upper limit for the orbital eccentricity of only 8 * 10^-7 (68%
C.L.) is the smallest ever measured for a binary system. We demonstrate that
this makes the pulsar an ideal laboratory to test certain aspects of
alternative theories of gravitation. Our precise measurements suggest
deviations from a simple pulsar spin-down timing model, which are consistent
with timing noise and the extrapolation of the known behaviour of slowly
rotating pulsars.

resolved absorption spectra of the gravitationally lensed quasar PKS 1830-211.
High-resolution (1.2 km/s) spectra were taken in two spectral windows centered
on the redshifted frequencies of the HCO+(2-1) and HCN(2-1) molecular
transitions. There is no molecular absorption in the northeast image but the
southwest image reveals optically thick absorbing gas at these transition
frequencies. Further analyses conclude that the spectra are consistent with
completely saturated absorption in the southwest image and the line profiles
suggest that the absorbing medium is complex, perhaps containing multiple
components and small scale structure. The absorption occurs along a pencil beam
through the lensing galaxy which is thought to be a late type spiral oriented
almost face on. However, the spectra show absorption spanning more than 60 km/s
which is difficult to explain for this scenario.

very unusual colour-magnitude diagram, so we also use our data to investigate
the reddening, distance, luminosity function and structure of this cluster. We
deduce a higher metallicity and smaller distance modulus than did some previous
studies, but emphasise that very large patchy extinction on small angular
scales prohibits accurate determination of the parameters of this cluster. The
horizontal branch of NGC6553 in ($V,V-I$) is tilted at an angle close to that
of the reddening vector. We show that extinction does not, however, explain the
tilt, which is presumably a metallicity effect. The colour-magnitude diagram
shows an apparent second turnoff some 1.5 magnitudes fainter than that of the
cluster. We show that this is most likely the background Galactic bulge:
however, in that case, the colour-magnitude diagram of NGC6553 is not a good
match to that of the field bulge population. The cluster is probably more
metal-rich than is the mean field bulge star.

those of TeV BL Lac objects, and generalize them to HBL-like FRI radio galaxies
according to the unified scheme of BL Lac objects and FRI radio galaxies. We
infer that Cen A may have a peak in its Compton component power output at

For Cen A, the estimated TeV $\gamma$-ray flux during outburst is F(0.25 $-$ 30

consider here the implication of the observed rates of GRBs to the possibility
of detection of a gravitational radiation signal associated with a GRB.
Unfortunately I find that, with currently planned detectors it is impossible to

quite unlikely to detect gravitational radiation associated with Collapsars.

to the frame. We obtain the radiation formula in the Rindler frame (the Rindler

proportional to the square of acceleration $\alpha^\mu$ of the charge relative

equations, called the Group-Variation Equations, that exhibit a simple and
robust mechanism for the emergence of massive glueballs and the Wilson area
law. The equations predict that the cylinder-topology minimal-area spanning
surface term in the two-glueball correlation function, when it exists, must be
multiplied by a pre-exponential factor, which for large area A of the
minimal-area cylinder-topology surface, decreases with increasing A at least as
fast as $1/\ln(\sigma A)$. If this factor decreases faster than $1/\ln(\sigma
A)$, then the mass $m_{0^{++}}$ of the lightest glueball, and the coefficient
$\sigma$ of the area in the Wilson area law, are determined in a precisely
parallel manner, and the equations give a zeroth-order estimate of
$m_{0^{++}}/\sqrt{\sigma}$ of 2.38, about 33% less than the best lattice value,
without the need for a full calculation of any of the terms in the right-hand
sides. The large distance behaviour of the vacuum expectation values and
correlation functions is completely determined by terms called island diagrams,
the dominant contributions to which come from islands of \emph{fixed} size of
about $1/\sqrt{\sigma}$. The value of $\sigma$ is determined by the point at
which $|\beta(g)/g|$ reaches a critical value, and since the large distance
behaviour of all physical quantities is determined by islands of the fixed size
$1/\sqrt{\sigma}$, the running coupling $g^2$ never increases beyond the value
at which $|\beta(g)/g|$ reaches the critical value.

(MQC) in a rf-SQUID qubit is to use on-chip RSFQ digital circuits for
preparing, evolving and reading out the qubit's quantum state. This approach
allows experiments to be conducted on a very short time scale (sub-nanosecond)
without the use of large bandwidth control lines that would couple
environmental degrees of freedom to the qubit thus contributing to its
decoherence. In this paper we present our design of a RSFQ digital control
circuit for demonstrating MQC in a rf-SQUID. We assess some of the key
practical issues in the circuit design including the achievement of the
necessary flux bias stability. We present an ""active"" isolation structure to be
used to increase coherence times. The structure decouples the SQUID from
external degrees of freedom, and then couples it to the output measurement
circuitry when required, all under the active control of RSFQ circuits.

  (University of Rochester)","A ""Tipping Pulse"" Scheme for rf-SQUID Qubits","4 pages. More information and publications at
  http://www.ece.rochester.edu:8080/users/sde/research/publications/index.html",,"10.1109/77.919522",,"quant-ph",,"  We introduce a technique to control the macroscopic quantum state of an rf
SQUID qubit. We propose to employ a stream of single flux quantum (SFQ) pulses
magnetically coupled to the qubit junction to momentarily suppresses its
critical current. This effectively lowers the barrier in the double-well
rf-SQUID potential thereby increasing the tunneling oscillation frequency
between the wells. By carefully choosing the time interval between SFQ pulses
one may accelerate the interwell tunneling rate. Thus it is possible to place
the qubit into a chosen superposition of flux states and then effectively to
freeze the qubit state. We present both numerical simulations and analytical
time-dependent perturbation theory calculations that demonstrate the technique.
Using this strategy one may control the quantum state of the rf-SQUID in a way
analogous to the \pi pulses in other qubit schemes. Research supported in part

supersymmetric quantum mechanics in order to include simultaneous scaling
transformations in both the original Hamiltonian and the intertwining operator.
It is argued that in this way one can generate potentials with more interesting
spectra than those obtained by means of the standard first-order intertwining
technique and, as an outcome, a simple engineering procedure is presented. The
harmonic oscillator potential is used in order to illustrate the previous
statements. Moreover, a matrix representation of the scaled intertwining
relationship is sketched up allowing for higher-dimensional generalizations in
the case of separable potentials

observable ${\bf N}$ has long been an open problem in quantum theory. Here we
show how to define the absolute phase observable ${\bf \Phi}\equiv |{\bf\phi}|$
by suitably restricting the Hilbert space of $x$ and $p$ like variables. This
${\bf \Phi}$ is actually the absolute value of the phase and has the correct
classical limit. A correction to the ``cosine'' ${\bf C}$ and ``sine'' ${\bf

we analyze three sets of complex potentials with real spectra, recently derived
by a potential algebraic approach based upon the complex Lie algebra sl(2, C).
This extends to the complex domain the well-known relationship between SUSYQM
and potential algebras for Hermitian Hamiltonians, resulting from their common
link with the factorization method and Darboux transformations. In the same
framework, we also generate for the first time a pair of elliptic partner
potentials of Weierstrass $\wp$ type, one of them being real and the other
imaginary and PT symmetric. The latter turns out to be quasiexactly solvable
with one known eigenvalue corresponding to a bound state. When the Weierstrass
function degenerates to a hyperbolic one, the imaginary potential becomes PT
non-symmetric and its known eigenvalue corresponds to an unbound state.
