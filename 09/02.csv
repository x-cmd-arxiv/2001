  A Symposium of Chandra Science""",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Chandra is revolutionising our understanding of the X-ray emission from
spiral galaxies. Before Chandra, detailed extragalactic studies were limited to
Local Group galaxies. We are now able to obtain detailed inventories of sources
in galaxies outside the Local Group, allowing population studies for the first
time. In this review I will first discuss some intriguing observations of
globular cluster sources in M31, then move outside the Local Group and
summarise the observational properties of sources in several spiral galaxies
(both bulge dominated and disk dominated). The X-ray colors and variability
characteristics suggest that most of these sources are accreting binaries. High
mass X-ray binaries are formed preferentially in disk galaxies. Finally, I show
that the luminosity functions of spiral galaxies can be qualitatively
understood in terms of simple population models.

small-world networks. In the model, the power spectrum of the population
difference between agents with ""1"" and ""-1"" exhibits a power-law tail:
$P(f)\sim f^{-\alpha}$. The exponent $\alpha$ does not depend explicitly on the
error rate but on the structure of the networks. Error rate enters only into
the frequency scales and thus governs the frequency range over which these
power laws can be observed. On the other hand, the exponent $\alpha$ reveals
the intricate internal structure of networks and can serve as a structure
factor to classify complex networks. The finite transmission error is shown to
provide a mechanism for the common occurrence of the power-law relation in

`soft glassy rheology' model of Sollich et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 2020

either the global stress \sigma or the local strain l. For appropiate
x=x(\sigma), it is shown that the flow curves include a region of negative
slope, around which the stress exhibits hysteresis under a cyclically varying
imposed strain rate \gd. A subclass of these x(\sigma) have flow curves that
touch the \gd=0 axis for a finite range of stresses; imposing a stress from
this range {\em jams} the system, in the sense that the strain \gamma creeps
only logarithmically with time t, \gamma(t)\sim\ln t. These same systems may
produce a finite asymptotic yield stress under an imposed strain, in a manner
that depends on the entire stress history of the sample, a phenomenon we refer
to as history--dependent jamming. In contrast, when x=x(l) the flow curves are
always monotonic, but we show that some x(l) generate an oscillatory strain
response for a range of steady imposed stresses. Similar spontaneous
oscillations are observed in a simplified model with fewer degrees of freedom.
We discuss this result in relation to the temporal instabilities observed in
rheological experiments and stick--slip behaviour found in other contexts, and
comment on the possible relationship with `delay differential equations' that
are known to produce oscillations and chaos.

structure of the OPE-derived spectral function. With naive vacuum saturation
for 4 quark operators and using lattice data for the gauge invariant scalar
quark correlator the results are far off the experimentally measured behavior.
However, using the correlation length of the gauge invariant vector quark
correlator, which is about 10 times smaller than the scalar one, the
qualitative results are rather realistic. Namely, the input of information on
the mass of the lowest resonance in one channel yields the corresponding masses
within acceptable errors in other channels. Still, the shapes of the calculated
spectral functions are considerably deformed as compared to experiment. This
may be a consequence of vacuum saturation and the truncation at a mass
dimension which is below the critical dimension from which on the asymptotic
expansion does not approximate anymore. To improve on this high-resolution
lattice information on gauge invariant $n>2$ point correlators would be needed.
Motivated by the small effective correlation length in the 4 quark
contributions the relevance of the approach for heavy quark physics, in
particular in the calculation of nonleptonic, inclusive $\Delta \Gamma$, is

nontrivial superselection charge may have very poor localisation properties
when compared to the vacuum. In this case, replacing the vacuum with a suitable
``infravacuum'' state can improve the localisability of the charges in such a
way that the Doplicher-Haag-Roberts (DHR) theory of superselection sectors is
applicable.
  As an explicit example for this phenomenon, we consider a certain class of
sectors of the free massless scalar field. These sectors carry a charge of
electric type, and the corresponding infravacuum background may be interpreted
as a cloud of infrared radiation.
  Motivated by this situation, we propose a model-independent definition of
infravacuum representations and derive some of their properties. We analyse in
particular their role as reference representations for DHR theory and
investigate to what an extent the absence of a translation invariant vector
affects the results of the DHR analysis. Special emphasis is put on the

utilizes the reduced interferometric wavelength.
