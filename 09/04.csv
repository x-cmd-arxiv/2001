observational cornerstones for testing General Relativity (G.R.).
  The main goal of this paper is to discuss how, presently, observational and
theoretical constraints may challenge Einstein's theory of gravitation
characterized by beta=gamma=1. To achieve this purpose, we will first recall
the experimental constraints upon the Eddington-Robertson parameters gamma,
beta and the observational bounds for the perihelion advance of Mercury. A
second point will address the values given, up to now, to the solar quadrupole
moment by several authors. Then, we will briefly comment why we use a recent
theoretical determination of the solar quadrupole moment, J2=(2.0 +/- 0.4)
10^{-7}, which takes into account both surfacic and internal differential
rotation, in order to compute the solar contribution to Mercury's perihelion
advance. Further on, combining bounds on gamma and J2 contributions, and taking
into account the observational data range for the perihelion shift, we will be
able to give a range of values for beta.
  Alternatively, taking into account the observed value of perihelion shift,
one can deduce a dynamical estimation of J2 in the setting of G.R. This point
is important as it provides a solar model independent estimation that can be
confronted with other determinations of J2 based upon solar theory and solar
observations (oscillation data, oblateness...).
  Finally, a glimpse at future satellite experiments will help us to understand
how stronger constraints upon the parameter space (gamma, beta, J2) as well as
a separation of the two contributions (J2, or purely relativistic) might be
expected in the future.

(2) establishing the diversity of planetary architectures and the frequency of

astronomical context for understanding whether our solar system - and its
habitable planet - is a common or a rare circumstance. Achieving our science
goals requires measuring precise spectral energy distributions for a
statistically robust sample capable of revealing evolutionary trends and the
diversity of system outcomes. Our targets have been selected from two carefully
assembled databases of solar-like stars: (1) a sample located within 50 pc of
the Sun spanning an age range from 100-3000 Myr for which a rich set of
ancillary measurements (e.g. metallicity, stellar activity, kinematics) are
available; and (2) a selection located between 15 and 180 pc and spanning ages
from 3 to 100 Myr. For stars at these distances SIRTF is capable of detecting
stellar photospheres with SNR >30 at lambda < 24 microns for our entire sample,
as well as achieving SNR >5 at the photospheric limit for over 50% of our
sample at lambda=70 microns. Thus we will provide a complete census of stars
with excess emission down to the level produced by the dust in our present-day

ekpyrotic scenario by Khoury et al. The issue has been raised recently by Lyth
who used the conventional method based on a conserved variable in the
large-scale limit, and derived different results from Khoury et al. The
calculation is straightforward in the uniform-curvature gauge where the
generated blue spectrum with suppressed amplitude survives as the final
spectrum. Whereas, although the metric fluctuations become unimportant and a
scale-invariant spectrum is generated in the zero-shear gauge the mode does not
survive the bounce, thus with the same final result. Therefore, an exponential
potential leads to a power-law expansion/contraction $a \propto |t|^p$, and the
power $p$ dictates the final power spectra of both the scalar and tensor
structures. If $p \ll 1$ as one realization of the ekpyrotic scenario suggests,
the results are $n_S -1 \simeq 2 \simeq n_T$ and the amplitude of the scalar
perturbation is suppressed relative to the one of the gravitational wave by a
factor $\sqrt{p}/2$. Both results confirm Lyth's. An observation is made on the
constraint on the dynamics of the seed generating stage from the requirement of
scale-invariant spectrum.

Telescope images and we use the SED to constrain the dust size distribution.
Model spectra are shown for different circumstellar dust models: a standard ISM
mixture and larger grain models. As compared to ISM grains, the larger dust
grain models have a shallower wavelength dependent opacity. Models with the
larger dust grains provide a good match to the currently available data, but
mid and far-IR observations are required to more tightly constrain the dust

energy and polarization of the incident light; character of the initial and

and, changes in the spectral intensity as a function of the perpendicular

decomposing this matrix element into contributions from various atomic sites

  Neimark",,,,"cond-mat.soft",,"  When two solid surfaces are brought in contact, water vapor present in the
ambient air may condense in the region of the contact to form a liquid bridge
connecting the two surfaces : this is the so-called capillary condensation.
This phenomenon has drastic consequences on the contact between solids,
modifying the macroscopic adhesion and friction properties. In this paper, we
present a survey of the work we have performed both experimentally and
theoretically to understand the microscopic foundations of the kinetics of
capillary condensation. From the theoretical point of view, we have computed
the free energy barrier associated with the condensation of the liquid from the
gas in a confined system. These calculations allow to understand the existence
of very large hysteresis, which is often associated with capillary
condensation. This results are compatible with experimental results obtained
with a surface forces apparatus in a vapor atmosphere, showing a large hysteris
of the surface energy of two parallel planes as a function of their distance.
In the second part, we present some experiments on the influence of humidity on
the avalanche angle of granular media. We show that the ageing in time of this
avalanche angle can be explained by the slow kinetics of capillary condensation
in a random confined geometry.

calculations reveal that a large variance in the contact numbers reduces the
degeneracy of the mapping between contact vectors and structures. Exact
enumeration for lengths up to N=16 on the three dimensional cubic lattice
indicates that the growth rate of number of contact vectors as a function of N
is only 3% less than that for contact maps. In particular, for compact
structures we present numerical evidence that, practically, each contact vector
corresponds to only a handful of structures. We discuss how this information

Similar to the orbital moments, the contributions of the individual atoms to
the magnetic anisotropy energy strongly depend on the position, hence, on the

commuting Killing vectors having compact spacelike orbits with T^3, S^2xS^1 or

a family of singular solutions which are asymptotically velocity dominated by
construction. In the case when the velocity is between zero and one, the
solutions depend on the maximal number of free functions. We consider the
similar case with S^2xS^1 or S^3 topology, where the main complication is the
presence of symmetry axes. We use Fuchsian techniques to show the existence of
singular solutions similar to the T^3 case. We first solve the analytic case
and then generalise to the smooth case by approximating smooth data with a
sequence of analytic data. However, for the metric to be smooth at the axes,
the velocity must be 1 or 3 there, which is outside the range where the
constructed solutions depend on the full number of free functions. A plausible
explanation is that in general a spiky feature may develop at the axis, a
situation which is unsuitable for a direct treatment by Fuchsian methods.

Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations is a wavenumber triad ({\bf k,p,q})
satisfying ${\bf k+p+q=0}$. The expression for the combined energy transfer
from two of these wavenumbers to the third wavenumber is known. In this paper
we introduce the idea of an effective energy transfer between a pair of modes
by the mediation of the third mode, and find an expression for it. Then we
apply this formalism to compute the energy transfer in the quasi-steady-state
of two-dimensional MHD turbulence with large-scale kinetic forcing. The
computation of energy fluxes and the energy transfer between different
wavenumber shells is done using the data generated by the pseudo-spectral
direct numerical simulation. The picture of energy flux that emerges is quite
complex---there is a forward cascade of magnetic energy, an inverse cascade of
kinetic energy, a flux of energy from the kinetic to the magnetic field, and a
reverse flux which transfers the energy back to the kinetic from the magnetic.
The energy transfer between different wavenumber shells is also complex---local
and nonlocal transfers often possess opposing features, i.e., energy transfer
between some wavenumber shells occurs from kinetic to magnetic, and between
other wavenumber shells this transfer is reversed. The net transfer of energy
is from kinetic to magnetic. The results obtained from the studies of flux and
shell-to-shell energy transfer are consistent with each other.

experimental capabilities and theoretical approaches are opening windows into
the richness of many-body phenomena in QCD. A common theme is the use of
effective field theory (EFT) methods, which exploit the separation of scales in
physical systems. At low energies, effective field theory can explain how
existing phenomenology emerges from QCD and how to refine it systematically.
More generally, the application of EFT methods to many-body problems promises
insight into the analytic structure of observables, the identification of new
expansion parameters, and a consistent organization of many-body corrections,
with reliable error estimates.

I_2 and relative phase phi = phi_2-phi_1 may be characterized by the 3
observables p = sqrt{I_1 I_2}, p cos\phi and -p sin\phi. They are, e.g. the
starting point for the semi-classical operational approach by Noh, Fougeres and
Mandel (NFM) to the old and notorious phase problem in quantum optics.
Following a recent group theoretical quantization of the symplectic space S =
{(phi in R mod 2pi, p > 0)} in terms of irreducible unitary representations of
the group SO(1,2) the present paper applies those results to that controversial
problem of quantizing moduli and phases of complex numbers: The Poisson
brackets of the classical observables p cos\phi, -p sin\phi and p > 0 form the
Lie algebra of the group SO(1,2). The corresponding self-adjoint generators
K_1, K_2 and K_3 of that group may be obtained from its irreducible unitary
representations. For the positive discrete series the modulus operator K_3 has
the spectrum {k+n, n = 0, 1,2,...; k > 0}. Self-adjoint operators for cos phi
and sin phi can be defined as ((1/K_3)K_1 + K_1/K_3)/2 and -((1/K_3)K_2 +
K_2/K_3)/2 which have the theoretically desired properties for k > or = 0.5.
The approach advocated here solves, e.g. the modulus-phase quantization problem
for the harmonic oscillator and appears to provide a full quantum theoretical
basis for the NFM-formalism.

Entanglement degradation due to a common type of environmental influence is
then computed by solving a master equation. However, we also demonstrate that
entanglement production is unaffected if the system-environment coupling is of
the type that induces ``motional narrowing''. As our second but related topic,
we construct a different master equation that seamlessly merges error
protection/detection dynamics for quantum information with the environmental
couplings responsible for producing the errors in the first place. Adiabatic
avoided crossing schemes are used in both topics.

the real computation model of Smale. The latter model was established as a
generalization of Turing computation. All this is not surprising since it is
well known that the physics of quantum field theory (which includes Einstein's
special relativity) contains quantum mechanics which in turn contains classical
mechanics. The unity of these computing models, which seem to have grown
largely independently, could shed new light into questions of computational
complexity, into the central P (Polynomial time) versus NP (Non-deterministic
