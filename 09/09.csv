cataclysmic variable V348 Puppis. The system displays the same spectroscopic
behaviour as SW Sex stars, so we classify V348 Pup as a new member of the
class. V348 Pup is the second SW Sex system (the first is V795 Herculis) which
lies in the period gap. The spectra exhibit enhanced HeII 4686 emission,
reminiscent of magnetic cataclysmic variables. The study of this emission line
gives a primary velocity semi-amplitude of K1 ~= 100 km/s. We have also derived
the system parameters, obtaining: M1 ~= 0.65 Msun, M2 ~= 0.20 Msun (q ~= 0.31),
i ~= 80 deg and K2 ~= 323 km/s. The spectroscopic behaviour of V348 Pup is very
similar to that of V795 Her, with the exception that V348 Pup shows deep
eclipses. We have computed the ``0.5-absorption'' spectrum of both systems,
obtaining spectra which resemble the absorption spectrum of a B0 V star. We
propose that absorption in SW Sex systems can be produced by a vertically
extended atmosphere which forms where the gas stream re-impacts the system,
either at the accretion disc or at the white dwarf's magnetosphere (assuming a
magnetic scenario).

provide an unambiguous signature of the peculiar ac Josephson effect at high

photon-assisted MARs.

not follow Poisson statistics. In particular, $P(s)$ shows a sharp peak at
$s=1$ while $\Delta_3(L)$ for small values of $L$ follows the Poissonian
predictions and asymptotically it shows large fluctuations around its mean
value. Finally, we analyze the information entropy, which shows a dissolution
of quantum numbers by breaking the axial symmetry of the rigid rotator.

mapping to the associated local mininum or inherent structure (IS) are
performed on unit-density Lennard-Jones (LJ). New dynamical quantities
introduced include r2_{is}(t), the mean-square displacement (MSD) within a
basin of attraction of an IS, R2(t), the MSD of the IS itself, and g_{loc}(t)
the mean waiting time in a cooperative region. At intermediate T, r2_{is}(t)
posesses an interval of linear t-dependence allowing calculation of an
intrabasin diffusion constant D_{is}. Near T_{c} diffusion is intrabasin
dominated with D = D_{is}. Below T_{c} the local waiting time tau_{loc} exceeds
the time, tau_{pl}, needed for the system to explore the basin, indicating the
action of barriers. The distinction between motion among the IS below T_{c} and
saddle, or border dynamics above T_{c} is discussed.

contributions and its renormalization due to Kondo correlations, away and at
the degeneracy point K=0. We show that these Kondo correlations induce
pronounced peaks in the conductance as function of magnetic field $B$,
inter-dot coupling $t_0$, and temperature. Moreover, the long-range part of the
Coulomb interaction becomes visibile due to Kondo correlations resulting in an
additional peak in the conductance vs $t_0$ with a strong $B$-field dependence.
These conductance peaks thus provide direct experimental access to $K$, and
thus to a crucial control parameter for spin-based qubits and entanglement.

short range correlations in the initial condition. A Ginzburg-Landau equation
with a global conservation law is employed as the phase field model. The
conditions are found under which the sharp-interface limit of this equation is
reducible to the area-preserving motion by curvature. Numerical simulations
show that, for both critical and off-critical quench, the equal time pair
correlation function exhibits dynamic scaling, and the characteristic
coarsening length obeys a power law in time with a 1/2 exponent. For the
critical quench, our results are in excellent agreement with earlier results.
For off-critical quench (Ostwald ripening) we investigate the dynamics of the
size distribution function of the minority phase domains. The simulations show
that, at large times, this distribution function has a self-similar form with
growth exponent 1/2. The scaled distribution, however, strongly differs from
the classical Wagner distribution. We attribute this difference to coalescence
of domains. A new theory of Ostwald ripening is developed that takes into
account binary coalescence events. The theoretical scaled distribution function
agrees very well with that obtained in the simulations.

approach via mirror symmetry. In the noncompact example where the Calabi-Yau is
