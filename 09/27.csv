several scenarios are discussed. Post-AGB evolution can be ruled out. PG
0229+064 and PG 1400+389 could be horizontal branch (HB) stars, while HD 76431
and SB 939 have already evolved away from the extreme HB (EHB). The low helium
abundance of HD 76431 is consistent with post-EHB evolution. The enrichment in
helium, carbon and nitrogen of the remaining stars can be explained either by
deep mixing of nuclearly processed material to the surface or by diffusion
processes modified by magnetic fields and/or stellar winds. A kinematic study
of their galactic orbits indicates that the stars belong to an old disk
population.

suggesting a possible close-in planetary companion. Subsequently, we initiated
a series of high-precision photometric observations to search for possible
planetary transits and an additional series of CaII H and K observations to
measure the level of surface magnetic activity and to look for possible
rotational modulation. Surprisingly, we found the star to be photometrically
variable and magnetically active. A detailed study of the phase stability of
the radial-velocity signal revealed that the radial-velocity variability
remains coherent only for durations of about 30days. Analysis of the time
variation of the spectroscopic line profiles using line bisectors revealed a
correlation between radial velocity and line-bisector orientation. All of these
observations, along with a one-quarter cycle phase shift between the
photometric and the radial-velocity variationss, are well explained by the
presence of dark photospheric spots on HD166435. We conclude that the
radial-velocity variations are not due to gravitational interaction with an
orbiting planet but, instead, originate from line-profile changes stemming from
star spots on the surface of the star. The quasi-coherence of the
radial-velocity signal over more than two years, which allowed a fair fit with
a binary model, makes the stability of this star unusual among other active
stars. It suggests a stable magnetic field orientation where spots are always
generated at about the same location on the surface of the star.

spectra are indicative of either synchrotron self-absorbed emission from jets,
convection-dominated accretion flows (CDAFs) with L >= 10^{-5} L_Edd, or ADAFs
with strong (p >= 0.6) outflows. The jet interpretation is favored by three
factors: a) the detection of pc-scale radio extensions, morphologically
reminiscent of jets, in the five nuclei with the highest peak radio
flux-density; b) the domination of parsec-scale jet radio emission over
unresolved `core' emission in the three best-studied nuclei; and c) the lack of
any clear correlation between radio spectral shape and black hole mass as would

and emphasize that the arguments often used to reject the accretion scenario
for massive stars are misleading. It is usually not accounted for the fact that
the turbulent pressure associated to large turbulent velocities in clouds
necessarily imply relatively high accretion rates for massive stars. We show
the basic difference between the formation of low and high mass stars based on
the values of the free fall time and of the Kelvin-Helmoltz timescale, and
define the concept of birthline for massive stars.
  Due to D-burning, the radius and location of the birthline in the HR diagram,
as well as the lifetimes are very sensitive to the accretion rate \dot M_accr.
If a form \dot M_accr=A (M/M_sun)^phi is adopted, the observations in the HR
diagram and the lifetimes support a value of A=10^{-5} M_sun/yr and a value of
phi>1. Remarkably, such a law is consistent with the relation found by
Churchwell (1998) and Henning et al. (2000) between the outflow rates and the
luminosities of ultra--compact HII regions, if we assume that a fraction 0.15
to 0.3 of the global inflow is accreted. The above relation implies high \dot
M_accr=10^{-3} M_sun/yr for the most massive stars. The physical possibility of
such high \dot M_accr is supported by current numerical models.
  Finally, we give simple analytical arguments in favour of the growth of \dot
M_accr with the already accreted mass. We also suggest that due to Bondi-Hoyle
accretion, the formation of binary stars is largely favoured among massive
stars in the accretion scenario.

TexOx Cluster survey. In an observation of this field with the Ryle Telescope
(RT) at 15 GHz, we measure a decrement in the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
of $-675 \pm 95 \mu$Jy on the RT's $\approx$ 0.65 k$\lambda$ baseline. Using
optical and infrared imaging with the McDonald 2.7-m Smith Reflector, Calar

radiosources and measure magnitudes of $R \approx 24$, $J \approx 20$, $K

  The CMB decrement is consistent with the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect of a
massive cluster of galaxies, which if modelled as a spherical King profile of
core radius $\theta_C = 20^{\prime\prime}$ has a central temperature decrement
of $900 \mu$K. The magnitudes and colours of the galaxies are consistent with
those of old ellipticals at $z \sim 1$. We therefore conclude that TOC
J0233.3+3021 is a massive, high redshift cluster. These observations add to the
growing evidence for a significant population of massive clusters at high
redshift, and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining searches for AGN
`signposts' to clusters with the redshift-independence of the SZ effect.

have detected the lensing signal induced by intervening large scale structure

study the lensing signal from intermediate redshift galaxies with 19.5<R_C<21

yields a mass weighted velocity dispersion of 111+-5 km/s. In addition we have
constrained for the first time the extent of dark matter halos, and find a
robust upper limit for the truncation parameter s<470 h^{-1} kpc (99.7%

parameter b and the galaxy-mass cross-correlation coefficient r. The results
are consistent with a scale-independent value of b/r, for which we find

scientific goal of In.XS is to resolve a large fraction of this HXB into
individual sources.
  As no distortion by Compton up-scattering is seen in the spectrum of the
microwave background, the hard X-ray background is believed to be mainly due to
point sources. Type I Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have softer X-ray spectra
than the hard X-ray background, so other sources must be considered, like faint
Type II or absorbed AGN. These could be distinguished through hard X-ray
spectroscopic or hardness ratio observations.
  Here we present In.XS - a mission concept designed to conduct the first
imaging all-sky hard X-ray (2-80 keV) survey. The angular resolution of nearly
1 arcmin and good sensitivity at high energies is provided by the latest
multilayer focussing mirrors, with semiconductor-based (GaAs) arrays of
detectors. We also describe the mission operations, and how the all-sky survey
will be complemented by follow-up pointed observations of selected fields. The
good angular resolution will allow correlations and identification with objects
seen at other wavelengths. In addition, since a large fraction of the Type II
AGN luminosity is emitted in the hard X-ray band, this survey will provide a
large unbiased sample of the AGN population. This may provide constraints on
AGN evolution through the possible observation of a turnover in deep field
source statistics.

FeII arising from the decay of upper levels pumped by Ly-alpha fluorescence are
resolved and identified in active galactic nuclei. Excitation mechanisms
leading to the emission of the 1 micron FeII features are discussed. A
combination of Ly-alpha fluorescence and collisional excitation are found to be
the main contributors. The flux ratio between near-IR FeII lines varies from
object to object, in contrast to what is observed in the optical region. A good
correlation between the 1 micron and optical FeII emission is found. This
suggests that the upper z4Fo and z4Do levels from which the bulk of the optical
lines descend are mainly populated by the transitions leading to the 1 micron
lines. The width and profile shape of FeII 11127, CaII 8642 and OI 8446 are

all DHETs with GaSb thickness $>$ 60 \AA below which a dramatic change in the
shape of the I-V and a marked hysteresis is observed. The temperature
dependence of the I-V is found to be very strong below this critical GaSb
thickness. The I-V characteristics of selected DHETs are also presented under
hydrostatic pressures up to 11 kbar. Finally, a mid infra-red
electroluminescence is observed at 1 bar with a threshold at the NDR valley
bias. The band profile calculations presented in the analysis are markedly
different to those given in the literature, and arise due to the positive
charge that it is argued will build up in the GaSb layer under bias. We
conclude that the dominant conduction mechanism in DHETs is most likely to
arise out of an inelastic electron-heavy-hole interaction similar to that
observed in single heterojunctions (SHETs) with 'GaAs like' interface bonding,

temperature and a linear velocity profile $U_x(y)=a y$, where $a$ is the
constant shear rate. In the case of a rarefied gas, all the relevant physical
information is represented by the one-particle velocity distribution function
$f({\bf r},{\bf v})=f({\bf V})$, with ${\bf V}\equiv {\bf v}-{\bf U}({\bf r})$,
which satisfies the standard nonlinear integro-differential Boltzmann equation.
We have studied this state for a two-dimensional gas of Maxwell molecules with
grazing collisions in which the nonlinear Boltzmann collision operator reduces
to a Fokker-Planck operator. We have found analytically that for shear rates
larger than a certain threshold value the velocity distribution function
exhibits an algebraic high-velocity tail of the form $f({\bf V};a)\sim |{\bf
V}|^{-4-\sigma(a)}\Phi(\phi; a)$, where $\phi\equiv \tan V_y/V_x$ and the
angular distribution function $\Phi(\phi; a)$ is the solution of a modified
Mathieu equation. The enforcement of the periodicity condition $\Phi(\phi;
a)=\Phi(\phi+\pi; a)$ allows one to obtain the exponent $\sigma(a)$ as a
function of the shear rate. As a consequence of this power-law decay, all the
velocity moments of a degree equal to or larger than $2+\sigma(a)$ are
divergent. In the high-velocity domain the velocity distribution is highly
anisotropic, with the angular distribution sharply concentrated around a
preferred orientation angle which rotates counterclock-wise as the shear rate
increases.

Continued oxidation results in the formation and stacking of more of these
trilayers, which unfold into the RuO_2(110) rutile structure once a critical

metastable configurations. These are found to be rather close in energy,
indicating a likely lively dynamics between them at elevated temperatures,

explain the power law distributions in the individual wealth (w_i (t)) (Pareto
law) and financial markets returns (fluctuations) (r) as a result of the
auto-catalytic (multiplicative random) character of the individual capital
dynamics.
  As long as the multiplicative random factor (lambda) is extracted from the
same probability distribution for all the individuals, the exponent of the
power laws turns out to be independent on the time variations of the average
(<lambda >). This explains also the stability over the past century of
experimentally measured Pareto exponent.
  In contrast to the scaling properties of the single time (""unconditional"")
probability distributions, the (auto-)correlations between observables measured
at different times are not correctly reproduced by the original GLV, if the
variance (sigma^2) of $\lambda$ is time independent. In the GLV formalism the
volatility (r^2) auto-correlations decay exponentially while the measurements
in real markets indicate a power law with a very small exponent.
  We show in the present paper that by making the variance of the individual
wealth changes (sigma^2) a function of the market volatility <r^2>, one
correctly reproduces the market volatility long range correlations. Moreover,
we show that this non-trivial feedback loop between the market price volatility
and the variance of the investors wealth leads to non-trivial patterns in the
overall market trends. If the feedback is too strong, it may even endanger the
market stability.

so that the bands are little affected by the way in which we confine the
electrons on the surface (thin-slab limit or zero thickness from the outset).
Another curiosity is that different minimal surfaces connected by the Bonnet
transformation (such as Schwarz's P- and D-surfaces) possess one-to-one
correspondence in their band energies at Brillouin zone boundaries.

magnetic properties of the spin-triplet and spin-singlet Cooper pairs. The
difference appears when both of the paired electrons couple to a local spin
directly. For the $p_x + i p_y$-wave, the ground state is always a spin doublet
for a $S_{\rm imp} = 1/2$ local spin, and it is always a spin singlet for

Cooper pair. For the $d_{x^2 - y^2} + i d_{xy}$-wave, the interchange of ground

fuzzy band expression is derived in detail from first principles. We go beyond
the sudden approximation to account for both extrinsic losses and interference
effects. In an extension of earlier work we discuss both core and valence
satellites including both intrinsic and extrinsic amplitudes, and high energy
excitations as well as low energy electron-hole pairs. We show how the
extrinsic losses in photoemission can be connected with the electron energy
loss function. This is achieved by three approximations, to connect the
dynamically screened potential in the bulk solid to the loss function, to
account for the surface, and lastly to extrapolate zero momentum loss data to
include dispersion. The extrinsic losses are found to be weak for small loss
energies. For larger loss energies the extrinsic losses can be strong and have
strong interference with the intrinsic losses depending on the nature of the
solid. The transition from the adiabatic to the sudden regime is discussed for
atoms and localized systems and compared with the situation for solids. We
argue that in solids for photoelectron energies above some 10 eV the external
losses are mainly connected with spacially extended excitations. We discuss
strongly correlated quasi-two-dimensional solids with Bi2212 as example, and
find an asymmetric broadening of the main peak from shake up of acoustic
three-dimensional plasmons. In the superconducting state the loss function is
assumed to have a gap, which then leads to a peak-dip-hump structure in the
photoemission spectrum. This structure is compared with a corresponding

fronts in the mean-field limit is modelled with a stochastic model with a
finite number $N$ of particles per correlation volume, the convergence to the
speed $v^*$ for $N \to \infty$ is extremely slow -- going only as $\ln^{-2}N$.
In this paper, we study the front propagation in a simple stochastic lattice
model. A detailed analysis of the microscopic picture of the front dynamics
shows that for the description of the far tip of the front, one has to abandon
the idea of a uniformly translating front solution. The lattice and finite
particle effects lead to a ``stop-and-go'' type dynamics at the far tip of the
front, while the average front behind it ``crosses over'' to a uniformly
translating solution. In this formulation, the effect of stochasticity on the
asymptotic front speed is coded in the probability distribution of the times
required for the advancement of the ``foremost bin''. We derive expressions of
these probability distributions by matching the solution of the far tip with
the uniformly translating solution behind. This matching includes various
correlation effects in a mean-field type approximation. Our results for the
probability distributions compare well to the results of stochastic numerical
simulations. This approach also allows us to deal with much smaller values of
$N$ than it is required to have the $\ln^{-2}N$ asymptotics to be valid.

Dhurandhar [1996] using a hierarchy of templates over the mass parameters,
which speeded up the procedure by about 25 to 30 times. We show that a further
reduction in computational cost is possible if we extend the hierarchy paradigm
to an extra parameter, namely, the time of arrival of the signal. In the first
stage, the chirp waveform is cut-off at a relatively low frequency allowing the
data to be coarsely sampled leading to cost saving in performing the FFTs. This
is possible because most of the signal power is at low frequencies, and
therefore the advantage due to hierarchy over masses is not compromised.
Results are obtained for spin-less templates up to the second post-Newtonian
(2PN) order for a single detector with LIGO I noise power spectral density. We
estimate that the gain in computational cost over a flat search is about 100.

do not require any form factor information and therefore may be especially
suitable for extracting information on the angles $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ of the
unitarity triangle. The strong phase coming from final-state rescattering due
to hard gluon exchange between the final states can induce large rate
asymmetries for tree-dominated color-suppressed modes

hadronic two-body B-decays, we have to quantify non-perturbative QCD effects.
Approaches based on the factorization of mass singularities into hadronic
distribution amplitudes and form factors provide a rigorous theoretical
framework for the evaluation of these effects in the heavy quark limit. But it
is not possible to calculate power corrections in a model-independent way,
because of non-factorizing long-distance contributions. It has been argued that
Sudakov effects suppress these contributions and render the corresponding
corrections perturbatively calculable. In this paper we examine this claim for
the related example of semileptonic B -> pi decays and conclude that it is not
justified. The uncertainties in our knowledge of the mesons' distribution
amplitudes imply that the calculations of the form factors are not sufficiently
precise to be useful phenomenologically. Moreover, a significant contribution
comes from the non-perturbative region of large impact parameters, and is
therefore uncalculable. We also raise a number of theoretical issues in the
derivation of the underlying formalism. For B-decays it is thus not possible to
invoke Sudakov effects to calculate amplitudes for decays which have
long-distance divergences (end-point singularities) in the standard
hard-scattering approach.

D 17, 385-393 (2001)","10.1007/s100530170012",,"quant-ph",,"  For a bi-partite quantum system defined in a finite dimensional Hilbert space
we investigate in what sense entanglement change and interactions imply each
other. For this purpose we introduce an entanglement operator, which is then
shown to represent a non-conserved property for any bi-partite system and any
type of interaction. This general relation does not exclude the existence of
special initial product states, for which the entanglement remains small over
some period of time, despite interactions. For this case we derive an
approximation to the full Schroedinger equation, which allows the treatment of
the composite systems in terms of product states. The induced error is
estimated. In this factorization-approximation one subsystem appears as an
effective potential for the other. A pertinent example is the Jaynes-Cummings
model, which then reduces to the semi-classical rotating wave approximation.

orderings on ensembles of $N$ pure quantum states. This is demonstrated using
ensembles of equally-probable, linearly independent, symmetrical pure states,
with the maximum probabilities of correct hypothesis testing and unambiguous
state discrimination being the distinguishability measures. This finding
implies that there is no absolute scale for comparing the distinguishability of
any two ensembles of $N$ quantum states, and that distinguishability comparison
is necessarily relative to a particular discrimination strategy.

presence of a static electric field. As in Wanniers analysis of the analogous
situation without external field the dynamics near threshold is dominated by a
saddle. With a field the saddle lies in a subspace of symmetrically escaping
electrons. Near threshold the classical cross section scales with excess energy
E like sigma=E^alpha, where the exponent alpha can be determined from the
stability of the saddle and does not depend on the field strength. For example,
if the remaining ion has charge Z=2, the exponent is 1.292, significantly
different from the 1.056 without the field.
