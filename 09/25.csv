chromosphere-corona transition region to cases with particle and mass flows.
The cases considered here are quasi-steady, and satisfy the momentum and energy
balance equations in the transition region. We include in all equations the
flow velocity terms and neglect the partial derivatives with respect to time.
We present a complete and physically consistent formulation and method for
solving the non-LTE and energy balance equations in these situations, including
both particle diffusion and flows of H and He. Our results show quantitatively
how mass flows affect the ionization and radiative losses of H and He, thereby
affecting the structure and extent of the transition region. Also, our
computations show that the H and He line profiles are greatly affected by
flows. We find that line shifts are much less important than the changes in
line intensity and central reversal due to the effects of flows. In this paper
we use fixed conditions at the base of the transition region and in the
chromosphere because our intent is to show the physical effects of flows and
not to match any particular observations. However, we note that the profiles we
compute can explain the range of observed high spectral and spatial resolution
Lyman alpha profiles from the quiet Sun. We suggest that dedicated modeling of
specific sequences of observations based on physically consistent methods like
those presented here will substantially improve our understanding of the energy
balance in the chromosphere and corona.

edge-like discontinuities in their gas density. The gas temperature is higher
in front of the edge where the density is low, corresponding to approximately
continuous pressure across the edge. This new phenomenon was called ``cold
fronts'', to contrast it to shock fronts that should look similar in X-ray
images but where the temperature should jump in the opposite direction. The
first cold fronts were discovered in merging clusters, where they appear to
delineate the boundaries of dense cool subcluster remnants moving through and
being stripped by the surrounding shock-heated gas. Later, Chandra revealed
cold fronts in the central regions of several apparently relaxed clusters. To
explain the gas bulk motion in these clusters, we propose either a peculiar
cluster formation history that resulted in an oscillating core, or gas sloshing
(without the involvement of the underlying dark matter peak) caused by past
subcluster infall or central AGN activity. We review these observations and
discuss their implications for the X-ray cluster mass estimates.

suggests that K-band light from bright galaxies in clusters traces the total

the mass-to-light ratio inside $r_{200}$ may be as much as a factor of 2.5

We find that the number of companions per galaxy (for -21 < M_B^{k,e} < -18) is
Nc = 0.0321 +/- 0.0077 at z=0.3. The luminosity in companions, per galaxy, is
Lc = 0.0294 +/- 0.0084 x 10^10 h^2 L_sun. We assume that Nc is proportional to
the galaxy merger rate, while Lc is directly related to the mass accretion
rate. After increasing the maximum pair separation to 50 h^{-1} kpc, and
comparing with the low redshift SSRS2 pairs sample, we infer evolution in the
galaxy merger and accretion rates of (1+z)^{2.3 +/- 0.7} and (1+z)^{2.3 +/-

Bartunov, Makarova & Tsvetkov (1992). SNe discovered in pairs do not privilege
a particular direction with respect to the companion galaxy. Also the azimuthal
distributions inside the hosts members of galaxy groups are consistent with
being isotropics. The fact that SNe are more frequent in the brighter
components of the pairs and groups is expected from the dependence of the SN
rates on the galaxy luminosity. There is an indication that the SN rate is
higher in galaxy pairs compared with that in groups. This can be related to the
enhanced star formation rate in strongly interacting systems. It is concluded
that, with the possible exception of strongly interacting system, the parent

only asymptotically correct in the limit of a large number of stars, where
sampling errors become asymptotically small. When dealing with stellar
clusters, starbursts, dwarf galaxies or stellar populations within pixels,
sampling errors introduce a large dispersion in the predicted integrated
properties of these populations. We present here an approximate but generic
statistical formalism which allows a very good estimation of the uncertainties
and confidence levels in any integrated property, bypassing extensive Monte
Carlo simulations, and including the effects of partial correlations between
different observables. Tests of the formalism are presented and compared with
proper estimates. We derive the minimum mass of stellar populations which is
required to reach a given confidence limit for a given integrated property. As
an example of this general formalism, which can be included in any synthesis
code, we apply it to the case of young (t < 20 Myr) starburst populations. We
show that, in general, the UV continuum is more reliable than other continuum
bands for the comparison of models with observed data. We also show that
clusters where more than 10^5 Mo have been transformed into stars have a
relative dispersion of about 10% in Q(He+) for ages smaller than 3 Myr. During
the WR phase the dispersion increases to about 25% for such massive clusters.
We further find that the most reliable observable for the determination of the
WR population is the ratio of the luminosity of the WR bump over the Hbeta
luminosity. A fraction of the observed scatter in the integrated properties of
clusters and starbursts can be accounted for by sampling fluctuations.

galaxies might be tracked down by occasional tidal disruptions of stars on
nearly radial orbits. A tidal disruption event would reveal itself by a
luminous flare of electromagnetic radiation. Theorists argued that the
convincing detection of such a tidal disruption event would be the observation
of an event which fulfills the following three criteria: (1) the event should
be of finite duration (a `flare'), (2) it should be very luminous (up to
L_{max} ~ 10^{45} erg/s in maximum), and (3) it should reside in a galaxy that
is otherwise perfectly {\em non-active} (to be sure to exclude an upward
fluctuation in gaseous accretion rate of an {\em active} galaxy). During the
last few years, several X-ray flare events were detected which match exactly
the above criteria. We therefore consider these events to be excellent
candidates for the occurrences of the theoretically predicted tidal disruption
flares.
  In this contribution, we review the previous observations of giant X-ray
flares from normal galaxies, present new results on these objects, critically
discuss alternatives to the favored outburst scenario, and report results from
our ongoing search for further tidal disruption flares based on the ROSAT
all-sky survey database.

Comparison of PL relations in metal poor galaxy IC1613 ([Fe/H]~-1.0 dex) with
relations in metal richer Magellanic Clouds allows us to study dependence of
Cepheid PL relations on metallicity in the wide range of metallicities covered
by these three galaxies. The slopes of PL relations in IC1613 are identical as
in the Magellanic Clouds. The comparison of brightness of Cepheids with the
magnitudes of the tip of the red giant branch stars and RR Lyr stars in all
three objects provides information on the stability of zero points of PL
relations in the I and V-band, respectively. We find that the zero points of PL
relations are constant to better than $\pm0.03$ mag over the entire range of
covered metallicities. Thus, the most important conclusion of the paper is that
the Cepheid PL relations do not depend on metallicity. Additionally we
determine the mean distance to IC1613, based on the common distance scale
resulting from four major stellar distance indicators: Cepheids, RR Lyr, TRGB

  Clouds: A Comparison between Theory and Observations","11 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Astrophysical Journal",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The one-point statistics of column density distributions of turbulent
molecular cloud models are investigated and compared with observations. In
agreement with the observations, the number N of pixels with surface density S
is distributed exponentially N(S)=exp(-S/S0) in models of driven compressible
supersonic turbulence. However, in contrast to the observations, the
exponential slope defined by S0 is not universal but instead depends strongly
on the adopted rms Mach number and on the smoothing of the data cube. We
demonstrate that this problem can be solved if one restricts the analysis of
the surface density distribution to subregions with sizes equal to the
correlation length of the flow which turns out to be given by the driving
scale. In this case, the column density distributions are universal with a
slope that is in excellent agreement with the observations and independent of
the Mach number or smoothing. The observed molecular clouds therefore are
coherent structures with sizes of order their correlation lengths. Turbulence
inside these clouds must be driven on the largest scales, if at all. Numerical
models of turbulent molecular clouds have to be restricted to cubes with sizes
similar to the correlation lengthscale in order to be compared with
observations. Our results imply that turbulence is generated on scales that are
much larger that the Jeans length. In this case, gravitational collapse cannot
be suppressed and star formation should start in molecular clouds within a
dynamical timescale after their formation.

and an outer ring, evidence of an ongoing merger. The system contains
\~1.8x10^{10}Msolar of highly disturbed molecular gas which lies in an
asymmetric bar-like structure with the peak in observed CO column densities
significantly offset from the compact double nucleus. In contrast to this, the
ISO observations show strong dust emission centered on the AGN, located in one
of the two nuclei. Fainter CO, MIR, and radio continuum emission provide a
glimpse of the complexities of star formation in the outer ring. An analysis of
the kinematics of the main CO emission reveal evidence for two dynamically
distinct molecular components within NGC985. The first is a set of isolated
super-giant molecular clouds (SGMCs) which are concentrated within 9-10kpc of
the active nucleus. Although randomly distributed about the center, the clouds
may form part of a clumpy highly-disturbed disk which may be either just
forming around double-nucleus (the making of a ULIRG), or alternatively may be
in the process of being disrupted-perhaps as a result of a powerful nuclear
outflow (the breaking of a ULIRG). A second major concentration of CO lies
offset from the double-nucleus in a dynamically coherent ridge of emission in
which powerful star formation is occurring. We tentatively associate CO
emission with two out of six UV absorption-lines seen in the blue wing of the
very broad Lyman alpha emission. Such an association would imply a complex
inter-relationship between the nuclear CO cloud population in colliding
systems, and AGN-driven winds.

correlated electron systems and discuss their application to the cuprate high
temperature superconductors. The coupled-ladder antiferromagnet displays a
transition between the Neel state and a spin gap paramagnet with a sharp S=1
exciton: we develop a careful argument which eventually establishes that this
transition is described by the familiar O(3) \phi^4 field theory in 2+1
dimensions. Crucial to this argument is the role played by the quantum Berry
phases. We illustrate this role in a one-dimensional example where our results
can tested against those known from bosonization. On bipartite lattices in two
dimensions, we study the influence of Berry phases on the quantum transition
involving the loss of Neel order, and show that they induce bond-centered
charge order (e.g. spin Peierls order) in the paramagnetic phase. We extend
this theory of magnetic transitions in insulators to that between an ordinary
d-wave superconductor and one with co-existing spin-density-wave order.
Finally, we discuss quantum transitions between superconductors involving
changes in the Cooper pair wavefunction, as in a transition between d_{x^2-y^2}
and d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy} superconductors. A mean-field theory for this
transition is provided by the usual BCS theory; however, BCS theory fails near
the critical point, and we present the required field-theoretic extension. Our
discussion includes a perspective on the phase diagram of the cuprate
superconductors, in the context of recent experiments and the transitions

Cu3Au lattice constant (3.75 Angstrom) and the equilibrium lattice constant for
fcc ferromagnetic Fe (3.65 Angstrom). Growth proceeds almost layer by layer at
room temperature, with a small amount of Au segregation in the early stage of
deposition. Islands of 1-2 nm lateral size and double layer height are formed
when 1 monolayer of Fe is deposited on Cu3Au(001) at low temperature. We used
the PhotoElectron Diffraction technique to investigate the atomic structure and
chemical composition of these nanoislands just after the deposition at 140 K

low temperature, without any surface segregation. After annealing, the Fe atoms
are re-aggregated to form mainly tri-layer islands. Surface segregation is
shown to be inhibited also after the annealing process. The implications for

show that the ratio $\Gamma$ of linear responses of networks to DC and AC
driving can be used as a surrogate for their strength. The possibility of using

accounts for: an arbitrary number and arrangement of dislocation lines over a
slip plane; the long-range elastic interactions between dislocation lines; the
core structure of the dislocations resulting from a piecewise quadratic Peierls
potential; the interaction between the dislocations and an applied resolved
shear stress field; and the irreversible interactions with short-range
obstacles and lattice friction, resulting in hardening, path dependency and
hysteresis. A chief advantage of the present theory is that it is analytically
tractable, in the sense that the complexity of the calculations may be reduced,
with the aid of closed form analytical solutions, to the determination of the
value of the phase field at point-obstacle sites. In particular, no numerical
grid is required in calculations. The phase-field representation enables
complex geometrical and topological transitions in the dislocation ensemble,
including dislocation loop nucleation, bow-out, pinching, and the formation of
Orowan loops. The theory also permits the consideration of obstacles of varying
strengths and dislocation line-energy anisotropy. The theory predicts a range
of behaviors which are in qualitative agreement with observation, including:
hardening and dislocation multiplication in single slip under monotonic
loading; the Bauschinger effect under reverse loading; the fading memory
effect, whereby reverse yielding gradually eliminates the influence of previous
loading; the evolution of the dislocation density under cycling loading,
leading to characteristic `butterfly' curves; and others.

non-profit company which, pursuant to contracts with the US government, acts as
the de facto regulator for DNS policy. ICANN decides what TLDs will be made
available to users, and which registrars will be permitted to offer those TLDs
for sale. In this article we focus on a hitherto-neglected implication of
ICANN's assertion that it is a private rather than a public actor: its
potential liability under the U.S. antitrust laws, and the liability of those
who transact with it. ICANN argues that it is not as closely tied to the
government as NSI and IANA were in the days before ICANN was created. If this
is correct, it seems likely that ICANN will not benefit from the antitrust
immunity those actors enjoyed. Some of ICANN's regulatory actions may restrain
competition, e.g. its requirement that applicants for new gTLDs demonstrate
that their proposals would not enable competitive (alternate) roots and ICANN's
preventing certain types of non-price competition among registrars (requiring
the UDRP). ICANN's rule adoption process might be characterized as
anticompetitive collusion by existing registrars, who are likely not be subject
to the Noerr-Pennington lobbying exemption. Whether ICANN has in fact violated
the antitrust laws depends on whether it is an antitrust state actor, whether
the DNS is an essential facility, and on whether it can shelter under
precedents that protect standard-setting bodies. If (as seems likely) a private
ICANN and those who petition it are subject to antitrust law, everyone involved
in the process needs to review their conduct with an eye towards legal

technologically complex and entail high costs for subscribers. The political
economy of the development process has biased the subscriber base toward the
resource rich and away from the resource poor, and toward tried-and-tested uses
like Internet and intra-organizational connectivity and away from

broader phenomenon. Specifically, I suggest that nonproprietary peer-production
of information and cultural materials will likely be a ubiquitous phenomenon in
a pervasively networked society. I describe a number of such enterprises, at
various stages of the information production value chain. These enterprises
suggest that incentives to engage in nonproprietary peer production are trivial
as long as enough contributors can be organized to contribute. This implies
that the limit on the reach of peer production efforts is the modularity,
granularity, and cost of integration of a good produced, not its total cost. I
also suggest reasons to think that peer-production can have systematic
advantages over both property-based markets and corporate managerial
hierarchies as a method of organizing information and cultural production in a
networked environment, because it is a better mechanism for clearing
information about human capital available to work on existing information
inputs to produce new outputs, and because it permits largers sets of agents to
use larger sets of resources where there are increasing returns to the scale of
both the set of agents and the set of resources available for work on projects.
As capital costs and communications costs decrease in importance as factors of
information production, the relative advantage of peer production in clearing
human capital becomes more salient.

by state and nonstate actors. The use of force over the Internet warrants
analysis given recent terrorist attacks. At the same time that information
technology empowers states and their commercial enterprises, information
technology makes infrastructures supported by computer systems increasingly
accessible, interdependent, and more vulnerable to malicious attack. The
Computer Security Institute and the FBI jointly estimate that financial losses
attributed to malicious attack amounted to $378 million in 2000. International
Law clearly permits a state to respond in self-defense when attacked by another
state through the Internet, however, such attacks may not always rise to the
scope, duration, and intensity threshold of an armed attack that may justify a
use of force in self-defense.
  This paper presents a policy framework to analyze the rules of engagement for
Internet attacks. We describe the state of Internet security, incentives for
asymmetric warfare, and the development of international law for conflict
management and armed conflict. We focus on options for future rules of
engagement specific to Information Warfare.
  We conclude with four policy recommendations for Internet attack rules of
engagement: (1) the U.S. should pursue international definitions of ""force"" and
""armed attack"" in the Information Warfare context; (2) the U.S. should pursue
international cooperation for the joint investigation and prosecution of
Internet attacks; (3) the U.S. must balance offensive opportunities against
defensive vulnerabilities; and (4) the U.S. should prepare strategic plans now
rather than making policy decisions in real-time during an Internet attack.

first establish that without any pricing mechanism, congestion externalities
overwhelm other network effects in a wireless data network. We show that
peering technology will mitigate the congestion and allow users to take
advantage of more the positive network externalities. However, without pricing,
the peering equilibrium breaks down just like a bucket brigade made up of
free-riding agents. With pricing and perfect competition, a peering equilibrium
is possible and allows many more users on the network at the same time.
However, the congestion externality is still a problem, so peering organized
through a club may be the best solution.

potential to affect competition in local access. On one hand, the high cost of
deploying fiber to the residence suggests limitations on facilities-based
competition among FTTH networks. On the other hand, FTTH opens up new
possibilities for service-level competition, defined as the sharing of a single
network infrastructure by multiple higher-layer service providers, whether of
the same or different services. Yet technology is hardly an exogenous factor
that independently shapes future local access competition; the regulatory
environment also plays a key role. By shaping expectations about future
competitive requirements, current regulations influence network operators'
deployment choices among competing FTTH technologies, as well as design choices
made by vendors and standards bodies for technologies still under
development.The current regulatory approach to FTTH is far from consistent.
Network operators likely to deploy FTTH include Incumbent Local Exchange
Carriers (ILECs), incumbent cable operators, competitive access providers
(including CLECs), independent telephone companies, and municipalities. This
paper reviews the rules related to service-level competition that apply to each
of these categories. In essence, the paper finds that if current regulatory
trends continue, asymmetries in the regulation of service-level competition
will be on steroids by the time FTTH starts being more commonly deployed.
Current regulatory requirements are either non-existent, or extremely detailed
and technology- and service- specific (e.g. UNEs). We argue that neither of
these approaches is likely to achieve the desired result for FTTH, given the
current state of flux in emerging FTTH technology.

little local facilities-based competition. In response there are calls in
Congress and even from the FCC for new legislation to ""free the Bells.""
However, the same ideology drove policy, not just five years ago, but also
almost twenty years back with the first modern push for ""freedom,"" namely
divestiture.
  How might we frame the question of policy for local access to engender a more
fruitful approach? The starting point for this analysis is the network--not
bits and bytes, but the human network. With the human network as starting
point, the unit of analysis is the community--specifically, the individual in a
tension with community. There are two core ideas.
  The first takes a behavioral approach to the economics--and the relative
share between beneficial chaos and order, in economic affairs, becomes
explicit.
  If the first main idea provides a conceptual base for open source, the second
core idea distinguishes open source from open design, ie at the information
'frontier' we push forward.
  The resulting policy frame for access is worked out in the detailed, concrete
steps of an extended thought experiment. A small town setting (Concord,
Massachusetts) grounds the discussion in the real world. The purpose overall is
to stimulate new thinking which may break out of the conundrum where periodic
rounds to legislate 'freedom' produce the opposite, recursively. The ultimate
aim is better fit between our analytically-driven expectations and economic
outcomes.

challenges and solutions for realspace sovereigns in cyberspace. First, we
analyze the 'in rem' provision of the US Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection
Act (ACPA), which purports to expand the scope of the ACPA to encompass
disputes with little direct connection with the United States. In reality,
there exist no cases of foreign cybersquatting as to which the 'in rem'
provision will be both applicable and constitutional. Instead the ACPA 'in rem'
provision is notable primarily for its aggressive assertion of jurisdiction,
leading us to consider the (often overlooked) role of realspace sovereigns in
the regulation of the domain names system. By mapping the logical control over
the domain names system-the distributed hierarchy that is the basis of the
system's design-onto realspace territory, the potential for sovereign
regulation of the system becomes apparent. We argue that the regulatory
significance of geography, and the essentially arbitrary nature of the present
territorial locations of the key components of the domain name system implies
the future segmentation of the domain name system, and the resulting dramatic
decrease in its value. Accordingly, we argue that realspace sovereigns (and
especially the United States) have strong interests in avoiding segmentation,
and thus must seek to coordinate the regulation of the system.

of Internet diffusion on civic engagement in geographic communities. It draws
on findings from survey data collected in four U.S. towns and cities in fall
2000 where community computer networking is established. The study shows that
early adopters of the Internet are more likely to engage in civic activities
and to have higher levels of community involvement than later adopters.
Further, early adopters are more likely to use the Internet to increase their
community involvement and political participation. Later adopters in all four
sites show less involvement in their local community and less interest in
political activity and information, online or offline. These findings reinforce
those of the Kohut (1999) study showing that later adopters are less civic
minded and more interested than early adopters in consumer and commercial
applications, such as shopping and entertainment. The evidence in these four
sites is consistent with earlier findings in Blacksburg, Virginia (Kavanaugh,
2000; Patterson and Kavanaugh, 2001; Kavanaugh and Patterson, 2001) and other
studies of early innovation adopters (Rogers, 1983; Kohut, 1999; Valente, 1995,
among others). The results reported in this paper lend weight to the argument
that increases in civic engagement and community involvement are due primarily
to the behavior of early adopters, making such increases a phase, not a trend.
As later adopters come on line, use of the Internet for community involvement
or civic engagement decreases. In the long term, we can expect that Internet
access may have only a modest effect on community involvement and civic
engagement in geographic communities.

sellers' listing behavior in the two leading Internet auctions sites, eBay and
Yahoo!Auctions. The descriptive data analysis of the seller's equilibrium
listing behavior indicates that a seller's higher expected auction revenue from
eBay is correlated with a lager number of potential bidders measured by website
usage per listing. Our estimation results, based on the logarithm
specifications of sellers' expected auction revenues and potential bidders'
website usage, show that in a median case, (i) 1 percent increase of the unique
visitors (page views) per listed item induces 0.022 (0.007) percent increase of
a seller's expected auction revenue; and (ii) 1 percent increase of sellers'
listings induces 1.99 (4.74) percent increase of the unique visitors (page
views). Since increased expected auction revenues will induce more listings, we
can infer positive feedback effects between the number of listings and website
usage. Consequently, Yahoo!Auctions, which has substantially less listings, has
greater incentives to increase listings via these feedback effects which are
reflected in its fee schedules.

  Imagine a military base. It is defended against possible attack. Do we expect
the base to reveal the location of booby traps and other defenses? No. But for
many computer applications,a software developer will need to reveal a great
deal about the code to get other system owners to trust the code and know how
to operate with it.
  This article examines these conflicting intuitions and develops a theory
about what should be open and hidden in computer security. Part I of the paper
shows how substantial openness is typical for major computer security topics,
such as firewalls, packaged software, and encryption. Part II shows what
factors will lead to openness or hiddenness in computer security.
  Part III presents an economic analysis of the issue of what should be open in
computer security. The owner who does not reveal the booby traps is like a
monopolist, while the open-source software supplier is in a competitive market.
This economic approach allows us to identify possible market failures in how
much openness occurs for computer security.
  Part IV examines the contrasting approaches of Sun Tzu and Clausewitz to the
role of hiddenness and deception in military strategy. The computer security,
economic, and military strategy approaches thus each show factors relevant to
what should be kept hidden in computer security. Part V then applies the theory
to a range of current legal and technical issues.

that a decentralized, peer-to-peer system of communications and information is
both possible with digital technology and preferable to a system based on
commercial mass media. He has contended in fact that the presence of
politically powerful, copyright-rich mass media imposes significant barriers to
the development of peer-to-peer information-sharing networks. In contrast, I
have argued that the commercial mass media play an important, and perhaps even
vital, role in liberal democracy by galvanizing public opinion, serving as a
watchdog against government and corporate wrongdoing, agenda-setting (which
enables public discourse), and serving as a relatively trustworthy source of
information. This paper seeks to push the ball forward on this issue. It first
isolates and enumerates the contributions that the commercial mass media are
said to make towards liberal democracy. It then briefly assesses the extent to
which the commercial mass media actually fulfills these constitutive functions.
It then asks whether alternative institutions might serve some or all of these
functions just as well or better. In so doing, it looks both to the past and
the future. First, it examines the political party-supported press that thrived
in the United States through much of the 19th century. Second, it examines
government-funded mass media. Third, it looks, skeptically, at possibilities
for peer-to-peer sharing of information and opinion in the digital network
environment. I conclude that, despite the weaknesses of commercial mass media,
an information policy suitable to liberal democracy should include a plurality
of types of voices, including commercial mass media.

  Contrasts","29th TPRC Conference, 2001 (Revised April 14, 2002)",,,"TPRC-2001-079","cs.CY",,"  In 1999, the FCC authorized direct access to INTELSAT, allowing INTELSAT's
U.S. customers and competitors to bypass INTELSAT's U.S. retail affiliate
(COMSAT), and to take satellite capacity at wholesale prices directly from
INTELSAT. This policy was modeled in many respects on the access and unbundling
requirements applicable to domestic incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs)
under the Telecommunications Act of 1996. At the same time, incumbent domestic
cable TV system operators have not been required to provide wholesale open
access to competitive Internet Service Providers (ISPs) seeking to provide
residential broadband Internet service through existing proprietary cable
facilities. Yet the policy arguments favoring open access to incumbent domestic
cable systems appear to be stronger than those favoring direct access to
INTELSAT.
  For example, it may be fairly debated whether entrenched cable system
operators are now positioned to unfairly leverage their dominance in the
multichannel video programming distribution (MVPD) market to thwart competition
in the broadband ISP market, as some cable open access advocates assert. In
contrast, it is clear that no analogous issues of tying were implicated by
INTELSAT in 1999, when its position in the international telecommunications
market was substantially nondominant and, in any event, it had no new product
to tie to its established offerings. Similarly, while it may be debated whether
or not a cable plant is a bottleneck facility that gatekeeps broadband Internet

  Telecommunications Act of 1996","29th TPRC Conference, 2001",,,"TPRC-2001-057","cs.CY",,"  A major goal of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is to promote competition
in both the local exchange and long distance wireline markets. In section 271
Congress permitted the Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) to enter the long
distance market only if they demonstrate to the FCC that they have complied
with the market-opening requirements of section 251. This paper examines the
logic behind section 271, to determine if it is a reasonable means of achieving
increased competition in both the local and long distance markets, given the
technical characteristics of the industry and the legal and informational
constraints on regulators who must ensure compliance. It also provides an
update on the extent of competitive entry in the local exchange market five
years after enactment of the Act.
  In this paper we examine a variety of schemes for ensuring BOC compliance
that Congress could have used. Given the characteristics of the industry and
the limitations on regulators' ability to observe BOC's efforts, we determine
that the use of a prize such as BOC entry into long distance is a superior
incentive mechanism. We further determine that conditioning a BOC's long
distance entry on its demonstrating compliance with section 251 is a logical
method of protecting the long distance market against a BOC discriminating
against long distance competitors once it has gained entry. The statistical
evidence we look at, using data we have collected on ILEC lines sold to CLECs
for POTS services, appears to confirm that section 271 has thus far been
effective in ensuring compliance.

to study the impact the Internet has had on election campaigning in Canada.
With the explosion of use the Net has seen since the 1997 general election,
Canadian federal parties stood at the threshold of a new age in election
campaigning. Pundits such as Rheingold (1993) have argued that the Internet
will provide citizens with a way to bypass traditional media and gain
unmediated access to each parties political message as well as providing a
forum for citizens to engage the parties, and each other in deliberative
debate.
  Through a longitudinal analysis of party web pages and telephone interviews
with party staffers, we analyze the role the Internet played in the election
campaigns of Canada's federal parties. Our findings indicate that the parties
are still focusing on providing online features that talk at the voter instead
of engaging them in any type of meaningful discourse. Most of these sites were
exceptionally similar in their structure and in the type of content they
provided. Generally, these sites served as digital archives for campaign
material created with other media in mind and despite the multimedia
capabilities of the Internet, these sites tended to be overwhelmingly text
oriented. In line with Stromer-Galley's (2000) discussion of why candidates in
the U.S. avoid online interaction, we also argue that little incentive exists
to motivate parties to engage in any meaningful interaction with voters online.

offer privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) and the U.S. has begun to enact
privacy legislation.
  But ""privacy"" is an ambiguous notion. In the liberal tradition, it is an
individualistic value protecting citizens from intrusion into a realm of
autonomy. A feminist critique suggests that the social utility of privacy is to
exclude certain issues from the public realm. Sociologists suggest that privacy
is about identity management, while political economists suggest that the most
salient privacy issue is the use of personal information to normalize and
rationalize populations according to the needs of capital.
  While PETs have been developed for use by individual consumers, recently
developers are focusing on the business to business market, where demand is
stoked by the existence of new privacy regulations. These new laws tend to
operationalize privacy in terms of ""personally identifiable information."" The
new generation of PETs reflect and reify that definition. This, in turn, has
implications for the everyday understandings of privacy and the constitution of
identity and social life.
  In particular, this socio-technical practice may strengthen the ability of
data holders to rationalize populations and create self-serving social
categories. At the same time, they may permit individuals to negotiate these
categories outside of panoptic vision. They may also encourage public
discussion and awareness of these created social categories.

top level domains in November 2000. In implementing proposals to expand the
name space, ICANN adopted an approach far different from Jon Postel's
lightweight proposals. ICANN staff, in setting the ground rules for considering
new gTLDs, emphasized that only a few applicants would be allowed in, and
imposed strict threshold requirements. Staff determined that the Board should
pick TLDs by looking at all relevant aspects of every proposal, and deciding
which ones presented the best overall combination of a variety of
incommensurable factors. Aspects of the resulting process were predictable:
Anyone familiar with the FCC comparative hearing process for broadcast licenses
can attest that this sort of ad hoc comparison is necessarily subjective,
lending itself to arbitrariness and biased application. Yet the process had
advantages that appealed to ICANN decision-makers. The Board members would be
free to take their best shots, in a situationally sensitive manner, at
advancing the policies they thought important. The approach allowed ICANN to
maintain the greatest degree of control. The end result, though, was a process
stunning in its arbitrariness, a bad parody of fact-bound, situationally
sensitive (rather than rules-based) decision-making.

are many advantages including a flexible response to market evolution,
accommodation to rapid technology change, and avoidance of costly coordination.
However, the market process does not necessarily lead to compatible standards,
especially when there is no clear market dominator. Standards Institutions
generally facilitate better communication among market participants, which may
discourage early and/or primitive incompatible standards to emerge in the
market. However, expenditures on institutional standards-setting can lead to
diminishing returns, or even be counter-productive because institutional
standards usually take longer to produce and are slower to respond to
technology development. Government agencies can specify compulsory standards to
avoid incompatibility. In addition, governments can tie their policy on
standardization closely with their industrial, trade, and/or regulatory
policies. However, many exogenous factors handicap a government's effective
involvement. Government often fails to respond to the dynamics of technology
development and consumer demand, and to pick up the ""right technology"". This

The diversification of access points and services enhanced users choices but
price rebalancing and lack of Universal Service Obligations (USO) to target
groups with special needs depressed the demand and threatened to exclude
significant parts of the population. The situation requires the reformulation
of USO incorporating all technological solutions existing in the market, and
factors from the consumer-demand accounting for the urban-rural continuum, and

negative network externality based on demands they place on the network.
Further we find that the marginal value of additional users is declining and
the marginal cost is increasing in the number of current users. This suggests
that multiple small networks may serve user communities more efficiently than
single monolithic networks and that network operators may wish to specialize in
their content and restrict membership based on capacity constraints and user

spectrum fees, on the pricing and diffusion of mobile communications services.
Seemingly exorbitant sums paid for 3G licenses in the UK, Germany in 2000 and
similarly high fees paid by U.S. carriers in the re-auctioning of PCS licenses
early in 2001 raised concerns as to the impacts of the market entry regime on
the mobile communications market.
  The evidence from the GSM and PCS markets reviewed in this paper suggests
that market entry fees do indeed influence the subsequent development of the
market. We discuss three potential transmission channels by which license fees
can influence the price and quantity of service sold in a wireless market: an
increase in average cost, an increase in incremental costs, and impacts of sunk
costs on the emerging market structure.
  From this conceptual debate, an empirical model is developed and tested using
cross-sectional data for the residential mobile voice market. We utilize a
structural equation approach, modeling the supply and demand relationships
subject to the constraint that supply equals demand. The results confirm the
existence of a positive effect of license fees on the cost of supply. However,
we also find that higher market concentration has a positive effect on the
overall supply in the market, perhaps supporting a Schumpeterian view that a
certain degree of market concentration facilitates efficiency.

information on cable television and the Internet, citizens' levels of political
knowledge have, at best, remained stagnant (Delli Carpini & Keeter, 1996).
Since the availability of entertainment content has increased too, the effect
of new media on knowledge and vote likelihood should be determined by people's
relative preferences for entertainment and information. Access to new media
should increase knowledge and vote likelihood among people who prefer news. At
the same time, it is hypothesized to have a negative effect on knowledge and
turnout for people who prefer entertainment content. Hypotheses are tested by
building a measure of Relative Entertainment Preference (REP) from existing NES
and Pew survey data. Results support the predicted interaction effect of media
environment (cable and/or Internet access) and motivation (REP) on political
knowledge and turnout. In particular, people who prefer entertainment to news
and have access to cable television and the Internet are less knowledgeable and
less likely to vote than any other group of people.

monitoring can detect such effects. We present data from a field test of
QoS-monitoring software now in development. We suggest QoS metrics to gauge
whether information ""walled gardens"" represent a real threat for dividing the
Internet into proprietary spaces.
  To demonstrate our proposal, we are placing our software on the computers of
a sample of broadband subscribers. The software periodically conducts a battery
of tests that assess the quality of connections from the subscriber's computer
to various content sites. Any systematic differences in connection quality
between affiliated and non-affiliated content sites would warrant research into
the behavioral implications of those differences.
  QoS monitoring is timely because the potential for the Internet to break into
a loose network of proprietary content domains appears stronger than ever.
Recent court rulings and policy statements suggest a growing trend towards
relaxed scrutiny of mergers and the easing or elimination of content ownership
rules. This policy environment could lead to a market with a small number of

cutoff independent when computed in certain, but not all, conditional

values are those that constrain the boundary geometry to a finite range of edge

equations. Conformal symmetry is broken on the worldsheet, but a subgroup of
the conformal group acts as the gauge group of the theory. Thus, the
Faddeev-Popov quantization procedure of fixing the gauge is applicable. We
calculate the Hamiltonian and show that, if properly quantized, the system
possesses a well-defined ground state and the spacing of its energy levels is
of order the Planck mass. This generalizes earlier results on a system of
maximally charged black holes to the case of continuous matter distributions.

most `natural' unitary representations of this group (like the regular
representation) on irreducible ones. The infinite-dimensional unitary group
U(infinity) is one of the basic examples of `big' groups whose irreducible
representations depend on infinitely many parameters. Our aim is to explain
what the harmonic analysis on U(infinity) consists of.
  We deal with unitary representations of a reasonable class, which are in 1-1
correspondence with characters (central, positive definite, normalized
functions on U(infinity)). The decomposition of any representation of this
class is described by a probability measure (called spectral measure) on the
space of indecomposable characters. The indecomposable characters were found by
Dan Voiculescu in 1976.
  The main result of the present paper consists in explicitly constructing a
4-parameter family of `natural' representations and computing their characters.
We view these representations as a substitute of the nonexisting regular
representation of U(infinity). We state the problem of harmonic analysis on
U(infinity) as the problem of computing the spectral measures for these
`natural' representations. A solution to this problem is given in the next
paper math/0109194, joint with Alexei Borodin.
  We also prove a few auxiliary general results. In particular, it is proved
that the spectral measure of any character of U(infinity) can be approximated
by a sequence of (discrete) spectral measures for the restrictions of the
character to the compact unitary groups U(N). This fact is a starting point for
computing spectral measures.

harmonic analysis on U(infinity) stated in the previous paper math/0109193. The
problem consists in computing spectral decomposition for a remarkable
4-parameter family of characters of U(infinity). These characters generate
representations which should be viewed as analogs of nonexisting regular
representation of U(infinity).
  The spectral decomposition of a character of U(infinity) is described by the
spectral measure which lives on an infinite-dimensional space Omega of
indecomposable characters. The key idea which allows us to solve the problem is
to embed Omega into the space of point configurations on the real line without
2 points. This turns the spectral measure into a stochastic point process on
the real line. The main result of the paper is a complete description of the
processes corresponding to our concrete family of characters. We prove that
each of the processes is a determinantal point process. That is, its
correlation functions have determinantal form with a certain kernel. Our
kernels have a special `integrable' form and are expressed through the Gauss
hypergeometric function.

of u are always roots of unity (math.QA/9812151, Theorem 4.8); i.e., some power

quasi-exponent of a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra H to be the order of

  The goal of the paper is to create a theory of quasi-exponent, which would be
parallel to the theory of the exponent developed in math.QA/9812151. In
particular, we give two other equivalent definitions of the quasi-exponent, and
prove that it is invariant under twisting. Furthermore, we prove that the
quasi-exponent of a finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebra H is equal to the
exponent of the group G(H) of grouplike elements of H. (In particular, the
order of the squared antipode of H divides exp(G(H)).) As an application, we
find that if H is obtained by twisting the quantum group at root of unity
U_q(g) then the order of any grouplike element in H divides the order of q.

  2, pp. 46-58",,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  It was demonstrated (gr-qc/9910036) that the gravitational and inertial
masses are correlated by an adimensional factor, which depends on the incident
(or emitted)radiation upon the particle. There is a direct correlation between
the radiation absorbed(or radiated) by the particle and its gravitational mass,
independently of the inertial mass. Only in the absence of electromagnetic
radiation the mentioned factor becomes equal to one. On the other hand, in
specific electromagnetic conditions, it can be reduced, nullified or made
negative. This means that there is the possibility of the gravitational masses
can be reduced, nullified or made negative by means of electromagnetic
radiation. This unexpected theoretical result was confirmed by an experiment
using Extra-Low Frequency(ELF) radiation on ferromagnetic material
(gr-qc/0005107). Recently another experiment using UV light on phosphorescent
plastic have confirmed the phenomenon. We present a complete explanation for
the alterations of the gravitational field in luminescent materials. This work
indicates that the alterations of the gravitational field can be sufficiently
strong to invert the gravity on luminescent materials.

plasma is studied when the thermal pressure is less than the magnetic field
pressure. In this situation the main nonlinear mechanism is the resonance
scattering of fast magneto-acoustic and Alfvenic waves on slow magneto-acoustic
waves. As a result, the former waves serve as the high-frequency waves with
respect to the latter ones so that the total number of HF waves - an adiabatic
invariant - conserves additionally. In the weak turbulence regime this
invariant is shown to generate the Kolmogorov type spectrum with a constant
flux of HF waves towards large-scale region. In the short-wave region another
Kolmogorov spectrum can be realized with a constant energy flux. The explicit
angle dependences for both types of turbulent spectra are found for the
propagation angles close to the direction of a mean magnetic field.

suitable choice of parameters, this system gives rise to a very narrow
structure at the laser frequency in the fluorescence spectrum which is not
present in the spectrum of a two-level atom. We find those parameter ranges by
a numerical analysis and use the results to derive analytical expressions for
the additional narrow peak. We also derive an exact expression for the peak
intensity under the assumption that a random telegraph model is applicable to
the system. This model and a simple spring model are then used to describe the
physical origins of the additional peak. Using these results, we explain the
