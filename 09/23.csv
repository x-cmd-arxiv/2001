presence of optical Dwarf Nova Oscillations (DNOs) over the range of 18 - 40 s.
There is a rapid increase in period near the end of outburst, at the same time
that the EUV falls almost to zero, which we attribute to propellering. The DNOs
return to a shorter period after this phase, but are very incoherent. The DNOs
show some modulation by the Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) that are also
occasionally present in the light curve. We interpret the QPOs as a prograde
travelling wave in the inner disc, which obscures and/or reprocesses radiation
from the central region. The model is applied to observations of OY Car and WZ
Sge.

of the plasma in gaseous nebulae. We present some of our own work that
illustrates the need for interactions between the themes of this conference -
astronomical data, atomic data, and plasma simulations. We undertook Infrared
Space Observatory (ISO) observations with the intent of better understanding
the effects of density variations in nebulae, particularly planetary nebulae
(PNs), by determining average electron densities from the flux ratios of
several fine-structure, IR emission lines. Instead, we are able to ascertain
only minor density information because of several instances of the observed
line flux ratios being out of range of the theoretical predictions using
current atomic data. In these cases, the ISO data cannot presently be used to
derive electron density, but rather provide direction for needed improvements
in the atomic collision strengths.
  We have detected an unidentified (uid) strong emission line in an ISO/SWS
spectrum of the Orion Nebula. The line has a rest wavelength
2.89350$\pm$0.00003 $\mu$m. A long-slit UKIRT observation confirms the presence
of this line and shows that the emission is spatially extended and appears to
be coincident with the brightest part of the ionized region. We do not detect
the uid line in our SWS02 spectra of any of the several bright PNs which we
observed for a comparable time. The need for basic atomic data, in this case
wavelengths to aid species identification, is paramount for future progress.
  We look toward the future with a brief synopsis of upcoming or planned IR
missions.

copiously produced by VMSs), but not in other elements such as carbon (which
should not), in agreement with this hypothesis. We then combine the
corresponding level of prompt initial enrichment with models of VMS
nucleosynthetic yields and spectra to estimate the corresponding ionizing
fluxes. The result suggests that there may have been enough VMS activity to
reionize the universe. The unusually hard spectrum of VMSs would imply a
different reionization history from canonical models. HeII could have been
reionized at high redshift, only to recombine as a subsequent generation of
stars formed with a ``normal'' initial mass function.

K\alpha line to have FWHM of 1720+/-360 km/s which, under the simple assumption
of virialized system, suggest that this narrow line is emitted between the
broad line region and the narrow line region. We do not detect any broad
component for the Fe K\alpha line though such component was observed in
previous ASCA observations of this object. Our results suggest an evolution in
the broad Fe K\alpha line that took place from the observations in 1996 to the

absorption lines and several dozen emission lines from the H-like and He-like
ions of N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, and S as well as from Fe_XVII to Fe_XXIV L-shell
transitions. All these features can be modeled by a multi-component,
outflowing, photoionized absorber. There is no evidence (or need in the model)
for soft X-ray emission lines from a relativistic accretion disk as have been
proposed to be seen in a few other AGNs.

as a function of temperature, dc field, dc field sweep rate, and the amplitude
of ac field. The Nb sample was excited by an amplitude modulated ac field.
Under a stationary regime, the rectified signal appears only for magnetic
fields ($H_0$) in the range $H_{c2}<H_0<H_{c3}$ . However, when the dc field
was swept slowly, the rectified signal appears at $H_0>H_{c1}$. This experiment
shows that the amplitude of the rectified signal is two orders of magnitude
larger than the amplitude of the signal seen under stationary field conditions.
Moreover, the amplitude of the rectified signal is a power function of the
sweep rate, with the power exponent close to 1.

regulatory forbearance, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 finally articulated
a clear standard for the FCC's public interest standard, one of the most
protean concepts in communications. This seeming clarity has not, however,
inhibited intense political conflict over the term. This paper examines public
and regulatory debate over the AOL Time Warner merger as an example of the way
in which the linkage between competitions and commons policy becomes relevant
to communications policy, particularly in relation to mass media, and discusses
interpretations of the public interest in the current FCC. The paper proposes
that the Telecom Act's goal of fostering economic competition among information
service providers, and the democratic ideal of nurturing public relationships
and behaviors can be linked. Competition policy that creates the opportunity
for untrammeled interactivity also provides a sine qua non to nurture the
social phenomenon of the commons. The linked concepts of competition and
commons could also provide useful ways to interpret the public interest in
policy arenas as spectrum allocation and intellectual property.

the direction of increasing direct citizen participation and forcing government
officials to respond more quickly to voter concerns. A recent California
initiative with these objectives would authorize use of encrypted digital
signatures over the Internet to qualify candidates, initiatives, and other
ballot measures. Proponents of Internet signature gathering say it will
significantly lower the cost of qualifying initiatives and thereby reduce the
influence of organized, well-financed interest groups. They also believe it
will increase both public participation in the political process and public
understanding about specific measures. However, opponents question whether
Internet security is adequate to prevent widespread abuse and argue that the
measure would create disadvantages for those who lack access to the Internet.
Beyond issues of security, cost, and access lie larger questions about the
effects of Internet signature gathering on direct democracy. Would it encourage
greater and more informed public participation in the political process? Or
would it flood voters with ballot measures and generally worsen current
problems with the initiative process itself? Because we lack good data on these
questions, answers to them today are largely conjectural. We can be fairly
sure, however, that Internet petition signing, like Internet voting, will have
unintended consequences.
