raise the neutrino luminosity. Weak magnetism also changes the emitted spectrum

$\bar\nu_x$ will be emitted about 7% hotter than $\nu_x$ because $\bar\nu_x$
have longer mean free paths. Likewise weak magnetism may increase the
$\bar\nu_e$ temperature by of order 10%. This increase in temperature coupled
with the increase in neutrino luminosity should increase the heating in the low

important for the success of an explosion. It is important to check our results

After exploring various scenarios that might explain the observed X-ray
lightcurve with a t^-0.27 rate of decline, we present a coherent picture in
terms of the interaction of the SN shock front with the CSM deposited by the
progenitor's stellar wind. During the observed period, the SN shell has reached
a radius of 3x10^17 cm from the site of the explosion, corresponding to ~10^4
years in the progenitors stellar wind history. Our analysis shows that the
mass-loss rate of the progenitor has decreased constantly from \dot{M} =
4x10^-4 to 4x10^-5 M_sun/yr (v_w/10 km/s) during the late stage of the
evolution. Assuming a spherically symmetric expansion, the circumstellar matter
density profile is found to be significantly flatter (\rho_csm \propto r^-1.63)
than expected for a constant mass-loss rate and constant wind velocity profile
(r^-2). The observed evolution either reflects a decrease in the mass-loss

accomplish this efficiently, we minimized the iterations in the Hartree

methods. This method has the effect of reducing the computation time
significantly. Inclusion of higher Landau states gives us much more accurate
data for inner orbitals unlike other methods based on the adiabatic

(1999a,b). When coupled with its inferred distance (5<d<30 kpc) and
line-of-sight velocity (v=-100 to -200 km/s), Complex C appeared to represent
the first direct evidence for infalling low-metallicity gas onto the Milky Way,
which could provide the bulk of the fuel for star formation in the Galaxy. We
have extended the abundance analysis of Complex C to encompass five sightlines.
We detect SII absorption in three targets (Mrk 290, Mrk 817, and Mrk 279); the
resulting [SII/HI] values range from -0.36 (Mrk 279) to -0.48 (Mrk 817) to
-1.10 (Mrk 290). Our preliminary OI FUSE analysis of the Mrk 817 sightline also
supports the conclusion that metallicities as high as 0.3 times solar are
encountered within Complex C. These results complicate an interpretation of
Complex C as infalling low-metallicity Galactic fuel. Ionization corrections
for HII and SIII cannot easily reconcile the higher apparent metallicities
along the Mrk 817 and Mrk 279 sightlines with that seen toward Mrk 290, since
H-alpha emission measures preclude the existence of sufficient HII. If gas
along the other lines of sight has a similar pressure and temperature to that
sampled toward Mrk 290, the predicted H-alpha emission measures would be 900
mR. It may be necessary to reclassify Complex C as mildly enriched Galactic
waste from the Milky Way or processed gas torn from a disrupted neighboring
dwarf, as opposed to low-metallicity Galactic fuel.

monitored at X-ray, optical and radio wavelengths. We divide the outburst
sequence into five phases and discuss their multiwavelength properties. The
outburst starts with a hard X-ray spike, while the soft X-ray flux rises with a
longer timescale. We suggest that the onset of the outburst is determined by an
increased mass transfer rate from the companion star, but the outburst
morphology is determined by the distribution of specific angular momentum in
the accreting matter. The companion in XTE J1550-564 is likely to be an active
magnetic star, with a surface field strong enough to influence the dynamics of
mass transfer. We suggest that its magnetic field can create a magnetic bag
capable of confining gas inside the Roche lobe of the primary. The impulsive
rise in the hard X-rays is explained by the inflow of material with low angular
momentum onto the black hole, on a free-fall timescale, when the magnetic
confinement breaks down. At the same time, high angular momentum matter,
transferred via ordinary Roche-lobe overflow, is responsible for the formation
of a disk.

Monte-Carlo simulations of particle propagation in stochastic magnetic fields

the turbulent magnetic component. We confirm the extrapolation to high
turbulence levels of the scaling predicted by the quasi-linear approximation
for the scattering frequency and parallel diffusion coefficient at low
rigidity. We show that the widely used Bohm diffusion coefficient does not
provide a satisfactory approximation to diffusion even in the extreme case
where the mean field vanishes. We find that diffusion also takes place for
particles with Larmor radii larger than the coherence length of the turbulence.
We argue that transverse diffusion is much more effective than predicted by the
quasi-linear approximation, and appears compatible with chaotic magnetic
diffusion of the field lines. We provide numerical estimates of the Kolmogorov
length and magnetic line diffusion coefficient as a function of the level of

activity-dependent synaptic development: Neighbor neurons whose activity is
correlated, on average develop a new connection while uncorrelated neighbors
tend to disconnect. As a result, robust self-organization of the network

consider classical statistical mechanics and recall the relation between the
reducible part of the classical cluster integrals and the mean-field; we
introduce an alternative method to obtain the linear density contribution to
the mean-field, which is based on the notion of tree-diagrams and provides a
preview of the subsequent quantum calculations. We then proceed to study
quantum particles with Boltzmann statistics (distinguishable particles) and
show that each Ursell operator Un with n greater or equal to 3 contains a
``tree-reducible part'', which groups naturally with U2 through a linear chain
of binary interactions; this part contributes to the associated mean-field
experienced by particles in the fluid. The irreducible part, on the other hand,
corresponds to the effects associated with three (or more) particles
interacting all together at the same time. We then show that the same algebra
holds in the case of Fermi or Bose particles, and discuss physically the role
of the exchange cycles, combined with interactions. Bose condensed systems are
not considered at this stage. The similarities and differences between
Boltzmann and quantum statistics are illustrated by this approach, in contrast

includes the effects both of temperature-dependent dynamical correlations and
of statistical correlations corresponding to thermal phonon-roton and

$\chi(G)$, the chromatic number of a given graph $G$, equals one of the $k$
elements of the set $M_k$ exactly. In 1987, Wagner \cite{wag:j:min-max} proved
that $\exactcolor{M_k}$ is $\bhlevel{2k}$-complete, where $M_k = \{6k+1, 6k+3,

over $\np$. In particular, for $k = 1$, it is DP-complete to determine whether
$\chi(G) = 7$, where $\DP = \bhlevel{2}$. Wagner raised the question of how
small the numbers in a $k$-element set $M_k$ can be chosen such that
$\exactcolor{M_k}$ still is $\bhlevel{2k}$-complete. In particular, for $k =
1$, he asked if it is DP-complete to determine whether $\chi(G) = 4$. In this
note, we solve this question of Wagner and determine the precise threshold $t
\in \{4, 5, 6, 7\}$ for which the problem $\exactcolor{\{t\}}$ jumps from NP to
DP-completeness: It is DP-complete to determine whether $\chi(G) = 4$, yet
$\exactcolor{\{3\}}$ is in $\np$. More generally, for each $k \geq 1$, we show
that $\exactcolor{M_k}$ is $\bhlevel{2k}$-complete for $M_k = \{3k+1, 3k+3,...,
5k-1\}$.

  13 pages, 9 figures",,"10.1109/ASE.2001.989822",,"cs.SE",,"  Test suites are designed to validate the operation of a system against
requirements. One important aspect of a test suite design is to ensure that
system operation logic is tested completely. A test suite should drive a system
through all abstract states to exercise all possible cases of its operation.
This is a difficult task. Code coverage tools support test suite designers by
providing the information about which parts of source code are covered during
system execution. Unfortunately, code coverage tools produce only source code
coverage information. For a test engineer it is often hard to understand what
the noncovered parts of the source code do and how they relate to requirements.
We propose a generic approach that provides design coverage of the executed
software simplifying the development of new test suites. We demonstrate our
approach on common design abstractions such as statecharts, activity diagrams,
message sequence charts and structure diagrams. We implement the design
coverage using Third Eye tracing and trace analysis framework. Using design
coverage, test suites could be created faster by focussing on untested design
elements.

spherically symmetric solution give us a ball of the polarized spacetime foam
filled with the confined electric field. It is shown that the full energy of

study of the external wave packet model. In particular, we show that the latter
includes stationary models as a subcase. In addition, we explicitly compute
decoherence terms, which destroy interferences, in order to prove that the
coherence length can be increased without bound by more accurate energy
measurements. We show that decoherence originates not only in the width and in
the separation of wave packets, but also in their spreading through space-time.
In this review, we neither assume the relativistic limit nor the stability of
oscillating particles, so that the oscillation formula derived with
field-theoretical methods can be applied not only to neutrinos but also to
neutral K and B mesons. Finally, we discuss oscillations of correlated
particles in the same framework.

allow for any combination of fractal dimension and Hurst exponent. We
synthesize images from these models, with arbitrary fractal properties and
