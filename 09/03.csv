are important diagnostics of the relative abundances and overall metallicity in
the gas. Here we present new theoretical predictions for several UV BELs. We
focus specifically on the relative nitrogen abundance as a metallicity
indicator, based on the expected secondary enrichment of nitrogen at
metallicities Z > 0.2 Z_o. Among the lines we consider, N III] 1750/O III]
1664, N V 1240/(C IV 1549 + O VI 1034) and N V/He II 1640 are the most robust
diagnostics. We argue, in particular, that the average N V BEL is not dominated
by scattered Ly-alpha photons from a broad absorption line wind. We then
compare our calculated line ratios with observations from the literature. The
results support earlier claims that the gas-phase metallicities near quasars
are typically near or several times above the solar value. We conclude that
quasar activity is preceded by, or coeval with, an episode of rapid and
extensive star formation in the surrounding galactic (or proto-galactic)
nuclei. Chemical evolution models of these environments suggest that, to reach
Z > Z_o in well-mixed interstellar gas, the star formation must have begun >
10^8 yr before the observed quasar activity.

reflected in the surface abundances of low-mass stars and thereby detailed
information on the nucleosynthesis in the first generations of supernovae is
preserved. Characteristic patterns and substructures are therefore expected to
be found, apart from the large scatter behaviour, in the distributions of stars
when displayed in diagrams relating different element abundance ratios. These
patterns emerge from specific variations with progenitor stellar mass of the
supernova yields and it is demonstrated that the patterns are insensitive to
the initial mass function (IMF) even though the relative density of stars
within the patterns may vary. An analytical theory of the formation of patterns
is presented and it is shown that from a statistical point of view the

to empirically determine supernova yields from the information on relative

through the accretion-ejection instability undergo expansion due to their high

and form strong shock, which accelerates a group of electrons to be
relativistic. Then flares are formed. This model has advances in two aspects:
shock acceleration and self-consistent injection. We derive an analytical
formula of the injection function of relativistic electrons based on the
Sedov's law. We calculate the time-dependent spectrum of relativistic electrons
in such an expanding blob. The light-travel effect, the evolution of the
electron spectrum due to energy loss, and the escape of relativistic electrons
from the radiating region are considered, as well as the expansion (at
sub-relativistic speed) of the coasting blob. A large number of light curves
spanning wide spaces of parameters have been given in this paper. Regarding the
symmetry, relative amplitude, duration of a flare, and the time lag between
peak fluxes, we find four basic kinds of light curves for the non-expanding
blob, and seven basic kinds of light curves for the expanding blob. We also
calculate the evolution of the photon spectrum from both non-expanding and
expanding blobs. Different shapes in the phase of decreasing luminosity are
then obtained for different parameter values. The photon index, $\alpha_{\rm
ph}$, keeps constant for non-expanding blobs when luminosity decreases, whereas
$\alpha_{\rm ph}$ continues to decrease after the luminosity reaches its
maximum for expanding blobs. It is expected that we can extract the information
of ejected blobs from the observed light curves based on the present model.

galaxies exhibit a significant radio excess and 50% (7/14) of the galaxies
which lie above the radio-FIR correlation by more than 1 sigma have compact
radio cores. The emission from the cores is too weak to account for this radio
excess and there is no evidence that the radio luminosity of the compact cores
is correlated with the FIR galaxy luminosity.

two thirds (6/9) exhibiting Seyfert-like optical emission line ratios, and the

$|\vg|$ decreases with time and eventually becomes $<g_0$, the threshold below
which MOND is dominant. If the Newtonian initial density field has a power-law

large scale. At early times MOND tends to drive the density power-spectrum
towards $k^{-1}$, independent of its shape in the Newtonian regime. We use
N-body simulations to solve the MOND equations of motion starting from initial
conditions with a CDM power-spectrum. MOND with the standard value $g_0=10^{-8}

The wavelet cross-correlation coefficient strongly depends on the scale. The
classical cross-correlation coefficient can be misleading if a bright, extended

of the scaling and cross-correlation characteristics of 9 optical and radio
maps of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 6946 is presented. The wavelet spectra
allow to separate structures on different scales like spiral arms and diffuse

magnitude of the viscosity parameter, $\alpha$, on the structure of the slim

temperature of the disk, $\Rin$, the size of the region emitting blackbody
radiation with $\Tin$, and $p\equiv -{\rm dln} T_{\rm eff}/{\rm dln}~r$, the
slope of the effective temperature distribution. It was founded that the
estimated $\Tin$ slightly increases as $\alpha$ increases. This is because the
larger the magnitude of viscosity is, the larger becomes the accretion velocity
and, hence, the more enhanced becomes advective energy transport, which means
less efficient radiative cooling and thus higher temperatures. Furthermore we
check different viscosity prescriptions with the form of the viscous stress
tensor of $t_{r \varphi} = -\alpha \beta^{\mu}p_{\rm total}$, where $\beta$ is
the ratio of gas pressure to total pressure, and $\mu$ is a parameter ($0 \le
\mu \le 1$). For $\mu=0$ we have previously found that as luminosity approaches
the Eddington, $L_{\rm E$, $\Rin$ decreases below 3$\rg$ (with $r_{\rm g}$
being Schwarzschild radius) and the effective temperature becomes flatter,
$T_{\rm eff} \propto r^{-1/2}$. Such a slim-disk nature does not appear when
$\mu$ is large, $\mu \sim 0.5$, even at $L_{\rm E}$. Hence, the temperature of
the innermost region of the disk sensitively depends on the $\mu$ value. We can
rule out the case with large $\mu~(\sim 0.5)$, since it will not be able to
produce a drop in $\Rin$ with an increase in luminosity as was observed in an

this using the model of the L1544 proposed by Ciolek & Basu (2000) and by
comparing the observed velocities with those expected on the basis of their

that the velocity gradient along the minor axis and the line broadening toward

the idea that amipolar diffusion across field lines is one of the basic
processes leading to gravitational collapse. However, line widths are
significantly narrower than observed and are better reproduced by the Myers &

off-centre, over 64 kpc$^{3}$ at a rate of $4.9\times 10^{44} \ergs$ for 50

dragging behind it material from the cluster core. The rising bubble pushes
with it a shell of gas which expands and cools. We find the appearance of the

with recent {\it Chandra} observations of cluster cores. Toward the end of the

model which predicts the abundances of these species as a function of radius in
a spherically symmetric model with radial density distribution inferred from
the observations of dust emission at millimeter wavelengths and dust absorption
in the infrared. Our main observational finding is that the N(N2D+)/N(N2H+)
column density ratio is of order 0.2 towards the L1544 dust peak as compared to
N(DCO+)/N(HCO+) = 0.04. We conclude that this result as well as the general
finding that N2H+ and N2D+ correlate well with the dust is caused by CO being
depleted to a much higher degree than molecular nitrogen in the high density
core of L1544. Depletion also favors deuterium enhancement and thus N2D+, which
traces the dense and highly CO-depleted core nucleus, is much more enhanced
than DCO+. Our models do not uniquely define the chemistry in the high density
depleted nucleus of L1544 but they do suggest that the ionization degree is a
few times 10^{-9} and that the ambipolar diffusion time scale is locally
similar to the free fall time. It seems likely that the lower limit which one
obtains to ionization degree by summing all observable molecular ions is not a
great underestimate of the true ionization degree. We predict that atomic
oxygen is abundant in the dense core and, if so, H3O+ may be the main ion in

frequent flare-like events in a majority of the pixels in quiet regions of the
solar corona. The changes in coronal emission measure indicate impulsive
heating of new material to coronal temperatures. These heating or evaporation
events are candidate signatures of ""nanoflares"" or ""microflares"" proposed to
interpret the high temperature and the very existence of the corona. The energy
distribution of these micro-events reported in the literature differ widely,
and so do the estimates of their total energy input into the corona. Here we
analyze the assumptions of the different methods, compare them by using the
same data set and discuss their results.
  We also estimate the different forms of energy input and output, keeping in
mind that the observed brightenings are most likely secondary phenomena. A
rough estimate of the energy input observed by EIT on the SoHO satellite is of
the order of 10% of the total radiative output in the same region. It is
considerably smaller for the two reported TRACE observations. The discrepancy
can be explained partially by different thresholds for flare detection. There
is agreement on the slope and the absolute value of the distribution if the
same method were used and a numerical error corrected. The extrapolation of the
power law to unobserved energies that are many orders of magnitude smaller
remains questionable. Nevertheless, these micro-events and unresolved smaller
events are currently the best source of information on the heating process of
the corona.

  Accepted for publication in Astron. Astrophys",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20011215",,"astro-ph",,"  Results of a systematic study of substructure in X-ray surface brightness
distributions of a combined sample of 470 REFLEX+BCS clusters of galaxies are
presented. The fully automized morphology analysis is based on data of the 3rd
processing of the ROSAT All-Sky survey (RASS-3). After correction for several
systematic effects, $52\pm 7$ percent of the REFLEX+BCS clusters are found to
be substructured in metric apertures of 1 Mpc radius ($H_0= 50 {\rm km} {\rm
s}^{-1} {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$). Future simulations will show statistically which mass
spectrum of major and minor mergers contributes to this number. Another
important result is the discovery of a substructure-density relation, analogous
to the morphology-density relation for galaxies. Here, clusters with asymmetric
or multi-modal X-ray surface brightness distributions are located
preferentially in regions with higher cluster number densities. The
substructure analyses techniques are used to compare the X-ray morphology of 53
clusters with radio halos and relics, and 22 cooling flow clusters with the
REFLEX+BCS reference sample. After careful equalization of the different
`sensitivities' of the subsamples to substructure detection it is found that
the halo and relic sample tends to show more often multi-modal and elongated
X-ray surface brightness distributions compared to the REFLEX+BCS reference
sample. The cooling flow clusters show more often circular symmetric and
unimodal distributions compared to the REFLEX+BCS and the halo/relic reference
samples. Both findings further support the idea that radio halos and relics are
triggered by merger events, and that pre-existing cooling flows might be
disrupted by recent major mergers.

motion of the X-ray source): the source is still in the spin-up state, as since
1988. The pulse profile is double peaked, although significant variations of
the relative intensity of the peaks with energy are present. The broad band
(0.12-100 keV) out-of-eclipse spectrum is well described by an absorbed power
law modified by a high energy cutoff at \sim 16 keV (e-folding energy \sim 10
keV) plus an iron emission line at \sim 6.4 keV. A cyclotron line at \sim 21
keV is present. The width of the line is consistent with thermal Doppler
broadening at the temperature of the exponential cutoff. We searched for the
presence of the second harmonic, previously reported for this source. We found
no evidence of lines at \sim 42 keV, although an absorption feature at 51 keV
seems to be present (at 99% confidence level). A soft excess, modelled by a
blackbody with a temperature of \sim 0.08 keV could be present, probably
emitted by the matter at the magnetosphere. We also performed a spectral
analysis during the X-ray eclipse. The spectral evolution during the eclipse
can be well described by a progressive covering of the primary Comptonization
spectrum that is scattered into the line of sight. During the deep eclipse this
spectrum also softens, suggesting that the dust-scattered component becomes
important. An alternative, more complex model, with an emission iron line and
scattered components (as the one that has been used to fit the eclipse of
Centaurus X-3), also gives a good fit of the deep-eclipse data.

system with different macroscopic states on either side of the piston, we
determine its effective diffusion coefficient from the asymptotic behavior of
the variance of its position, as well as the leading behavior of the other
moments about the mean. Finally, we present an interpretation of the effective
noise arising from the dynamics of the two gases, and thence that of the
stochastic process to which the position of any particle in the system reduces
in the thermodynamic limit.

intervals of time; and interrupted evolution, in which the variate is also
re-set in the quiescent state to a random value drawn from a fixed

are the sole forms of quantum noise in interferometric gravitational wave
detectors that operate near or below the standard quantum limit, if one filters
the interferometer output appropriately. No additional noise arises from the
test masses' initial quantum state or from reduction of the test-mass state due
to measurement of the interferometer output or from the uncertainty principle
associated with the test-mass state. Two features of interferometers are
central to these conclusions: (i) The interferometer output (the photon number
flux N(t) entering the final photodetector) commutes with itself at different
times in the Heisenberg Picture, [N(t), N(t')] = 0, and thus can be regarded as
classical. (ii) This number flux is linear in the test-mass initial position
and momentum operators x_o and p_o, and those operators influence the measured
photon flux N(t) in manners that can easily be removed by filtering -- e.g., in
most interferometers, by discarding data near the test masses' 1 Hz swinging
freqency. The test-mass operators x_o and p_o contained in the unfiltered
output N(t) make a nonzero contribution to the commutator [N(t), N(t')]. That
contribution is cancelled by a nonzero commutation of the photon shot noise and
radiation-pressure noise, which also are contained in N(t). This cancellation
of commutators is responsible for the fact that it is possible to derive an
interferometer's standard quantum limit from test-mass considerations, and
independently from photon-noise considerations. These conclusions are true for
a far wider class of measurements than just gravitational-wave interferometers.
To elucidate them, this paper presents a series of idealized thought
experiments that are free from the complexities of real measuring systems.

extremely high baryon density (O(10^{10} rho_0) with rho_0 being the normal
nuclear matter density), our model becomes equivalent to the usual perturbative
QCD treatment and the gap is shown to have a sharp peak near the Fermi surface
due to the weak-coupling nature of QCD. On the other hand, the gap is a smooth
function of the momentum at lower densities (O(10 rho_0)) due to strong color
magnetic and electric interactions. To study the structural change of Cooper
pairs from high density to lower density, quark correlation in the color
superconductor is studied both in the momentum space and in the coordinate
space. The size of the Cooper pair is shown to become comparable to the
averaged inter-quark distance at low densities. Also, effects of the
momentum-dependent running coupling and the antiquark pairing, which are both
small at high density, are shown to be non-negligible at low densities. These

investigated lepton flavor violating (LFV) processes in a SU(5) supersymmetric
grand unified theory with right-handed neutrino. The current experimental upper
bound for $\mu \to e\gamma$ process gives already some constraint on the model.
Correlation between $\mu \to e \gamma$ and the SUSY contribution to the muon
anomalous magnetic moment is also discussed. Future LFV experiments will give
considerable impacts on this type of SUSY GUT models equipped with seesaw
neutrino mass generation.

previous works, is continued. The gluon propagator is modified as consequence
of a soft gluon pairs condensate in the vacuum. The modified Feynman rules for
$\alpha=1$ are shown, and some physical magnitudes calculated with them. The
mean value of $G^{2}$, gluon masses and the effective potential are calculated
up to the $g^2$ order, improving previous calculations. In connection with the
gluon self-energy it follows that the gluonic mass shell becomes tachyonic in
the considered approximation. The constituent quarks masses, produced by the
influence of the condensate, are also calculated. Results of the order of 1/3
of the nucleon mass, are obtained for the constituent masses of the up and down
quarks. In addition, the predicted flavour dependence of the calculated quarks
masses turns out to be the appropriate to reproduce the spectrum of the ground
states within the various groups of hadronic resonances, through the simple
addition of their constituent quark masses. Finally, the generalization of the
theory for arbitrary values of the $\alpha$ gauge parameter is explored.

production at hadron colliders, in view of the extraction of footprints of BFKL
physics. We argue that at Tevatron energies, dijet production at large rapidity
intervals is still subasymptotic with respect to the BFKL regime, thus the
cross section is strongly dependent on the various cuts applied in the
experimental setup. In addition, the choice of equal transverse momentum cuts
on the tagging jets makes the cross section dependent on large logarithms of
non-BFKL origin, and thus may spoil the BFKL analysis. For vector boson
production in association with two jets, we argue that the configurations that
are kinematically favoured tend to have the vector boson forward in rapidity.
Thus $W + 2$ jet production lends itself naturally to extensions to the
high-energy limit.

nontrivial flow in the 3-dimensional boundary field theory. We find that these

gauging of N=8 supergravity by two successive SL(8,R) transformations of the de
Wit-Nicolai theory, that is, compact SO(8) gauged supergravity. The theory
found earlier has local SU(8)x CSO(p, q, r)^{+} gauge symmetry as well as local
N=8 supersymmetry. The gauge group CSO(p, q, r)^{+} is spontaneously reduced to
its maximal compact subgroup SO(p)^{+} x SO(q)^{+} x U(1)^{+r(r-1)/2}. The
T-tensor we obtain describes a two-parameter family of gauged N=8 supergravity
from which one can construct A_1 and A_2 tensors. The effective nontrivial
scalar potential can be written as the difference of positive definite terms.
We examine the scalar potential for critical points at which the expectation
value of the scalar field is SO(p)^{+} x SO(q)^{+} x SO(r)^{+} invariant. It
turns out that there is no new extra critical point. However, we do have flow
equations and domain-wall solutions for the scalar fields are the gradient flow

expansion is investigated. It is formed as a coherent superposition of zero
momentum gluon pairs and shows Lorentz as well as global $SU(3)$ symmetries.
The general form of the Wick theorem is discussed, and it follows that the
gluon and ghost propagators determined by the proposed vacuum state, coincides
with the ones used in an alternative of the usual perturbation theory proposed
in a previous work, and reviewed here. Therefore, the ability of such a
procedure of producing a finite gluon condensation parameter already in the
first orders of perturbation theory is naturally explained. It also follows
that this state satisfies the physicality condition of the BRST procedure in
its Kugo and Ojima formulation. A brief review of the canonical quantization
for gauge fields, developed by Kugo and Ojima, is done and the value of the
gauge parameter $\alpha$ is fixed to $\alpha=1$ where the procedure is greatly
simplified. Therefore, after assuming that the adiabatic connection of the
interaction does not take out the state from the interacting physical space,
the predictions of the perturbation expansion for the physical quantities, at
the value $\alpha=1$, should have meaning. The validity of this conclusion
solves the gauge dependence indeterminacy remained in the proposed perturbation
expansion.

operator, D(A), for the electron dynamics together with the usual self-energy
of the quantized ultraviolet cutoff electromagnetic field A -- in the Coulomb
gauge. There are no positrons because the electron wave functions are
constrained to lie in the positive spectral subspace of some Dirac operator, D,
but the model is defined for any number, N, of electrons, and hence describes a
true many-body system. In addition to the electrons there are a number, K, of
fixed nuclei with charges \leq Z. If the fields are not quantized but are
classical, it was shown earlier that such a model is always unstable (the
ground state energy E=-\infty) if one uses the customary D(0) to define the
electron space, but is stable (E > - const.(N+K)) if one uses D(A) itself
(provided the fine structure constant \alpha and Z are not too large). This
result is extended to quantized fields here, and stability is proved for \alpha
=1/137 and Z \leq 42. This formulation of QED is somewhat unusual because it
means that the electron Hilbert space is inextricably linked to the photon Fock
space. But such a linkage appears to better describe the real world of photons

cubic-quintic Ginzburg-Landau equation with an anisotropy of a novel type: the
equation is diffractive in one direction, and diffusive in the other. By means
of systematic simulations, we demonstrate that the model gives rise to
\emph{stable} fully localized 2D pulses, which are spatiotemporal ``light
bullets'', existing due to the simultaneous balances between diffraction,
dispersion, and Kerr nonlinearity, and between linear and quintic losses and
cubic gain. A stability region of the 2D pulses is identified in the system's
parameter space. Besides that, we also find that the model generates 1D
patterns in the form of simple localized stripes, which may be stable, or may
exhibit an instability transforming them into oblique stripes with zigzags. The
straight and oblique stripes may stably coexist with the 2D pulse, but not with
each other.

Bohm have changed their initial enigmatic meanings and acquired quite
reasonable outlines of real and measurable characteristics. The start viewpoint
was the following: All the phenomena, which we observe in the quantum world,
should reflect structural properties of the real space. Thus the scale 10^{-28}
cm at which three fundamental interactions (electromagnetic, weak, and strong)
intersect has been treated as the size of a building block of the space. The
appearance of a massive particle is associated with a local deformation of the
cellular space, i.e. deformation of a cell. The mechanics of a moving particle
that has been constructed is deterministic by its nature and shows that the
particle interacts with cells of the space creating elementary excitations
called ""inertons"". The further study has disclosed that inertons are a
substructure of the matter waves which are described by the orthodox wave
\psi-function formalism. The concept has allowed resolving the spin problem.
The theory, or more exactly, the existence of inertons, has been verified
experimentally: in rarefied gases, inerton clouds of atoms' electrons interact
with a strong laser pulse; in a solid, atom's inertons induce an additional
harmonic potential that contributes to the interatomic interaction (metal
specimens and the KIO_3*HIO_3 crystal).
