1223 early-type galaxies. We also analyze the line strength indices for a

find: i) that the Mg_2-sigma relation for Es and S0s are nearly the same, with
both populations showing comparable scatter, and ii) a marginal difference in
the slope of the Mg_2-sigma relation for cluster and field early-type galaxies.
However, we suggest that before interpreting such a difference in the framework
of a mass-metallicity relation, it is important to take into account the
effects of rotation in the Mg_2-sigma relation. Our preliminary results
indicate that once the rotation effects are minimized by choosing a sample
containing only slow rotators, the Mg_2-sigma relation is similar both for
isolated and clustered galaxies. More data on rotational velocities of
early-type galaxies are needed to confirm this result. For spiral bulges, we
find that their locus in the Mg_2-sigma plane lies always below the one
occupied by early-type galaxies.

Schwarzschild ellipsoid plane parallel models and the epicyclic model. This
more realistic model is taylored to account for local neighbourhood density and
velocity distribution.
  The first model is fully investigated both analytically and via means of a

formally its equivalent. The effect of noise and incompleteness in apparent

h, but relatively weak limits on the fraction of the cosmic matter density in
baryons Omega_b/Omega_m. The CMB anisotropy data alone set poor constraints on
the cosmological constant and Hubble constant because of a `geometrical
degeneracy' among parameters. Furthermore, if tensor modes are allowed, the CMB
data allow a wide range of values for the physical densities in baryons and
cold dark matter. Combining the CMB and 2dFGRS data sets helps to break both
the geometrical and tensor mode degeneracies. The values of the parameters
derived here are consistent with the predictions of the simplest models of

diverges can often be described by a scaling function. We develop the method of
q-linear approximants in order to extract the approximate scaling behaviour of
polygon models when an exact solution is not known. We test the validity of our
method by approximating exactly solvable q-linear polygon models. This leads to
scaling functions for a number of q-linear polygon models, notably generalized

of an $N\to\infty$ limit of U(N) gauge theory on a commutative torus. The
magnetic flux on this torus is taken to be $m=N-1$, while the area scales like
1/N, keeping $\Lambda_{QCD}$ fixed. With a few assumptions, we argue that the
speed of high frequency light in pure non-commutative QED is modified in the

$\theta$ is the non-commutative parameter. If charged flavours are included,
there is an upper bound on the momentum of a photon propagating in the

an exotic theory of open strings.

some simple cases in which the scatterers are optically anisotropic.
Specifically we consider cases in which the spherical particles include
radially and uniformly anisotropic layers. We find that in both cases the
T-matrix theory can be formulated using a modified T-matrix ansatz with
suitably defined modes. In a uniformly anisotropic medium we derive these modes
by relating the wave packet representation and expansions of electromagnetic
field over spherical harmonics. The resulting wave functions are deformed
spherical harmonics that represent solutions of the Maxwell equations. We use
these modes to express the equations for the T-matrix elements in terms of
computationally tractable coefficient functions.

  computations for radially and uniformly anisotropic droplets","14 pages, 6 figures, uses RevTex4","shorten version is published in Phys. Rev. E 65, 056609 (2001)",,,"physics.optics cond-mat",,"  This is the second paper in a series on light scattering from optically
anisotropic scatterers embedded in an isotropic medium. The apparently complex
T-matrix theory involving mixing of angular momentum components turns out to be
an efficient approach to calculating scattering in these systems. We present
preliminary results of numerical calculations of the scattering by spherical
droplets in some simple cases. The droplets contain optically anisotropic
material with local radial or uniform anisotropy. We concentrate on cases in
which the scattering is due only to the local optical anisotropy within the
scatterer. For radial anisotropy we find non-monotonic dependence of the
scattering cross-section on the degree of anisotropy can occur in a regime for
which both the Rayleigh and semi-classical theories are inapplicable. For
uniform anisotropy the cross-section is strongly dependent on the angle between
the incident light and the optical axis, and for larger droplets this
dependence is non-monotonic.

used to give observational meaning to counterfactual reasoning in quantum
physics. A weak measurement is predicted to assign a negative unit population
to a specific state in an interferometric Gedankenexperiment proposed by Hardy.
We propose an experimental implementation with trapped ions of the
Gedankenexperiment and of the weak measurement. In our standard quantum
mechanical analysis of the proposal no states have negative population, but we
identify the registration of a negative population by particles being displaced
on average in the direction opposite to a force acting upon them.

Nimtz and coworkers use the notion of signal velocity in a different sense from

Einstein causality in its ordinary sense. We also show that under quite general
assumptions instantaneous spreading of particle localization occurs in quantum
theory, relativistic or not, with fields or without. We discuss if this affects
Einstein causality.
