to explain the relatively strong H-alpha emission from the Magellanic Stream,
and the O VI absorption seen by FUSE in HVCs and the MS, which require a second
source of ionization (likely collisional). Regardless of mechanism, the fact
that HVCs are detectable in H-alpha indicates they are not far away enough to
be Local Group objects. Adopting the HVC distances from the model, there appear
to be two classes of HVCs: H-alpha-bright clouds with low velocity deviations
from Galactic rotation, and often strong [N II], which are presumably
affiliated with the Galactic disk; and H-alpha-faint clouds with high velocity
deviations, which are likely to be infalling gas.

occultation features in its counting rate when a gamma ray point source crosses

gamma rays along the line of sight. In an uncollimated detector, these
occultation features can be used to locate and monitor astrophysical sources
provided their signals can be individually separated from the detector
background. We show that the Earth occultation technique applied to the Burst
and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory
(CGRO) is a viable and flexible all-sky monitor in the low energy gamma ray and
hard X-ray energy range (20 keV - 1 MeV). The method is an alternative to more
sophisticated photon imaging devices for astronomy, and can serve well as a
cost-effective science capability for monitoring the high energy sky.
  Here we describe the Earth occultation technique for locating new sources and
for measuring source intensity and spectra without the use of complex
background models. Examples of transform imaging, step searches, spectra, and
light curves are presented. Systematic uncertainties due to source confusion,
detector response, and contamination from rapid background fluctuations are
discussed and analyzed for their effect on intensity measurements. A sky
location-dependent average systematic error is derived as a function of
galactic coordinates. The sensitivity of the technique is derived as a function
of incident photon energy and also as a function of angle between the source
and the normal to the detector entrance window. Occultations of the Crab Nebula
by the Moon are used to calibrate Earth occultation flux measurements
independent of possible atmospheric scattering effects.

mass fraction, Y_P. In deriving abundances from observations, the correction
for unseen neutral helium or hydrogen is usually assumed to be absent; i.e.,
the ionization correction factor is taken to be unity (icf = 1). In a previous
paper (VGS), we revisited the question of the icf, confirming a ""reverse""
ionization correction: icf < 1. In VGS the icf was calculated using more nearly
realistic models of inhomogeneous HII regions, suggesting that the published
values of Y_P needed to be reduced by an amount of order 0.003. As star
clusters age, their stellar spectra evolve and so, too, will their icfs. Here
the evolution of the icf is studied, along with that of two, alternate,
measures of the ""hardness"" of the radiation spectrum. The differences between
the icf for radiation-bounded and matter-bounded models are also explored,
along with the effect on the icf of the He/H ratio (since He and H compete for
some of the same ionizing photons). Particular attention is paid to the amount
of doubly-ionized helium predicted, leading us to suggest that observations of,
or bounds to, He++ may help to discriminate among models of HII regions ionized
by starbursts of different ages and spectra. We apply our analysis to the
Izotov & Thuan (IT) data set utilizing the radiation softness parameter, the
[OIII]/[OI] ratio, and the presence or absence of He++ to find 0.95 < icf <

Entropy-Temperature relation. However, the X-ray emission alone cannot
discriminate between different mechanisms and sources of heating. There are no
answers at present to the following questions: how much non-gravitational
energy per baryons is present in the ICM? When was this energy injected? Which
are the sources of heating? The embarrassment in front of these questions is
amplified by the fact that the most viable sources of heating, SNae and stellar
winds, seem to be inefficient in bringing the ICM to the observed entropy

by the Carretta & Gratton metallicity scale, makes age a much more plausible
second parameter candidate for this pair than is the case when a lower
metallicity ([Fe/H] ~ -1.5), closer to the Zinn & West scale, is adopted.
However, while the different HB morphology of these two clusters can be
reproduced by canonical HB models with [Fe/H] ~ -1.2 and an age difference of 2
Gyr, this explanation is not without difficulty. In particular, we confirm
previous suggestions that canonical models are unable to reproduce the detailed
HB morphology of NGC 288 at its red end, for as yet unknown reasons. Finally,
we show that the mass dispersion on the HB of NGC 362 is substantially larger
than for NGC 288, and suggest that there is a correlation between the mass
dispersion on the HB phase and the central density of globular clusters. This
is presumably related to the way environmental effects affect RGB mass loss.

detected in the outer regions, but the rotation curve of this galaxy appears to
drop beyond one effective radius. Assuming an isotropic velocity distribution,
the velocity dispersion profile is consistent with no dark matter within three
effective radii of the nucleus (however, some dark matter can be present if the

However, until now there has not been any well-tested efficient method to
incorporate turbulence into solar modeling. We present here two methods to
include turbulence in solar modeling within the framework of the mixing length
theory, using the turbulent velocity obtained from numerical simulations of the
highly superadiabatic layer of the sun at three stages of its evolution. The
first approach is to include the turbulent pressure alone, and the second is to
include both the turbulent pressure and the turbulent kinetic energy. The
latter is achieved by introducing two variables: the turbulent kinetic energy
per unit mass, and the effective ratio of specific heats due to the turbulent
perturbation. These are treated as additions to the standard thermodynamic
coordinates (e.g. pressure and temperature). We investigate the effects of both
treatments of turbulence on the structure variables, the adiabatic sound speed,
the structure of the highly superadiabatic layer, and the p-mode frequencies.
We find that the second method reproduces the SAL structure obtained in 3D
simulations, and produces a p-mode frequency correction an order of magnitude
better than the first method.

galaxies. The data were taken as part of the HI Jodrell All Sky Survey
(HIJASS). The survey reveals several new aspects to the complex morphology of
the HI distribution in the group. All four of the known dwarf irregular (dIrr)
galaxies close to M81 can be unambiguously seen in the HIJASS data. Each forms
part of the complex tidal structure in the area. We suggest that at least three
of these galaxies may have formed recently from the tidal debris in which they
are embedded. The structure connecting M81 to NGC2976 is revealed as a single
tidal bridge of mass approx. 2.1 x 10^8 Msol and projected spatial extent
approx. 80 kpc. Two `spurs' of HI projecting from the M81 complex to lower
declinations are traced over a considerably larger spatial and velocity extent
than by previous surveys. The dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies BK5N and Kar 64
lie at the spatial extremity of one of these features and appear to be
associated with it. We suggest that these may be the remnants of dIrrs which
has been stripped of gas and transmuted into dEs by close gravitational
encounters with NGC3077. The nucleated dE galaxy Kar 61 is unambiguously
detected in HI for the first time and has an HI mass of approx.10^8 Msol,
further confirming it as a dE/dIrr transitional object. HIJASS has revealed one
new possible group member, HIJASS J1021+6842. This object contains approx. 2 x

  The galaxies were originally selected to have properties similar to Fornax
cluster dE galaxies. As dE galaxies are generally gas poor it is not surprising
that there were only 26 secure detections. All of the detected galaxies have
very high values of $(M_{H}/L_{B})_{\odot}$. Thus the HI selection of faint
optical sources leads to the detection of predominately gas rich galaxies. The
gas rich galaxies tend to reside on the outskirts of the large scale structure
delineated by optically selected galaxies, but they do appear to be associated
with it. These objects appear to have similar relative dark matter content to
optically selected galaxies. The HI column densities are lower than the
'critical density' necessary for sustainable star formation and they appear,
relatively, rather isolated from companion galaxies. These two factors may
explain their high relative gas content. We have considered the HI mass
function by looking at the distribution of velocities of HI detections in
random spectra on the sky.
  The inferred HI mass function is steep though confirmation of this results
awaits a detailed study of the noise characteristics of the HI survey.

expected on the basis of current models for the secular evolution of
interacting binaries, though they have not been detected yet. Their formation
depends on the quantity of matter accreted by the neutron star which, in turn,
is limited by the mechanism of mass ejection from the binary. An efficient mass
ejection can avoid the formation of ultra-fast pulsars or their accretion
induced collapse to a black hole. We propose that significant reductions of the
mass-transfer rate may cause the switch-on of a radio pulsar phase, whose
radiation pressure may be capable of ejecting out of the system most of the
matter transferred by the companion. This can prevent, for long orbital periods
and if a sufficiently fast spin has been reached, any further accretion, even
if the original transfer rate is restored, thus limiting the minimum spin
period attainable by the neutron star. We show that close systems (orbital
periods P_orb \sim 1 hr are the only possible hosts for ultra-fast spinning
neutron stars. This could explain why ultra-fast radio pulsars have not been
detected so far, as the detection of pulsars with very short spin periods in
close systems is hampered, in current radio surveys, by strong Doppler
modulation and computational limitations.

z=0.98), and one is at unknown z. After accounting for observational
efficiencies and uncertainties (statistical and systematic) we derive the rate

R=0.20(+0.84)(-0.19) SNu in clusters at z=0.18 to 0.37, and
R=0.41(+1.23)(-0.39) SNu in clusters at z=0.83 to 1.27 (95 per cent confidence

two redshift bins, the SN rate at a mean redshift of z=0.41 is R(z=0.41) =
0.30(+0.58)(-0.28) SNu. The upper bounds argue against SNe-Ia being the
dominant source of the large iron mass observed in the intra-cluster medium. We
also compare our observed counts of field SNe (i.e., non-cluster SNe of all

with I814 < 26 mag, and 1 to 3 SNe with I814 < 27 mag. These counts are about
two times lower than some of the predictions. Since the counts at these
magnitudes are likely dominated by type-II SNe, our observations may suggest
obscuration of distant SNe-II, or a SN-II luminosity distribution devoid of a

Puppis (O4 If) and zeta Ori (O9.5 I), the broad, blue-shifted line profiles,

produced throughout the wind via instability-driven wind shocks. For some less
luminous OB stars, like theta^1 Ori C (O7 V) and tau Sco (B0 V), the line
profiles are symmetric and narrower. The presence of time-variable emission and
very high-temperature lines in theta^1 Ori C and tau Sco suggest that
magnetically confined wind shocks may be at work. The grating spectrum of the
classical T-Tauri star TW Hya is remarkable because the forbidden-line emission
of He-like Ne IX and O VII is very weak, implying that the X-ray emitting
region is very dense, n = 6E+12 cgs, or that the X-rays are produced very close
to the ultraviolet hotspot at the base of an accretion funnel. ACIS light
curves and spectra of flares and low-mass and high-mass young stellar objects

general property of many very young stars.

Nucleosynthesis calculations based on stellar AGB models are performed assuming

neutron flux resulting from the 13C(alpha,n)16O reaction leads to an efficient

continuum photons per second, equivalent to the presence of about 100 O stars,
but it is completely obscured in optical wavelengths by intervening
interstellar dust. The center holds a ``cluster'' of about 30 O stars, each
within an individual UCHII region emitting free-free emission at cm
wavelengths. Our deep K-band (2.2 um) image toward the W49A cluster reveals
just two of the individual exciting stars, each associated with a point--like
radio source, but the rest are invisible. These O stars are so recently born as
to not yet have emerged from their natal dust cocoons, in contrast to other
Galactic clusters embedded in GH II regions in which many of the individual
massive stars are already revealed. Plausibility arguments are made which
suggest that a stellar disc might be common during the entire UCH II phase of
massive star birth, as it persists after accretion ceases in some stars.
Nebular emission (e.g., from Br gamma) is visible around the periphery of the
central region of W49A, along with candidate exciting stars. Star formation
there may have preceeded that in the center, or its lower density environment
may have speeded up the dispersal of the natal dust cocoons. The W49A cluster

weakly coupled one-dimensional XY systems. At higher wavevectors the collective

differences in details of the equations (due to the fact that here

ultrametric solution are not restricted to the interval $[0,1]$, but are

behaviour of the general solutions for the homogeneous model of Bianchi type
VII in the vacuum case. I conclude that the Bianchi-VII$_0$ model shows an
isotropic expansion and that its only physical solution is equivalent to a
Friedman-Robertson-Walker spacetime whose evolution can, depending on the value
of the JBD coupling constant, begin in a singularity and, after expanding
(inflating, if $\omega>0$), shrink to another, or starting in a non-singular
state, collapse to a singularity. I also conclude that the general
Bianchi-VII$_h$ (with $h\neq 0$) models show strong curvature singularities
producing a complete collapse of the homogeinity surfaces to 2D-manifolds, to
1D-manifolds or to single points. Our analysis depends crucially on the
introduction of the so-called intrinsic time, $\Phi$, as the product of the JBD
scalar field $\phi$ times a mean scale factor $a^3=a_1a_2a_3$, in which the
finite-cosmological-time evolution of this universe unfolds into an infinite
$\Phi$-range. These universes isotropize from an anisotropic initial state,
thence I conclude that they are stable against anisotropic perturbations.

Based on arguments taken from a certain generalized one dimensional
supersymmetric quantum mechanics, which underlies the spectral theory of these

the resolvent was incomplete. We offer here a critique of our asymptotic
argument.

two-dimensional fluid flow producing chaotic mixing, we directly measure the
time-dependent stretching and compression fields. These quantities, previously
available only numerically, attain local maxima along lines coinciding with the
stable and unstable manifolds, thus revealing the dynamical structures that
control mixing. Contours or level sets of a passive impurity field are found to
be aligned parallel to the lines of large compression (unstable manifolds) at

of precision was reached in a measurement of the hyperfine dependence of atomic

paper, we present the details of the first calculation of these anapole moments
in the framework commonly used in other studies of hadronic PNC, a meson
exchange potential that includes long-range pion exchange and enough degrees of
freedom to describe the five independent $S-P$ amplitudes induced by
short-range interactions. The resulting contributions of pi-, rho-, and
omega-exchange to the single-nucleon anapole moment, to parity admixtures in
the nuclear ground state, and to PNC exchange currents are evaluated, using
configuration-mixed shell-model wave functions. The experimental anapole moment
constraints on the PNC meson-nucleon coupling constants are derived and
compared with those from other tests of the hadronic weak interaction. While
the bounds obtained from the anapole moment results are consistent with the
broad ``reasonable ranges'' defined by theory, they are not in good agreement
with the constraints from the other experiments. We explore possible
explanations for the discrepancy and comment on the potential importance of new
experiments.
