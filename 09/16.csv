about a factor of 2.5 brighter than usual, with a 0.5-10 keV (1-24 A)
luminosity of 1.6x10^37 erg/s (at a distance of 2.5 kpc). The spectrum of the
source shows prominent absorption edges, some of which have complicated
substructure. We use the most recent results from laboratory measurements and
and calculations to model the observed substructure of the edges. From the
model, we derive a total absorption column of 6.21+/-0.22 10^21 cm^-2.
Furthermore, the results indicate that there are ~ 10 - 25% abundance
variations relative to solar values for neon, oxygen and iron. The X-ray
continuuum is described well by a two-component model that is often adopted for
black hole candidates: a soft multicolor disk component (with kT = 203 eV) and
a hard power law component (with a photon index of ~2). Comparing the fit
results to those of the hard and soft states, we conclude that the source was
in a transitional state. Finally, the spectrum also shows the presence of faint
emission lines which could be attributed to highly ionized species.

narrowly escape after being subjected to extreme tidal distortion, spin-up,
mixing and mass-loss, which may affect their evolution and appearance. We show
that it is likely that a significant fraction of the stars around massive BHs
in galactic centers have undergone such extreme tidal interactions and survived
subsequent total disruption, either by being deflected off their orbit or by
missing the BH due to its Brownian motion. We discuss possible long-term
observable consequences of this process, which may be relevant for
understanding the nature of stars in galactic centers, and may provide a
signature of the existence of massive BHs there.

numerically simulated. Calculation is made for a region including the compact
star and the gas-supplying companion. The equation of state is that of an ideal
gas characterized by the specific heat ratio $\gamma$. Two cases with $\gamma$
of 1.01 and 1.2 are studied. Our calculations show that the gas, flowing from
the companion via a Lagrangian L1 point towards the accretion disk, forms a
fine gas beam (L1 stream), which penetrates into the disk. No hot spot
therefore forms in these calculations. Another fact discovered is that the gas
rotating with the disk forms, on collision with the L1 stream, a bow shock
wave, which may be called an L1 shock. The disk becomes hot because the L1
shock heats the disk gas in the outer parts of the disk, so that the spiral
shocks wind loosely even with $\gamma=1.01$. The L1 shock enhances the
non-axisymmetry of the density distribution in the disk, and therefore the
angular momentum transfer by the tidal torque works more effectively. The
maximum of the effective $\alpha$ becomes $\sim 0.3$. The 'hot spot' is not
formed in our simulations, but our results suggest the formation of the 'hot
line', which is the L1 shock elongated along the penetrating L1 stream.

expectations and earlier results we found significant differences between the
spatial distributions of low (LMXB) and high (HMXB) mass X-ray binaries. The
volume density of LMXB sources peaks strongly at the Galactic Bulge. HMXBs tend
to avoid the inner 3-4 kpc of the Galaxy, HMXBs are more concentrated towards
the Galactic Plane and show clear signatures of the spiral structure in their
spatial distribution. LMXB sources have a flatter Log(N)-Log(S) distribution
and luminosity function than HMXBs. The integrated 2-10 keV luminosities of
X-ray binaries, averaged over 1996--2000, are 2-3 * 10^39 (LMXB) and 2-3 *
10^38 (HMXB) erg/s. Normalised to the stellar mass and the star formation rate,
respectively, these correspond to 5 * 10^28 erg/s/M_sol for LMXBs and 5 * 10^37
erg/s/(M_sol/yr) for HMXBs. Due to the shallow slopes of the luminosity
functions the integrated emission of X-ray binaries is dominated by the 5-10
most luminous sources which determine the appearance of the Milky Way in the
standard X-ray band for an outside observer. In particular variability of
individual sources or an outburst of a bright transient source can increase the
integrated luminosity of the Milky Way by as much as a factor of ~2. Although
the average LMXB luminosity function shows a break near the Eddington
luminosity for a 1.4 M_sol neutron star, at least 11 sources showed episodes of
super-Eddington luminosity during ASM observations. We provide the maps of
distribution of X-ray binaries in the Milky Way in various projections, which

accurate results can be achieved with modest resources. We present the most
accurate ground state energy (with no small parameter) ever published for
polaron problems, 21 digits for the one-dimensional (1D) polaron at
intermediate coupling. The dimensionality effects on polaron band dispersion,
effective mass, and electron-phonon (el-ph) correlation functions are
investigated in all coupling regimes. It is found that the crossover to large
effective mass of the higher-dimensional polaron is much sharper than the 1D
polaron. The correlation length between the electron and phonons decreases
significantly as the dimension increases. Our results compare favorably with
those of quantum Monte Carlo, dynamical mean-field theory, density-matrix
renormalization group, and the Toyozawa variational method. We demonstrate that
the Toyozawa wavefunction is qualitatively correct for the ground state energy
and the 2-point electron-phonon correlation functions, but fails for the
3-point functions. Based on this finding, we propose an improved Toyozawa
variational wavefunction.

the characteristic QED size of the interaction region to $ R_{e} < 1.17 \times

Compton wavelength of the fundamental particles. This constraint is used to
estimate a lower limit on the size of a fundamental particle related to
gravitational interaction, applying the model of self-gravitating particle-like
