to distinguish between these options. Here we report the transverse motion (in

10^{10}h^{-1}\Msun. The brightest LBGs (Mv<-23) at z=3 merge into
clusters/groups of galaxies at z=0, as suggested from clustering studies of
LBGs. Roughly one half of the galaxies with -23<Mv<-22 at z=3 fall into
groups/clusters, and the other half become typical L* galaxies at z=0 with
stellar mass of ~10^{11}\Msun. Descendants of LBGs at the present epoch have
formed roughly 30% of their stellar mass by z=3, and the half of their current
stellar population is 10 Gyr old, favoring the scenario that LBGs are the
precursors of the present day spheroids. We find that the most luminous LBGs
have experienced a starburst within 500 Myr prior to z=3, but also have formed
stars continuously over a period of 1 Gyr prior to z=3 when all the star
formation in progenitors is coadded. We also study the evolution of the mean

and Gold argued that the universe is in a stable, self-perpetuating equilibrium
state. This concept generalizes the usual cosmological principle to the perfect

  New physics is proposed based on the concept that the universe is a pure wave
system. Based on the new physics and assuming a static universe, processes are
derived for the Hubble redshift and the cosmic background radiation field.
  Then, following the scientific method, I test deductions of the static
universe hypothesis using precise observational data primarily from the Hubble
Space Telescope. Applying four different global tests of the space-time metric,
I find that the observational data consistently fits the static universe model.
The observational data also show that the average absolute magnitudes and
physical radii of first-rank elliptical galaxies have not changed over the last
5 to 15 billion years.
  Because the static universe hypothesis is a logical deduction from the

10^-15 erg cm-2 s-1 (Baldi & Molendi these proceedings, Baldi et al. 2001). The
survey good sensitivity over a large area allows us to confirm and extend
previous Chandra results about a population of X-ray luminous but optically
dull galaxies emerging at 2-10 keV fluxes of about 10-14 erg cm-2 s-1. Although
the statistics are still rather poor, it appears that at these X-ray fluxes the
fraction of these galaxies is similar or even higher than that of narrow line
AGN.

be able to deduce not only the Galaxy's current structure, but also much of its

are made up of components, and of how these formed. The database can be fully
exploited only by fitting to it a sophisticated model of the entire Galaxy.
Steady-state models are of fundamental importance even though the Galaxy cannot
be in a steady state. A very elaborate model of the Galaxy will be required to
reproduce the great wealth of detail that GAIA will reveal. A systematic
approach to model-building will be required if such a model is to be
successfully constructed, however. The natural strategy is to proceed through a
series of models of ever increasing elaborateness, and to be guided in the
specification of the next model by mismatches between the data and the current
model.
  An approach to the dynamics of systems with steady gravitational potentials
that we call the `torus programme' promises to provide an appropriate framework
within which to carry out the proposed modelling programme. The basic
principles of this approach have been worked out in some detail and are
summarized here. Some extensions will be required before the GAIA database can
be successfully confronted. Other modelling techniques that might be employed

emergence of minorities and majorities of agents making opposite decisions and
investigate their spatial organization. We find that dependent on two essential
parameters describing the local impact and the spatial dissemination of
information, either a definite stable minority/majority relation
(single-attractor regime) or a broad range of possible values (multi-attractor
regime) occurs. In the latter case, the outcome of the decision process becomes
rather diverse and hard to predict, both with respect to the share of the
majority and their spatial distribution. We further investigate how a
dissemination of information on different time scales affects the outcome of
the decision process. We find that a more ``efficient'' information exchange
within a subpopulation provides a suitable way to stabilize their majority

Autocorrelation coefficient of the changes has an anti-correlation, and
autocorrelation coefficient of squared changes (volatility correlation
function) has a long time correlation. A probability density function of
intervals between successive trading follows a geometric distribution. GARCH
type stochastic process is theoretically derived from this market model in a

Internet will remain disproportionately in English and will, over time, cause
more people to learn English as second language and thus solidify the role of
English as a global language. This outcome will prevail even though there are
more native Chinese and Spanish speakers than there are native English
speakers. (B) As the Internet matures, it will more accurately reflect the
native languages spoken around the world (perhaps weighted by purchasing power)
and will not promote English as a global language.
  English's ""early lead"" on the web is more likely to persist if those who are
not native English speakers frequently access the large number of English
language web sites that are currently available. In that case, many existing
web sites will have little incentive to develop non-English versions of their
sites, and new sites will tend to gravitate towards English. The key empirical
question, therefore, is whether individuals whose native language is not
English use the Web, or certain types of Web sites, less than do native English
speakers. In order to examine this issue empirically, we employ a unique data
set on Internet use at the individual level in Canada from Media Metrix. Canada
provides an ideal setting to examine this issue because English is one of the
two official languages.
  Our preliminary results suggest that English web sites are not a barrier to
Internet use for French-speaking Quebecois. These preliminary results are
consistent with the scenario in which the Internet will promote English as a
global language.

orbits are computed using an approximate method which we propose in this paper.
In the first step of this method, we prepare general relativistic irrotational
binary neutron stars in a quasiequilibrium circular orbit, neglecting
gravitational waves. We adopt the so-called conformal flatness approximation
for a three-metric to obtain the quasiequilibrium states in this paper. In the
second step, we compute gravitational waves, solving linear perturbation
equations in the background spacetime of the quasiequilibrium states. Comparing
numerical results with post Newtonian waveforms and luminosity of gravitational
waves from two point masses in circular orbits, we demonstrate that this method
can produce accurate waveforms and luminosity of gravitational waves. It is
shown that the effects of tidal deformation of neutron stars and strong general
relativistic gravity modify the post Newtonian results for compact binary
neutron stars in close orbits. We indicate that the magnitude of a systematic
error in quasiequilibrium states associated with the conformal flatness
approximation is fairly large for close and compact binary neutron stars.
Several formulations for improving the accuracy of quasiequilibrium states are
proposed.

analyzing the sensitivity of different observables to the magnitude of the

of the so-called effective W approximation, where the virtual $W$ is treated as
a parton. We take this opportunity to critically assess the validity of this

completed by us of the same process. We comment on several issues related to
top polarization since the observables relevant to distinguish between left and
right effective couplings involve the measurement of the spin of the top. The
conclusion is that the effective $W$ approximation is not well suited for this
subtle analysis; it fails to reproduce the detailed $p_T$ distributions and
grossly distorts the polarization of the emerging top. It does however,
reproduce the overall angular distribution and gives a sensible
order-of-magnitude estimate for the total cross section analysis.

general conifold. The 4-dimensional gravity on D3-branes is reproduced due to
the 4-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert term induced at the quantum level. The
orientifold 3-plane plays a crucial role, in particular, without it the
D3-brane world-volume theories would be conformal due to the tadpole
cancellation. We point out that in some cases the 4-dimensional Planck scale is
controlled by the size of certain relevant (as opposed to marginal) orbifold
blow-ups. We can then have a scenario with the desirable 4-dimensional Planck
scale, the string scale of order TeV, and the cross-over to 10-dimensional
gravity around the present Hubble size. We discuss some general features as
well as concrete models in this ``Orientiworld'' framework, including those
with D7-branes. We point out that the D7-brane gauge symmetry at the quantum
level becomes part of the 4-dimensional gauge symmetry. We present an N=1
supersymmetric model with 3 chiral generations of quarks and leptons, where the
original gauge group (which contains an SU(6) subgroup) can be Higgsed to
obtain a Pati-Salam model with 3 chiral generations, the Pati-Salam Higgs
fields required to break the gauge group further to that of the Standard Model,

gravity and domains of the Planck size. Meanwhile it can be usefully applied to
problems where gravitation effects are negligible and domains of less exotic
size. The essence of this principle is that any physical system can be taken to
be either classical, placed in a D+1-dimensional spacetime, or
quantum-mechanical, located in its D-dimensional boundary. For example, one
believes that a hydrogen atom is a typical quantum system living in a
four-dimensional spacetime, but it can also be conceived as a classical system
living in a five-dimensional embracing spacetime. The subnuclear realm is more
intricate since the gluon vacuum reveals two phases, the hadronic and plasma
phases. They differ in energetics and symmetry. Moreover, the classical
four-dimensional picture is pertinent to the behavior of constituent quarks
while the plasma phase is expected to be grasped by standard four-dimensional
QCD. The relation between the holographic standpoint and the symmetry treatment
of these two phases is outlined. Exact retarded solutions to the classical

two based spaces K and X. If K is a fixed finite complex, Greg Arone has
recently given an explicit model for the Goodwillie tower of the functor
sending a space X to the suspension spectrum \Sigma^\infty Map_T(K,X). Applying
a generalized homology theory h_* to this tower yields a spectral sequence, and
this will converge strongly to h_*(Map_T(K,X)) under suitable conditions, e.g.
if h_* is connective and X is at least dim K connected. Even when the
convergence is more problematic, it appears the spectral sequence can still
shed considerable light on h_*(Map_T(K,X)). Similar comments hold when a
cohomology theory is applied. In this paper we study how various important
natural constructions on mapping spaces induce extra structure on the towers.
This leads to useful interesting additional structure in the associated
spectral sequences. For example, the diagonal on Map_T(K,X) induces a
`diagonal' on the associated tower. After applying any cohomology theory with
products h^*, the resulting spectral sequence is then a spectral sequence of
differential graded algebras. The product on the E_\infty -term corresponds to
the cup product in h^*(Map_T(K,X)) in the usual way, and the product on the
E_1-term is described in terms of group theoretic transfers. We use explicit
equivariant S-duality maps to show that, when K is the sphere S^n, our
constructions at the fiber level have descriptions in terms of the

symmetric contact process on a homogeneous tree T_{2d} of degree 2d > 2: For
parameter values in a certain connected region of positive Lebesgue measure,
the population survives forever with positive probability but ultimately
vacates every finite subset of the tree with probability one. In this phase,
infection trails must converge to the geometric boundary \Omega of the tree.
The random subset \Lambda of the boundary consisting of all ends of the tree in
which the infection survives, called the limit set of the process, is shown to
have Hausdorff dimension no larger than one half the Hausdorff dimension of the
entire geometric boundary. In addition, there is strict inequality at the
transition between weak and strong survival except when the contact process is
isotropic. It is further shown that in all cases there is a distinguished
probability measure \mu, supported by \Omega, such that the Hausdorff dimension
of \Lambda \cap \Omega_{\mu}, where \Omega_{\mu} is the set of \mu-generic
points of \Omega, converges to one half the Hausdorff dimension of \Omega_{\mu}
at the phase separation points. Exact formulae for the Hausdorff dimensions of
\Lambda and \Lambda \cap \Omega_{\mu} are obtained. We also prove that the
contact process at the transition between extinction and weak survival does not
survive. The method developed shows that the contact process at the phase
transition to strong survival survives weakly for d > 1.
