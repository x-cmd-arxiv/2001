BL Lac object 0735+178. The images confirm the presence of a twisted jet with
two sharp apparent bends of 90$^{\circ}$ within two milliarcseconds of the
core, resembling a helix in projection. The observed twisted geometry could be
the result of precession of the jet inlet, but is more likely produced by
pressure gradients in the external medium through which the jet propagates.
Quasi-stationary components are observed at the locations of the 90$^{\circ}$
bends, possibly produced by differential Doppler boosting. Identification of
components across epochs, since the earliest VLBI observations of this source
in 1979.2, proves difficult due to the sometimes large time gaps between
observations. One possible identification suggests the existence of
superluminal components following non--ballistic trajectories with velocities
up to $11.6\pm 0.6 h_{65}^{-1} c$. However, in images obtained after mid-1995,
components show a remarkable tendency to cluster near several jet positions,
suggesting a different scenario in which components have remained nearly
stationary in time at least since mid-1995. Comparison with the earlier
published data, covering more than 19 years of observations, suggests a
striking qualitative change in the jet trajectory sometime between mid-1992 and
mid-1995, with the twisted jet structure with stationary components becoming
apparent only at the later epochs. This would require a re-evaluation of the
physical parameters estimated for 0735+178, such as the observing viewing
angle, the plasma bulk Lorentz factor, and those deduced from these.

different size. The equivalent width of the emission lines dropped by more than
a factor of three between 1999 and 2000; this continues the trend seen in

significant velocity shift.
  We have observed an absorption component to the He I lines on one occasion.
We suggest that, unlike the P Cygni profiles seen in X-ray spectra, this
absorption does not arise in the accelerating zone of a radiatively driven
wind. Instead, the absorption arises in material previously ejected from the

14 times the bulk radius of gyration. Despite the geometric confinement, the
supercooled films exhibit many qualitative features which were also observed in
the bulk and could be analyzed in terms of mode-coupling theory (MCT). Examples
are the two-step relaxation of the incoherent intermediate scattering function,
the time-temperature superposition property of the late time $\alpha$-process
and the space-time factorization of the scattering function on the intermediate

dependence of the LLE with the system size N, for sufficiently high energies,

LLE becomes constant for alpha greater than d whereas it decays as an inverse
power law of N for alpha smaller than d. A recent theoretical calculation based

results (M.-C. Firpo and S. Ruffo, cond-mat/0108158). Here we show that the

homogeneous, Bianchi type III metric with a conformal expansion. The model
respects the evolution of the scale factor predicted by standard cosmology, as
well as the isotropy of the cosmic microwave background. Remarkably, the
introduction of the scalar field, apart from explaining the spacetime
anisotropy, gives rise to an energy density that is close to the critical
density. As a consequence, the model is quasiflat during the entire history of
the universe. Using these results, we are also able to construct approximate
solutions for shear-free cosmological models with rotation. We finally carry

our approximations are acceptably good if the angular velocity of the universe

points. The criterion gives a sufficient condition for instability of the
solution. For a transonic point in collapse, all primary-direction nodal-point
solutions are unstable, while all secondary-direction nodal-point solutions and
saddle-point ones are stable against the kink mode. The situation is reversed
in expansion. Applications are the following: the expanding flat Friedmann
solution for $1/3 \le k < 1$ and the collapsing one for $0< k \le 1/3$ are
unstable; the static self-similar solution is unstable; nonanalytic
self-similar collapse solutions are unstable; the Larson-Penston (attractor)

in hadronic interactions, whenever large partonic transverse momenta are
involved. However, cross sections diverge in the limit p_T -> 0, and the usual
treatment is the definition of a lower cutoff p_T_min, such that processes with
a smaller p_T -- so-called soft processes -- are simply ignored, which is
certainly not correct for example at RHIC energies. A more consistent procedure
amounts to introduce a technical parameter Q_0^2, referred to as soft
virtuality scale, which is nothing but an artificial borderline between soft
and hard physics. We will discuss such a formalism, which coincides with the
improved parton model for high p_T processes and with the phenomenological
treatment of soft scattering, when only small virtualities are involved. The
most important aspect of our approach is that it allows to obtain a smooth
transition between soft and hard scattering, and therefore no artificial
dependence on a cutoff parameter should appear.

expansions according to $f (\mathbf{r} + \mathbf{r}') = \exp (\mathbf{r}' \cdot

addition theorems of irreducible spherical tensors, the application of the
translation operator in its Cartesian form $\exp (x' \partial /\partial x) \exp
(y' \partial /\partial y) \exp (z' \partial /\partial z)$ would lead to
enormous technical problems. A better alternative consists in using a series
expansion for the translation operator $\exp (\mathbf{r}' \cdot
\mathbf{\nabla})$ involving powers of the Laplacian $\mathbf{\nabla}^2$ and
spherical tensor gradient operators $\mathcal{Y}_{\ell}^{m} (\nabla)$, which
are irreducible spherical tensors of ranks zero and $\ell$, respectively [F.D.\
Santos, Nucl. Phys. A {\bf 212}, 341 (1973)]. In this way, it is indeed
possible to derive addition theorems by doing three-dimensional Taylor
expansions [E.J. Weniger, Int. J. Quantum Chem. {\bf 76}, 280 (2000)]. The
application of the translation operator in its spherical form is particularly
simple in the case of $B$ functions and leads to an addition theorem with a
comparatively compact structure. Since other exponentially decaying functions
like Slater-type functions, bound-state hydrogenic eigenfunctions, and other
functions based on generalized Laguerre polynomials can be expressed by simple
finite sums of $B$ functions, the addition theorems for these functions can be
written down immediately.

by using dynamical variables. I suggest to introduce the degree of separability
as a purification parameter, where the purified state has a smaller degree of
separability than the initial one. An improved version of the Oxford protocol
is described, in which local unitary transformations optimize each step.

provides us with minimal information about the field. We study the interaction
of the thermal field and a quantum system composed of two qubits and find that
such a chaotic field with minimal information can nevertheless entangle the
qubits which are prepared initially in a separable state. This simple model of
a quantum register interacting with a noisy environment allows us to understand
how memory of the environment affects the state of a quantum register.
