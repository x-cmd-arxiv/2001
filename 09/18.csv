small given that CMB data alone constrain neither h nor Omega_Lambda
significantly. It is due to the tight (and accidental) correlation, in these

inference combined with a fast method for calculating angular power spectra.

in the universe. To constrain the nature of dark energy in a model-independent
manner, we allow the density of dark energy, $\rho_X(z)$, to be an arbitrary
function of redshift. Using simulated data from a space-based supernova pencil
beam survey, we find that by optimizing the number of parameters used to
parametrize the dimensionless dark energy density,
$f(z)=\rho_X(z)/\rho_X(z=0)$, we can obtain an unbiased estimate of both f(z)
and $\Omega_m$ (assuming a flat universe and that the weak energy condition is
satisfied). A plausible supernova pencil beam survey (with a square degree
field of view and for an observational duration of one year) can yield about
2000 SNe Ia with $0\le z \le 2$. Such a survey in space would yield SN peak
luminosities with a combined intrinsic and observational dispersion of $\sigma
(m_{int})=0.16$ mag. We find that for such an idealized survey, $\Omega_m$ can
be measured to 10% accuracy, and f(z) can be estimated to $\sim$ 20% to $z \sim
1.5$, and $\sim$ 20-40% to $z \sim 2$, depending on the time dependence of the
true dark energy density. Dark energy densities which vary more slowly can be
more accurately measured. For the anticipated SNAP mission, $\Omega_m$ can be
measured to 14% accuracy, and f(z) can be estimated to $\sim$ 20% to $z \sim
1.2$. Our results suggest that SNAP may gain much sensitivity to the
time-dependence of f(z) and $\Omega_m$ by devoting more observational time to
the central pencil beam fields to obtain more SNe Ia at z>1.2. We also find
that Monte Carlo analysis gives a more accurate estimate of the dark energy
density than the maximum likelihood analysis. (abridged)

of azimuthally asymmetric temperature variations along the direction of the
cluster mass elongation. X-ray and weak lensing mass estimates are in good
agreement for the outer parts (r > 200h^{-1}) of the cluster; however, in the
core the observed temperature distribution cannot reconcile the x-ray and
strong lensing mass estimates in any model in which the intracluster gas is in
thermal hydrostatic equilibrium. Our x-ray data are consistent with a scenario
in which recent merger activity in A2218 has produced both significant
non-thermal pressure in the core and substructure along the line of sight; each
of these phenomena probably contributes to the difference between lensing and

mass to 8.7-11.7M_sun (9.6M_sun is the best fit value) and the distance to
7.4--12.3 kpc (Orosz et al. 2001). At this distance the peak flux of 12 Crab in
the 2--12 keV energy band, measured by ASM/RXTE, implies the X-ray luminosity
exceeding 2-3e39 erg/s, i.e. near or above the Eddington limit for a 9.6M_sun
black hole. An optical photometry shows that at the peak of the optical
outburst the visual magnitude increased by Delta m_V > 4.7^m relative to the
quiescent level and reached m_V < 8.8^m. An assumption that this optical
emission is due to irradiated surface of an accretion disk or a companion star
with the the black body shape of the spectrum would mean that the bolometric
luminosity of the system exceeds L>3e41 erg/s > 300 L_Edd.
  We argue that the optical data strongly suggest presence of an extended
envelope surrounding the source which absorbs primary X-rays flux and reemits
it in optical and UV. The data also suggests that this envelope should be
optically thin in UV, EUV and soft X-rays. The observed properties of V4641 Sgr
at the peak of an optical flare are very similar to those of SS433. This
envelope is likely the result of near or super Eddington rate of mass accretion
onto the black hole and it vanishes during subsequent evolution of the source
when apparent luminosity drops well below the Eddington value. Thus this
transient source provides us direct proof of the dramatic change in the
character of an accretion flow at the mass accretion rate near or above the
critical Eddington value as predicted long time ago by the theoretical models.

complete down to at least L* galaxies, the nearest galaxy neighbors range from
100kpc to >10 Mpc. Of these 46 absorbers, 8 are found in galaxy voids. After
correcting for pathlength and sensitivity, we find that 22+-8% of the Lya
absorbers lie in voids, which requires that at least some low-column density
absorbers are not extended halos of individual bright galaxies. The number
density of these clouds yields a baryon fraction of 4.5+-1.5% in voids.
  The stronger Lya absorbers (10^{13.2-15.4} cm^-2) cluster with galaxies more
weakly than galaxies cluster with each other, while the weaker absorbers
(10^{12.4-13.2} cm^-2) are more randomly distributed. The median distance from
a low-z Lya absorber in our sample to its nearest galaxy neighbor (~500 kpc) is
twice the median distance between bright galaxies in the same survey volume.
This makes any purposed ""association"" between these Lya absorbers and
individual galaxies problematic. The suggested correlation between Lya absorber
equivalent width (W) and nearest-galaxy impact parameter does not extend to
W<200mA, or to impact parameters >200kpc. Instead, we find statistical support
for the contention that absorbers align with large-scale filaments of galaxies.
While some strong (W>400mA) Lya absorbers may be gas in the extended gaseous

the wind velocity, the mass of the wind-driving galaxies, the fraction of

observed redshift) all affect wind propagation significantly; other physical
effects can be important but are sub-dominant. We find that under reasonable

assumed that this trend is due to a dust-induced selection bias: DLA systems
with high N(HI) and high metallicity contain so much dust that the background
QSO becomes too dim to be included in optically selected surveys. Here, it is
argued that this explanation may not be viable. Instead, it is proposed that
conversion to molecular hydrogen determines the maximum HI column density.
Molecular hydrogen forms on the surface of dust grains and is destroyed by
photodissociation. Therefore, the molecular fraction correlates with both the
dust content and, because of self-shielding, the total hydrogen column density,
and anticorrelates with the intensity of the incident UV radiation. It is shown
that the first relation can account for the observed anticorrelation between

little or no depletion of Be in stars cooler than 6000 K, in spite of the large
depletions (0.5 - 2.5 dex) in Li. The mean value of A(Be) for the ten coolest
stars is 1.33 +/- 0.06, not far from the meteoritic value of 1.42. The pattern
in the Be abundances - a Be dip in the F stars and undepleted Be in the cool
stars - is well matched by the predictions of slow mixing due to stellar
rotation (e.g. Deliyannis and Pinsonneault). The depletions of Li and Be
probably occur simultaneously. The Li and Be abundances are correlated for
stars in the temperature range of 5850 - 6680 K, similar to results from
earlier work on Li and Be in F and G field stars. The Hyades G dwarfs have more
Be than the sun; their initial Be may have been larger or they may not be old
enough to have depleted Be. For those Hyades stars which appear to have little
or no depletion of Li or Be, the Li/Be ratio is found to be 75 +/- 30.

therefore a combination of multi-object 3D spectrograph with multi-conjugate
adaptive optics in large fields. A partial, but still competitive correction
shall be prefered, over a much wider field of view. This can be done by
estimating the turbulent volume from sets of natural guide stars, by optimizing
the correction to several and discrete small areas of few arcsec2 selected in a
large field (Nasmyth field of 25 arcmin) and by correcting up to the 6th, and
eventually, up to the 60th Zernike modes. Simulations on real extragalactic
fields, show that for most sources (>80%), the recovered resolution could reach
0"".15-0"".25 in the J and H bands. Detection of point-like objects is improved
by factors from 3 to >10, when compared with an instrument without adaptive
correction. The proposed instrument concept, FALCON, is equiped with deployable

been shown to be a site of cosmic ray (CR) electron acceleration to TeV
energies (Muraishi et al. 2000). Here we present evidence that this remnant is
also accelerating CR nuclei. Such nuclei can interact with ambient interstellar
gas to produce high energy gamma-rays via the decay of neutral pions. We
associate the unidentified EGRET GeV gamma- ray source 3EG J1714-3857 with a
massive (~3*10 5 Mo) and dense (~500 nucleons cm -3) molecular cloud
interacting with RX J1713.7-3946. Direct evidence for such interaction is
provided by observations of the lowest two rotational transitions of CO in the
cloud; as in other clear cases of interaction, the CO(J=2-1)/CO(J=1-0) ratio is
significantly enhanced. Since the cloud is of low radio and X-ray brightness,
CR electrons cannot be responsible for the bulk of its GeV emission there. A
picture thus emerges where both electrons and nuclei are being accelerated by
the SNR: whereas the CR electrons dominate the local non-thermal radio, X-ray
and TeV emission, the shock accelerated CR protons and ions (hadrons) are
revealed through their interactions in the adjacent massive cloud. Such a
scenario had been anticipated by Aharonian, Drury and Volk (1994).

represent the unique ground state; sequences associated with such structures
possess both robustness to mutation and thermodynamic stability. Here we report
that highly designable backbone conformations also emerge in a realistic

the self-avoiding walk. At each iteration a pivot which produces a global
change in the walk is proposed. If the resulting walk is self-avoiding, the new
walk is accepted; otherwise, it is rejected. Past implementations of the
algorithm required a time O(N) per accepted pivot, where N is the number of
steps in the walk. We show how to implement the algorithm so that the time
required per accepted pivot is O(N^q) with q<1. We estimate that q is less than
0.57 in two dimensions, and less than 0.85 in three dimensions. Corrections to
the O(N^q) make an accurate estimate of q impossible. They also imply that the
asymptotic behavior of O(N^q) cannot be seen for walk lengths which can be
simulated. In simulations the effective q is around 0.7 in two dimensions and
0.9 in three dimensions. Comparisons with simulations that use the standard
implementation of the pivot algorithm using a hash table indicate that our
implementation is faster by as much as a factor of 80 in two dimensions and as
much as a factor of 7 in three dimensions. Our method does not require the use
of a hash table and should also be applicable to the pivot algorithm for
off-lattice models.

aftershock (ETAS) model for aftershocks, which describes foreshocks,
aftershocks and mainshocks on the same footing. The occurrence rate of
aftershocks triggered by a single mainshock decreases with the time from the
mainshock according to the modified Omori law K/(t+c)^p with p=1+theta. A
mainshock at time t=0 triggers aftershocks according to the local Omori law,
that in turn trigger their own aftershocks and so on. The effective branching
parameter n, defined as the mean aftershock number triggered per event,
controls the transition between a sub-critical regime n<1 to a super-critical
regime n>1. In the sub-critical regime, we recover and document the crossover
from an Omori exponent 1-theta for t<t* to 1+theta for t<t* found previously in
[Sornette and Sornette, 1999a] for a special case of the ETAS model. In the
super-critical regime n>1 and theta>0, we find a novel transition from an Omori
decay law with exponent 1-theta fot t<t* to an explosive exponential increase
of the seismicity rate fot t>t*. The case theta<0 yields an infinite n-value.
In this case, we find another characteristic time tau controlling the crossover
from an Omori law with exponent 1-theta for t<tau, similar to the local law, to
an exponential increase at large times. These results can rationalize many of
the stylized facts reported for aftershock and foreshock sequences, such as (i)
the suggestion that a small p-value may be a precursor of a large earthquake,
(ii) the relative seismic quiescence sometimes observed before large
aftershocks, (iii) the positive correlation between b and p-values, (iv) the
observation that great earthquakes are sometimes preceded by a decrease of
b-value and (v) the acceleration of the seismicity preceding great earthquakes.

enables the assignment of unique, mnemonic identifiers to Internet hosts and
the consistent mapping of these names to IP addresses. The root of the domain
name system is the top of the hierarchy and is currently managed by a
quasi-private centralized regulatory authority, the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). This paper identifies and discusses the
economic and policy issues raised by competing DNS roots. The paper provides a
precise definition of root-competition and shows that multiple roots are a
species of standards competition, in which network externalities play a major
role. The paper performs a structural analysis of the different forms that
competing DNS roots can take and their effects on end-user compatibility. It
then explores the policy implications of the various forms of competition.
  The thesis of the paper is that root competition is caused by a severe
disjunction between the demand for and supply of top-level domain names. ICANN
has authorized a tiny number of new top-level domains (7) and subjected their
operators to excruciatingly slow and expensive contractual negotiations. The
growth of alternate DNS roots is an attempt to bypass that bottleneck. The
paper arrives at the policy conclusion that competition among DNS roots should
be permitted and is a healthy outlet for inefficiency or abuses of power by the
dominant root administrator.

understandings of international political economy, this paper offers an
explanation and analysis of the shifting patterns of regulation which have been
evident in the telecommunications sector in recent years. It aims to illustrate
explain and explore the implications of the movement of regulatory sovereignty
away from the nation-state, through regional conduits, to global organisations
in the crystallisation of a world system of telecommunications governance.
  Our central argument is that telecommunications governance has evolved from a
regulatory arena characterised, in large part, by national diversity, to one
wherein a more convergent global multilayered system is emerging. We suggest
that the epicentre of this regulatory system is the relatively new World Trade
Organisation (WTO). Working in concert with the WTO are existing
well-established nodes regulation. In further complement, we see regional
regulatory projects, notably the European Union (EU), as important conduits and
nodes of regulation in the consolidation of a global regulatory regime.
  By way of procedure, we first explore the utility of a neo-Gramscian approach
for understanding the development of global regulatory frameworks. Second, we
survey something of the recent history - and, in extension, conventional wisdom
- of telecommunications regulation at national and regional levels. Third, we
demonstrate how a multilayered system of global telecommunications regulation
has emerged centred around the regulatory authority of the WTO. Finally, we
offer our concluding comments.

studied analytically, asymptotically and numerically starting from the exact
finite dimensional classical reduced Hamiltonian recently derived by
H\'aj{\'\i}\v{c}ek and Kucha\v{r}. The formulation of the quantum mechanics
encounters two problems. The first is the multivalued nature of the Hamiltonian
and the second is the construction of an appropriate self adjoint momentum
operator in the space of the shell motion which is confined to a half line. The
first problem is solved by identifying and neglecting orbits of small action in
order to obtain a single valued Hamiltonian. The second problem is solved by
introducing an appropriate lapse function. The resulting quantum mechanics is
then studied by means of analytical and numerical techniques. We find that the
region of total collapse has very small probability. We also find that the
solution concentrates around the classical Schwarzschild radius. The present
work obtains from first principles a quantum mechanics for the shell and
provides numerical solutions, whose behavior is explained by a detailed WKB
analysis for a wide class of collapsing shells.

  For this resummation and its renormalization we use formulations developed

the minimal mixing pattern, according to which the whole of this mixing is
basically determined by the physical mass generation for the first family of
fermions. So, in the chiral symmetry limit when the masses of the lightest ($u$
and $d$) quarks vanish, all the quark mixing angles vanish. This minimal
pattern is shown to fit extremely well the already established CKM matrix
elements and to give fairly distinctive predictions for the as yet poorly known
ones. Remarkably, together with generically small quark mixing, it also leads
to large neutrino mixing, provided that neutrino masses appear through the
ordinary ``see-saw'' mechanism. It is natural to think that this minimal
flavour mixing pattern presupposes some underlying family symmetry, treating
families of quarks and leptons in a special way. Indeed, we have found a local
chiral $SU(3)_{F}$ family symmetry model which leads, through its dominant
symmetry breaking vacuum configuration, to a natural realization of the
proposed minimal mechanism. It can also naturally generate the quark and lepton
mass hierarchies. Furthermore spontaneous CP violation is possible, leading to
a maximal CP violating phase $\delta =\frac{\pi}{2}$, in the framework of the
MSSM extended by a high-scale $SU(3)_{F}$ chiral family symmetry.

necessitates the existence of an additional U(1)_Z' symmetry, which is of
non-GUT origin and remains unbroken down to intermediate, or low, energies.
Realistic string models frequently give rise to non-GUT U(1) symmetries, which
arise from the flavor symmetries in the models. In this paper we demonstrate in
a string-inspired toy model that such a stringy Z' can indeed guarantee proton
longevity and viable phenomenology in the neutrino sector, as well as in the
quark and charged lepton sectors.

disturbances that are localized to distances smaller than $\sqrt{\theta}$,

preferred. We find that there is a minimal horizon radius, below which the

debated meson-baryon scalar sector with strangeness -1. We deduce the general
structure of the amplitudes close to the d K^+\bar{K}^0 threshold, allowing for
primary K^+ \bar{K^0} as well as \pi^+\eta production with the two mesons in
relative S- or P-wave. The interactions of the mesons are accounted for by
using chiral unitary techniques, which generate dynamically the a_0(980)

formulae are derived that allow to incorporate the final state interactions in
these systems for any model of the production mechanism. We illustrate this
approach by considering two specific production mechanisms based on three
flavor meson-baryon chiral perturbation theory. It is demonstrated that in this
scenario the \bar{K^0}d interactions are very important and can change the
cross section by as much as one order of magnitude. The amount of \pi^+\eta
versus K^+ \bar{K^0} production is shown to depend critically on the primary
mixture of the two mechanisms, with large interference effects due to final

distributions of invariant masses which are drastically modified by the final

to the bending of the particle's trajectory, which follows the shape of the
channel. The parameters of this undulator, which totally define the spectrum
and the angular distribution of the radiation (both spontaneous and
stimulated), depend on the type of the crystal and the crystallographic plane
(axis), on the type of a projectile and its energy, and on the shape of the
bent channel, and, thus, can be varied significantly by varying these
characteristics.
  As an example, we consider the acoustically induced radiation (AIR) which is
generated by ultra-relativistic particles channeled in a crystal which is bent
by a transverse acoustic wave. The AIR mechanism allows to make the undulator
with the main parameters varying in wide ranges, which are inaccessible in the
undulators based on the motion of particles in the periodic magnetic fields and
also in the field of the laser radiation. The intensity of AIR can be easily
made larger than the intensity of the radiation in a linear crystal and can be
varied in a wide range by varying the frequency and the amplitude of the
acoustic wave in the crystal. A possibility to generate stimulated emission of
high-energy photons (in keV - MeV region) is also discussed.

an ultra-relativistic charged particle channeling along a crystal plane which
is periodically bent by a transverse acoustic wave. In such a system there are
two essential mechanisms leading to the photon emission. The first one is the
ordinary channeling radiation. This radiation is generated as a result of the
transverse oscillatory motion of the particle in the channel. The second one is
the acoustically induced radiation. This radiation is emitted because of the
periodic bending of the particle's trajectory created by the acoustic wave. The
general formalism described in our work is applicable for the calculation of
the total radiative losses accounting for the contributions of both radiation
mechanisms. We analyze the relative importance of the two mechanisms at various
amplitudes and lengths of the acoustic wave and the energy of the projectile
particle. We establish the ranges of projectile particle energies, in which
total energy loss is small for the LiH, C, Si, Ge, Fe and W crystals. This
result is important for the determination of the projectile particle energy
region, in which acoustically induced radiation of the undulator type and also
the stimulated photon emission can be effectively generated. The latter effects
have been described in our previous works.

periodically bent. The bending might be due either to the propagation of a
transverse acoustic wave through the crystal, or due to the static strain as it
occurs in superlattices. In either case the periodically bent crystal serves as
an undulator which allows to generate X-ray and gamma-radiation.
  We propose the scheme for accurate quantitative treatment of the radiation in
presence of the dechanneling. The scheme includes (i) the analytic expression
for spectral-angular distribution which contains, as a parameter, the
dechanneling length, (ii) the simulation procedure of the dechanneling process
of a positron in periodically bent crystals. Using these we calculate the

undulator radiation generated by an ultra-relativistic positron channelling
along a crystal plane, which is periodically bent. The bending might be due
either to the propagation of a transverse acoustic wave through the crystal, or
due to the static strain as it occurs in superlattices. The periodically bent
crystal serves as an undulator. We investigate the dependence of the
intensities of both the ordinary channelling and the undulator radiations on
the parameters of the periodically bent channel with simultaneous account for
the dechannelling effect of the positrons. We demonstrate that there is a range
of parameters in which the undulator radiation dominates over the channelling
one and the characteristic frequencies of both types of radiation are well
separated. This result is important, because the undulator radiation can be
used to create a tunable source of X-ray and gamma-radiation.
