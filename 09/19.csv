and caustics in its halo. The recently discovered ring of stars near
galactocentric distance 20 kpc and a series of sharp rises in the Milky Way
rotation curve are interpreted as due to the presence of caustic rings of dark
matter in the galactic plane. Their locations are consistent at the 3% level
with the predictions of the self-similar infall model for the caustic ring
radii. Also, a triangular feature in the IRAS map of the galactic plane is
consistent with the imprint of a caustic ring of dark matter upon the baryonic
matter. These observations imply that the dark matter in our neighborhood is
dominated by a single flow whose density and velocity vector are estimated.

change both the kinetic energy release and the amount of $^{56}$Ni synthesized
in the supernova outburst. Both effects are related to a change in the
Chandrasekhar mass $M_{Ch} \propto G^{-3/2}$. In addition, the integrated
variation of $G$ with time would also affect the cosmic evolution and therefore
the luminosity distance relation. We show that the later effect in the
magnitudes of Type Ia supernovae is typically several times smaller than the
change produced by the corresponding variation of the Chandrasekhar mass. We
investigate in a consistent way how a varying $G$ could modify the Hubble
diagram of Type Ia supernovae and how these results can be used to set upper
bounds to a hypothetical variation of $G$. We find $G/G_0 \la 1.1$ and $G'/G
\la 10^{-11} yr^{-1}$ at redshifts $z\simeq 0.5$. These new bounds extend the

of the interstellar medium. Most studies on the development of the instability
so far have been based on an initial equilibrium system with a uniform magnetic
field. However, the Galactic magnetic field possesses a random component in
addition to the mean uniform component, with comparable strength of the two
components. Parker and Jokipii have recently suggested that the random
component can suppress the growth of small wavelength perturbations. Here, we
extend their analysis by including gas pressure which was ignored in their
work, and study the stabilizing effect of the random component in the
interstellar gas with finite pressure. Following Parker and Jokipii, the
magnetic field is modeled as a mean azimuthal component, $B(z)$, plus a random
radial component, $\epsilon(z) B(z)$, where $\epsilon(z)$ is a random function
of height from the equatorial plane. We show that for the observationally
suggested values of $<\epsilon^2>^{1/2}$, the tension due to the random
component becomes important, so that the growth of the instability is either
significantly reduced or completely suppressed. When the instability still
works, the radial wavenumber of the most unstable mode is found to be zero.
That is, the instability is reduced to be effectively two-dimensional. We
discuss briefly the implications of our finding.

irradiation on the geometrical shape of the secondary in a close binary
containing a compact star, the source of the radiation, and a normal companion
star, where we include the possibility of shadowing by an accretion disc. The
model is based on a simple modification of the standard Roche binary potential
in which the radiation-pressure force is parameterised using the ratio of the
radiation to the gravitational force. We have constructed numerical solutions
of approximate 3-dimensional irradiated equipotential surfaces to demonstrate
the main geometrical effects of external radiation pressure. For systems in
which the inner Lagrangian point is irradiated directly and for sufficiently
high irradiation fluxes, the critical condition for which the secondary fills
its tidal lobe changes from an inner to an outer critical configuration, where
the critical equipotential surface connects to one of the outer rather than the
inner Lagrangian point. Such a situation may apply to evaporating binary pulsar
systems (e.g. PSR 1957+20), stars orbiting supermassive black holes in AGN and
some high-mass X-ray binaries (including Centaurus X-3). For systems containing
an accretion disc, which shadows the inner Lagrangian point from the external
irradiation, the presence of significant radiation pressure causes a
non-axisymmetric deformation of the stellar surface. We have calculated
modified Roche potentials to determine the main effects on the optical
lightcurves and radial velocity curves for typical binary parameters. Compared
to previous studies, the inclusion of irradiation-pressure effects results in
changes in the derived system parameters (e.g. component masses, radial
velocities) that may be as high as 30 per cent.

no such thing as the entropy of a system, that there are many entropies, and
that the choice between treating particles as being distinguishable or not

essentially pedagogical; we add to their analysis by examining the paradox from

does it provide the right connection between different entropies but, in

  Prague, Czech Republic, June 2001",,,,"cs.PL",,"  Nomadic applications create replicas of shared objects that evolve
independently while they are disconnected. When reconnecting, the system has to
reconcile the divergent replicas. In the log-based approach to reconciliation,
such as in the IceCube system, the input is a common initial state and logs of
actions that were performed on each replica. The output is a consistent global
schedule that maximises the number of accepted actions. The reconciler merges
the logs according to the schedule, and replays the operations in the merged
log against the initial state, yielding to a reconciled common final state.
  In this paper, we show the NP-completeness of the log-based reconciliation
problem and present two programs for solving it. Firstly, a constraint logic
program (CLP) that uses integer constraints for expressing precedence
constraints, boolean constraints for expressing dependencies between actions,
and some heuristics for guiding the search. Secondly, a stochastic local search
method with Tabu heuristic (LS), that computes solutions in an incremental
fashion but does not prove optimality. One difficulty in the LS modeling lies
in the handling of both boolean variables and integer variables, and in the
handling of the objective function which differs from a max-CSP problem.
Preliminary evaluation results indicate better performance for the CLP program
which, on somewhat realistic benchmarks, finds nearly optimal solutions up to a
thousands of actions and proves optimality up to a hundreds of actions.

knowledge based methods have been developed. However their applicability is
often unsuccessful due to their low efficiency. One of the reasons for this is
that (parts of the) problems have to be solved again and again, instead of
being ""learnt"" from preceding processes. However, learning processes bring with
them the problem of conservatism, for in technical domains innovation is a
deciding factor in competition. On the other hand a certain amount of
conservatism is often desired since uncontrolled innovation as a rule is also
detrimental. This paper proposes the heuristic RKF (Relevant Knowledge First)
for making decisions in configuration processes based on the so-called
relevance of objects in a knowledge base. The underlying relevance-function has
two components, one based on reinforcement learning and the other based on
forgetting (fading). Relevance of an object increases with its successful use
and decreases with age when it is not used. RKF has been developed to speed up

"cs/0109035","Rob Frieden","Rob Frieden","Revenge of the Bell Heads: How the Net Heads Lost Control of the
  Internet",,,,,"cs.CY",,"  A dichotomy in regulatory treatment and corporate cultures exists between
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and telecommunication carriers. Telephone
company executives (Bell Heads) may resent regulation, but they accept their
fate and work creatively to exploit anomalies and opportunities to secure a
regulation-conferred competitive advantage. Most ISP executives (Net Heads)
appear to embrace a libertarian attitude, strongly opposing any government
involvement. Despite the clash of cultures, the telecommunications and Internet
worlds have merged. Such convergence jeopardizes the ability of Net Heads to
avoid some degree of regulation, particularly when they offer services
functionally equivalent to what their Bell Head counterparts offer.
  This paper will assess the regulatory consequences when telecommunication and
Internet services converge in the marketplace and in terms of operating
technologies. The paper identifies commercial developments in the Internet to
support the view that the Internet has become more hierarchical and more like
telecommunication networks. The paper concludes that telecommunication carriers
will display superior skill in working the regulatory process to their
advantage. The paper suggests that Bell Heads will outmaneuver Net Heads
particularly when the revenue siphoning effect of Internet-mediated services
offsets the revenues generated from ISP leases of telecommunication
transmission capacity.

introduced by Einstein in 1907, and used by him to construct his theory of

assuming that the only long-range field with gravitational-strength couplings
to matter is a massless spin-2 field. Modern unification theories, and notably
String Theory, suggest the existence of new fields (in particular, scalar
fields: ``dilaton'' and ``moduli'') with gravitational-strength couplings. In
most cases the couplings of these new fields ``violate'' the EP. If the field
is long-ranged, these EP violations lead to many observable consequences
(variation of ``constants'', non-universality of free fall, relative drift of
atomic clocks,...). The best experimental probe of a possible violation of the
EP is to compare the free-fall acceleration of different materials.

the tedious process of combining and rearranging the perturbation variables in
a clever way that the system can be cast into a set of hyperbolic first order

equations remain quite lengthy, and we therefore rederive the perturbation
equations in a different gauge, which has been first proposed by Battiston et
al. (1970). Using the ADM formalism, one is immediately lead to a first order
hyperbolic evolution system, which is remarkably simple and can be numerically
integrated without many further manipulations. Moreover, the symmetry between

two neutrino mode of the double beta decay in some other nuclei, including
160Gd. Experimental limits for the double beta decay of 160Gd have been
reported . Recently it was argued that the strong cancellation of the 2nu mode
in the double beta decay of 160Gd would suppress the background for the
detection of the 0nu mode.
  In the present contribution we extend the previous research evaluating the
double beta half lives of 160Gd using the pseudo SU(3) model. While the 2nu
mode is forbidden when the most probable occupations are considered, states
with different occupation numbers can be mixed through the pairing interaction.
The amount of this mixing is evaluated using perturbation theory. The
possibility of observing the double beta decay in 160Gd is discussed for both
the 2nu and 0nu modes.

solved exactly, i.e., with correct asymptotic boundary conditions for the
continuous spectrum. The calculations are preformed with effective Skyrme
interactions. The exact HFB solutions are compared with HFB calculations based
on box boundary conditions and with resonant continuum Hartree-Fock-BCS
(HF-BCS) results. The comparison is done for the neutron-rich Ni isotopes. It
is shown that close to the drip line the amount of pairing correlations depends
on how the continuum coupling is treated. On the other hand, the resonant
continuum HF-BCS results are generally close to those of HFB even in
neutron-rich nuclei.

interesting source for high energy photons and is worth to be studied

the metric tensor are used as the fictitious degrees of freedom for the cell,
thus avoiding the problem of spurious cell rotations and artificial symmetry
breaking effects present in the original Parrinello-Rahman scheme. This is
complemented by the Nose-Poincare approach for isothermal sampling. The
combination of these two approaches leads to equations of motion that are
Hamiltonian in structure, and which can therefore be solved numerically using
recently developed powerful symplectic integrators. One such integrator, the
generalised leap-frog, is employed to provide a numerical algorithm for
integrating the isothermal-isobaric equations of motion obtained.

but rather are constructed as the eigenvectors of suitably defined annihilation
operators. We describe as well the Segal-Bargmann representation for the
system, the associated unitary Segal-Bargmann transform, and a natural
inversion formula. Although many of these results are in principle special
cases of the results of B. Hall and M. Stenzel, we give here a substantially
different description based on ideas of T. Thiemann and of K. Kowalski and J.

Conditions on time optimal simulation are formulated in terms of spectral
majorization of matrices characterizing the coupling parameters. Moreover, we
consider a specific system of n harmonic oscillators with bilinear interaction.
In this case, decoupling can efficiently be achieved using the combinatorial
concept of difference schemes. For this type of interactions we present optimal
schemes for inversion.
