Both Fugazza et al. (2000) and Borissova et al. (2000) questioned this
classification, because they were able to detect the star on images obtained in
previous years. In infrared frames taken on Oct. 15, 1998, the Nova 1999 has
(J-K) = 1.14 and K = 14.69 mag. Our light curve study, based primarily on 92
unfiltered Lick images, suggested that the object could be a Mira-type variable
with a period of 640.7 days. This period is very close to that obtained by
Fugazza et al. (2000) - 631 days. The star is overluminous with respect to the
period-luminosity (PL) relation derived by Feast et al. (1989) for Mira
variables in the LMC. At longer periods (P > 400 ~ days), many LMC Miras show
such behavior and the PL relation appears to break down. It is possible that
the situation in IC1613 is similar. An optical spectrum obtained with the
Keck-II telescope shows features typical of M3Ie or M3IIIe stars. We conclude
that the star is a normal long-period M-type Mira variable, the first such star
confirmed in IC1613.

accompanied the formation of the black-hole primary. Here we systematically
investigate the implications of these observations for the black-hole formation
process. Using a variety of supernova models, including both standard as well
as hypernova models (for different helium-star masses, explosion energies, and
explosion geometries) and a simple model for the evolution of the binary and
the pollution of the secondary, we show that most of the observed abundance
anomalies can be explained for a large range of model parameters (apart from
the abundance of Ti). The best models are obtained for He star masses of 10 to
16 Msun, where spherical hypernova models are generally favoured over standard
supernova ones. Aspherical hypernova models also produce acceptable fits,
provided there is extensive lateral mixing. All models require substantial
fallback and that the fallback material either reached the orbit of the
secondary or was mixed efficiently with material that escaped. The black hole
therefore formed in a two-step process, where the initial mass of the collapsed
remnant was increased substantially by matter that fell back after the initial
collapse. This may help to explain the high observed space velocity of Nova Sco
either because of a neutrino-induced kick (if a neutron star was formed first)
or by asymmetric mass ejection in an asymmetric supernova explosion.

in and around its nucleus, and NGC 4579 has a dominant nuclear point source
embedded in a very extended, diffuse nebulosity. From their multi- wavelength

weak, compact starburst, whose X-ray emission is due to gas heated by stellar
winds and supernovae, NGC 4736 is in a recent or aging starburst phase, where
the X-ray emission is dominated by a dense cluster of X-ray binaries, and NGC
4579 is powered by accretion onto a supermassive black hole. We detect 39
discrete sources in NGC 4736 and 21 in NGC 4579, most with L_X > 10^37 erg/s.
One source in the disk of NGC 4579 could be an ultraluminous X-ray binary with
L_X (2-10 keV) = 9x10^39 erg/s, but it could also be a background quasar. The
most luminous discrete sources have simple power-law spectra, which along with
their luminosities suggest that these are X-ray binaries accreting near or
above the Eddington rate for a neutron star. By comparing the luminosity
functions of discrete X-ray sources in these and other galaxies we find a
potential connection between the age of the stellar population and the slope of
the cumulative X-ray source luminosity function: galaxies with primarily old
stellar populations have steeper luminosity functions than starburst galaxies.
We suggest that this difference results from the contribution of high-mass
X-ray binaries from the young stellar population to the upper end of the
luminosity function.

lines, (b) the equivalent widths of the absorption lines and (c) the spectral
energy distributions (SED). Several scenarios of star formation have been
considered. The observed properties in the main body can be reproduced by a
continuous star formation process which started not earlier than 100 Myr ago,
if a small extinction is assumed. However, the observations can be reproduced
equally well by a stellar population forming continuously since 10 Gyr ago, if
the star formation rate has increased during the last 100 Myr in the main body
of SBS 0940+544 by at least a factor of five. In summary, we find no compelling
evidence which favors either a young or an old age of SBS 0940+544.

Hydrogen H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines are detected in the spectra of I

Keck II spectra of different regions in I Zw 18C reveal H$\gamma$, H$\delta$

constrain the age of the stellar population in I Zw 18C. Ages derived from two
different methods, one based on the equivalent widths of the H$\alpha$,
H$\beta$ emission lines and the other on H$\gamma$, H$\delta$ absorption lines
are consistent with a 15 Myr instantaneous burst model. We find that a small
extinction in the range $A_V$ = 0.20 -- 0.65 mag is needed to fit the observed
spectral energy distribution of I Zw 18C with that model. In the case of
constant star formation, all observed properties are consistent with stars
forming continuously between ~ 10 Myr and < 100 Myr ago. We use all available
observational constraints for I Zw 18C, including those obtained from Hubble

zero-spacing problems, the interferometric data were combined with single-dish
measurements obtained with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope. The observed
magnetic field structure in NGC 3627 suggests that two field components are
superposed. One component smoothly fills the interarm space and shows up also
in the outermost disk regions, the other component follows a symmetric S-shaped
structure. In the western disk the latter component is well aligned with an
optical dust lane, following a bend which is possibly caused by external
interactions. However, in the SE disk the magnetic field crosses a heavy dust
lane segment, apparently being insensitive to strong density-wave effects. We
suggest that the magnetic field is decoupled from the gas by high turbulent
diffusion, in agreement with the large \ion{H}{i} line width in this region. We
discuss in detail the possible influence of compression effects and
non-axisymmetric gas flows on the general magnetic field asymmetries in NGC

distinguishable particle species makes this a highly nontrivial task. I first
describe qualitatively some of the novel features of polydisperse phase
behaviour, and outline a theoretical framework within which they can be
explored. Current techniques for predicting polydisperse phase equilibria are
then reviewed. I also discuss applications to some simple model systems
including homopolymers and random copolymers, spherical colloids and
colloid-polymer mixtures, and liquid crystals formed from rod- and plate-like
colloidal particles; the results surveyed give an idea of the rich
phenomenology of polydisperse phase behaviour. Extensions to the study of

in the microcanonical and in the canonical ensemble. We avoid the divergence of
the gravitational potential at short distances by considering the case of
self-gravitating fermions and hard spheres models. Three kinds of phase
transitions (of zeroth, first and second order) are evidenced. They separate a
``gaseous'' phase with a smoothly varying distribution of matter from a
``condensed'' phase with a core-halo structure. We propose a simple analytical
model to describe these phase transitions. We determine the value of energy (in
the microcanonical ensemble) and temperature (in the canonical ensemble) at the
transition point and we study their dependance with the degeneracy parameter
(for fermions) or with the size of the particles (for a hard spheres gas).
Scaling laws are obtained analytically in the asymptotic limit of a small short
distance cut-off. Our analytical model captures the essential physics of the
problem and compares remarkably well with the full numerical solutions.

there is one bistable region where the system can exist in either a reactive

Diffusion between two facets is shown to induce complex multistability in the

facets. We explore the role of enhanced fluctuations in the proximity of a cusp
bifurcation point associated with one facet in producing transitions between

hard-scattering formalism in terms of quark-diquark degrees of freedom. This
reformulation provides the exact form of photon- and gluon-diquark vertices and
corresponding vertex functions (diquark form factors) in the limit of
asymptotically large momentum transfers -- and thus also asymptotic constraints
which should be fulfilled by phenomenological quark-diquark models for hard
scattering. As an application of this reformulation we present an analysis of
the hard electromagnetic nucleon form factors with respect to their
quark-diquark content.

reviewed and a new approach called the Minimal Flavour Mixing (MFM) is
considered in detail. According to MFM the whole of the flavour mixing is
basically determined by the physical mass generation of the first family of
fermions. So, in the chiral symmetry limit when the masses of the lightest
quarks, u and d, vanish, all the weak mixing angle vanish. This minimal pattern
is shown to fit extremely well the already established CKM matrix elements and
to give fairly distinctive predictions for the as yet poorly known ones.
Remarkably, together with generically small quark mixing it also leads to the
large neutrino mixing thus giving adequate solution to the solar and
athmospheric neutrino oscillation problem. The possible origin of this approach
in the MSSM extended by the high-scale $SU(3)_{F}$ chiral family symmetry is
discussed.

versions. Here, we propose a scheme to implement the quantum random walk on a
line and on a circle in an ion trap quantum computer. With current ion trap
technology, the number of steps that could be experimentally implemented will
be relatively small. However, we show how the enhanced features of these walks
could be observed experimentally. In the limit of strong decoherence, the
quantum random walk tends to the classical random walk. By measuring the degree
to which the walk remains `quantum', this algorithm could serve as an important
benchmarking protocol for ion trap quantum computers.

leads to a mapping from qubits to parafermions: particles with a hybrid
boson-fermion quantum statistics. We study this mapping in detail, and use it
to provide a classification of the algebras of operators acting on qubits.
These algebras in turn classify the universality of different classes of
physically relevant qubit-qubit interaction Hamiltonians. The mapping is
further used to elucidate the connections between qubits, bosons, and fermions.
These connections allow us to share universality results between the different
particle types. Finally, we use the mapping to study the quantum computational
power of certain anisotropic exchange Hamiltonians. In particular, we prove
that the XY model with nearest-neighbor interactions only is not
computationally universal. We also generalize previous results about universal
quantum computation with encoded qubits to codes with higher rates.
