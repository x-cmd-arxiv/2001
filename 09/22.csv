with cluster temperature as expected from cosmological simulations. Contrary to
previous observational suggestions, we find a mild but robust increase of M/L
from poor (T = 1 - 2 keV) to rich (T = 12 keV) clusters; over this range, the
mean M/L_V increases by a factor of about 2. The best fit relation satisfies
M/L_V = (170 +- 30) T(keV)^(0.3 +- 0.1) h at z=0, with a large scatter. This
trend confirms predictions from cosmological simulations which show that the
richest clusters are antibiased, with a higher ratio of mass per unit light
than average. The antibias increases with cluster temperature. The effect is
caused by the relatively older age of the high-density clusters, where light
has declined more significantly than average since their earlier formation
time. Combining the current observations with simulations, we find a global
value of M/L_V = 240 +- 50 h, and a corresponding mass density of the universe
of Omega_m = 0.17 +- 0.05.

1821+643 and its surrounding hot cluster observed with the Chandra High Energy
Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS). An iron emission line attributed to
the quasar at ~6.43 keV (rest frame) is clearly resolved, with an equivalent
width of ~100 eV. Although we cannot rule out contributions to the line from a
putative torus, the diskline model provides an acceptable fit to this iron
line. We also detect a weak emission feature at ~6.9 keV (rest frame). We
suggest that both lines could originate in an accretion disk comprised of a
highly ionized optically thin atmosphere sitting atop a mostly neutral disk. We
search for absorption features from a warm/hot component of the intergalactic
medium along the ~1.5Gpc/h line of sight to the quasar. No absorption features
are detected at or above the 3 sigma level while a total of six OVI intervening
absorption systems have been detected with HST and FUSE. Based on the lack of
OVII and OVIII absorption lines and by assuming collisionally ionization, we
constrain the gas temperature of a typical OVI absorber to 10^5 < T < 10^6 K,
which is consistent with the results from hydrodynamic simulations of the
intergalactic medium. The zeroth order image reveals the extended emission from
the surrounding cluster. We have been able to separate the moderate CCD X-ray
spectrum of the surrounding cluster from the central quasar and find that this
is a hot cluster with a temperature of ~10 keV and a metal abundance of ~0.3
Zo. We also independently obtain the redshift of the cluster, which is
consistent with the optical results. We estimate that the cluster makes
negligible contributions to the 6.9 keV iron K line flux.

Ly-alpha forest data. We also calculate how warm dark matter (WDM) would modify
these predicted densities by delaying halo formation and imposing phase space
constraints. As a measure of central density, we adopt the quantity D_{V/2},
the density within the radius R_{V/2} at which the halo rotation curve falls to
half of its maximum value, in units of the critical density. We compare the
theoretical predictions to values of D_{V/2} estimated from the rotation curves
of dark matter dominated disk galaxies. Assuming that dark halos are described
by NFW profiles, our results suggest that the conventional LCDM model predicts
excessively high dark matter densities, unless there is some selection bias in
the data toward the low-concentration tail of the halo distribution. A WDM
model with particle mass 0.5-1 keV provides a better match to the observational
data. However, the modified cold dark matter model, TLCDM, fits the data
equally well, suggesting that the solution to the ``halo cores'' problem might
lie in moderate changes to cosmological parameters rather than radical changes
to the properties of dark matter. If CDM halos have the steeper density
profiles found by Moore et al., then neither conventional LCDM nor TLCDM can
reproduce the observed central densities.

regulations, Internet radio stations remain largely unregulated. As Internet
radio usage has increased certain stakeholders have begun to argue that these
Internet radio broadcasters are providing significant and diverse programming
to American audiences and that government regulation of spectrum-using radio
station ownership may be further relaxed.
  One of the primary justifications for regulation of ownership has been to
protect diversity in broadcasting. This study hypothesizes that Internet radio
broadcasting does add diversity to the radio broadcasting industry and that it
should be considered as relevant by regulators.
  This study evaluates the role of Internet radio broadcasters according to
five criteria intended to gauge the level of diversity being delivered to
listeners online. By measuring the levels of format, channel, ownership,
location and language diversity among Internet radio stations, it is possible
to draw benchmark lessons about the new medium's ability to provide Americans
with diverse broadcasting options.
  The study finds that Internet radio broadcasters are in fact adding
measurable diversity to the radio broadcasting industry. Internet broadcasters
are providing audiences with access to an increasing number of stations,
owners, formats, and language choices, and it is likely that technologies
aiding in the mobility of access as well as broadband evolution will reinforce
these findings.

the linearized hydrodynamical equations. The neutron stars considered in this

white dwarfs. A dynamical bar-mode (m=2) instability is observed when the ratio
of rotational kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy $\beta$ of the
neutron star is greater than the critical value $\beta_d \approx 0.25$. This
bar-mode instability leads to the emission of gravitational radiation that
could be detected by gravitational wave detectors. However, these sources are
unlikely to be detected by LIGO II interferometers if the event rate is less
than $10^{-6}$ per year per galaxy. Nevertheless, if a significant fraction of
the pre-supernova cores are rapidly rotating, there would be a substantial
number of neutron stars produced by the core collapse undergoing bar-mode
instability. This would greatly increase the chance of detecting the
gravitational radiation.

limit is correlated with the shrinking of a two-torus to zero size. We study
some non-perturbative tests of the smoothness hypothesis with respect to Theta
in theories with and without supersymmetry. In the supersymmetric case this is
done by adapting Witten's index to the present situation, and in the
nonsupersymmetric case by studying the dependence of energy levels on the
instanton angle. We find that regularizations which restore supersymmetry at
high energies seem to preserve Theta-smoothness whereas nonsupersymmetric
asymptotically free theories seem to violate it. As a final application we use
Morita duality to study a recent proposal of Susskind to use a noncommutative

Let $g=g_1+...+g_n$ be the decomposition of the Lie algebra $g$ of the

two-photon laser for the Maxwell-Bloch equations. The model assumes pumping to
the upper state of the two-photon transition. We consider the Maxwell-Bloch
equations on the basis of which we study the stability analysis of the steady
state of the system. The system is taken to be contained in a ring-laser
cavity. Asymptotic expansion of the eigenvalue and analytic information are
obtained in some realistic limits, such as very large reflectivity, very small
cavity losses, or very small population relaxation rate. The results are
illustrated with an application to a specific atomic system (Potassium) as an
amplifying medium.
