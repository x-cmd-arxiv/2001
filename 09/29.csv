optical filaments produce strong OVI 1032,1038 emission, which is detected in
all the spectra. The OVI emission is resolved by FUSE into a strong component
centered at 0 km/s, and weaker components centered at +/- 140 km/s. The MDRS
spectra allow us to study the variation of OVI emission in the post-shock
structure. We find that the zero velocity emission is associated directly with
the Balmer filament shock, while the high velocity emission comes from a more
uniformly distributed component elsewhere along the line of sight. We also find
that the shocks producing the emission at +/- 140 km/s have velocities between

increase in Tc is due to contribution to the pairing arising from the
interaction of electrons with the vibrational manifold of the molecule. The
proposed mechanism opens up the possibility to observe a site-selective isotope
effect. We also suggest that intercalating CHI3 would further increase the

the concept of security the set values that ought to guide the shape of
web-browser security. We found it impossible to construct an internally
consistent set of values until we realized that two robust -- and in places
competing -- conceptions of computer security were influencing our thinking. We
needed to pry these apart and make a primary commitment to one. One conception
of computer security invokes the ordinary meaning of security. According to it,
computer security should protect people -- computer users -- against dangers,
harms, and threats. Clearly this ordinary conception of security is already
informing much of the work and rhetoric surrounding computer security. But
another, substantively richer conception, also defines the aims and trajectory
of computer security -- computer security as an element of national security.
Although, like the ordinary conception, this one is also concerned with
protection against threats, its primary subject is the state, not the
individual. The two conceptions suggest divergent system-specifications, not
for all mechanisms but a significant few.

corresponds initially to an isocurvature density perturbation, which generates
the curvature perturbation after inflation when the curvaton density becomes a
significant fraction of the total. The isocurvature density perturbation
disappears if the curvaton completely decays into thermalised radiation. Any
residual isocurvature perturbation is 100% correlated with the curvature. The

potential. Crucial for this effect is a term in the equation of motion which
acts like a negative mass square term, as occurs for tachyonic preheating and
negative coupling particle production. Our techniques apply in models with a
strong coupling between matter fields $\chi$ and the inflaton $\phi$, or in
some models in which the inflaton has a large amplitude of oscillation. Note
that our analysis yields results which are quite model dependent. Exponential
growth occurs in a model with interaction Lagrangian $-g M_{pl}\phi\chi^2$.
However, for the interaction Lagrangian $-g^2\phi^2\chi^2$, our formalism shows
that in the large coupling limit there can only be exponential particle
production when $\phi$ crosses 0.

that Gribov's prescription of cutting off the functional integral at the Gribov
horizon does not change the Schwinger-Dyson equations, but rather resolves an
ambiguity in the solution of these equations. We note that Gribov's
prescription is not exact, and we therefore turn to the method of stochastic
quantization in its time-independent formulation, and recall the proof that it
is correct at the non-perturbative level. The non-perturbative Landau gauge is
derived as a limiting case, and it is found that it yields the Faddeev-Popov
method in Landau gauge with a cut-off at the Gribov horizon, plus a novel term
that corrects for over-counting of Gribov copies inside the Gribov horizon.
Non-perturbative but truncated coupled Schwinger-Dyson equations for the gluon
and ghost propagators $D(k)$ and $G(k)$ in Landau gauge are solved
asymptotically in the infrared region. The infrared critical exponents or
anomalous dimensions, defined by $D(k) \sim 1/(k^2)^{1 + a_D}$ and $G(k) \sim

qubit is physically implemented by a two-dimensional subspace of states of a
mode of the electromagnetic field, specifically, the space spanned by the
vacuum and the one photon state. Our experiment follows along lines suggested
by H. W. Lee and J. Kim, Phys. Rev. A, 63, 012305 (2000) and E.Knill,
R.Laflamme and G.Milburn Nature 409: 46 (2001).

"quant-ph/0110001","Kathryn Flores","K. L. Flores, V. Ramakrishna","Control of Switched Networks via Quantum Methods","15 pages, 5 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We illustrate a technique for specifying piecewise constant controls for
classes of switched electrical networks, typically used in converting power in
a dc-dc converter. This procedure makes use of decompositions of SU(2) to
obtain controls that are piecewise constant and can be constrained to be
bang-bang with values 0 or 1. Complete results are presented for a third order
network first. An example, which shows that the basic strategy is viable for
fourth order circuits, is also given. The former evolves on SO(3), while the
latter evolves on SO(4). Since the former group is intimately related to SU(2)
while the latter is related to SU(2)xSU(2), the methodology of this paper uses
factorizations of SU(2). The systems in this paper are single input systems
with drift. In this paper, no approximations or other artifices are used to
remove the drift. Instead, the drift is important in the determination of the
controls. Periodicity arguments are rarely used.

formulation is presented for performing decoherence-free (DF) quantum computing
in Rigged Liouville Space (RLS). Three types of interactions were considered,
and in each case, stationary and evolutionary states were evaluated for DF
behavior in both the total space and the projected subspace. Projected
subspaces were found using the subdynamics kinetic equation. It was shown that
although the total space may be decoherent, the subspace can be DF. In the
projected subspace, the evolution of the density operator may be time
asymmetric. Hence, a formulation for performing quantum computing in RLS or
rigged Hilbert space (RHS) was proposed, and a quantum Controlled-Not Logical
gate with corresponding operations in RLS (RHS) was constructed. A generalized
quantum Turing machine in RHS was also discussed. Key Words: Quantum Computing,
