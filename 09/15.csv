  to the Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/340584",,"astro-ph",,"  We have generated new, self-consistent spectral and atmosphere models for the
effective temperature range 600 K to 1300 K thought to encompass the known T
dwarfs. For the first time, theoretical models are compared with a {\it family}
of measured T dwarf spectra at wavelengths shortward of $\sim$1.0 micron. By
defining spectral indices and standard colors in the optical and very
near-infrared, we explore the theoretical systematics with \teff, gravity, and
metallicity. We conclude that the short- wavelength range is rich in
diagnostics that complement those in the near-infrared now used for spectral
subtyping. We also conclude that the wings of the Na D and K I (7700\AA)
resonance lines and aggressive rainout of heavy metals (with the resulting
enhancement of the sodium and potassium abundances at altitude) are required to
fit the new data shortward of 1.0 \mic. Furthermore, we find that the water
bands weaken with increasing gravity, that modest decreases in metallicity
enhance the effect in the optical of the sodium and potassium lines, and that
at low \teffs, in a reversal of the normal pattern, optical spectra become
bluer with further decreases in \teff. Moreover, we conclude that T dwarf
subtype is not a function of \teff alone, but that it is a non-trivial function
of gravity and metallicity as well. As do Marley et al. (2001), we see evidence
in early T dwarf atmospheres of a residual effect of clouds. With cloudless
models, we obtain spectral fits to the two late T dwarfs with known parallaxes,
but a residual effect of clouds on the emergent spectra of even late T dwarfs
can not yet be discounted.

1.2% of what it is at 0 C. The low water vapor levels result in exceptionally
low values of sky noise. This is crucial for large-scale observations of faint

functions of the lowest S and P electron and hole states in typical quantum-dot

components of the radial wave functions of an electron in the 8-band model have
amplitudes comparable with the amplitude of the corresponding 2-band-electron
component. This is a consequence of the coupling between the conduction and
valence bands, which gives a strong nonparabolicity of the conduction band. At
the same time, the 2-band-electron component of the radial wave functions of a
hole in the 8-band model is small compared with the amplitudes of the
corresponding 6-band-hole components. It is shown that in the CdS/HgS/CdS/H_2O
QDQW holes in the lowest states are strongly localized in the well region
(HgS). On the contrary, electrons in this QDQW and both electron and holes in
the CdTe/HgTe/CdTe/H_2O QDQW are distributed through the entire dot. The
importance of the developed theory for QDQWs is proven by the fact that in
contrast to our rigorous 8-band model, there appear spurious states within the

determine the spectrum of eigenvalues of the evolution operator. In this
letter, we show that tomography and spectroscopy can be naturally interpreted
as dual forms of quantum computation. We show how to adapt the simplest case of
the well-known phase estimation quantum algorithm to perform both tasks, giving
it a natural interpretation as a simulated scattering experiment. We show how
this algorithm can be used to implement an interesting form of tomography by
performing a direct measurement of the Wigner function of a quantum system. We
present results of such measurements performed on a system of three qubits
using liquid state NMR quantum computation techniques in a sample of
trichloroethylene. Remarkable analogies with other experiments are discussed.
