its ellipsoidal truncation, is able to predict accurately the collapse, in the
orbit-crossing sense, of generic mass elements. Some points that have undergone
orbit crossing are assigned to the network of filaments and sheets that
connects the halos; it is demonstrated that this network resembles closely that
found in N-body simulations. The code generates a catalogue of dark matter
halos with known mass, position, velocity, merging history and angular

compared with the results of large N-body simulations that cover a range of

introducing free parameters. The algorithm requires negligible computer time as

Considering only binaries with mass ratios q>0.1, we find that OB stars in NGC

that about half of the detected binaries have q<0.2, which does not contradict
the assumption that companion masses are randomly drawn from the initial mass
function. There is no evidence in our sample that wide-binary properties depend
upon the mass of the primary star. The high frequency of massive binaries in a
cluster as rich as NGC 6611 and the lack of a strong mass dependence of their
properties are difficult to reconcile with the scenario whereby massive stars
form as the result of mergers of smaller stars. The canonical protostellar
accretion scenario together with cloud fragmentation, on the other hand, can
naturally explain most of the observed binary properties, although the very
high stellar density in the protocluster is likely to require significant

scaling relations. Observed clusters and groups, however, show strong
deviations from these predicted relations. We argue that these deviations are
unlikely to be entirely due to observational biasses; we assume they are
physically based, due to the presence of excess entropy in the intracluster
medium in addition to that generated by accretion shocks during the formation
of the cluster. Several mechanisms have been suggested as a means of generating
this entropy. Focussing on those mechanisms that preheat the gas before it
becomes a constituent of the virialized cluster environment, we present a
simple, intuitive, physically motivated, analytic model that successfully
captures the important physics associated with the accretion of high entropy
gas onto group and cluster-scale systems. We use the model to derive the new
relationships between the observable properties of clusters and groups of
galaxies, as well as the evolution of these relations. These include the
luminosity-temperature and luminosity-$\sigma$ relations, as well as the
temperature distribution function and X-ray luminosity function. These
properties are found to be a more accurate description of the observations than
those predicted from the standard framework. Future observations will that

in which, at least close to the star, the energy transport is dominated by
Poynting flux. The pulsar drives a low-frequency wave in this wind, consisting
of stripes of toroidal magnetic field of alternating polarity, propagating in a
region around the equatorial plane. The current implied by this configuration
falls off more slowly with radius than the number of charged particles
available to carry it, so that the MHD picture must, at some point, fail.
Recently, magnetic reconnection in such a structure has been shown to
accelerate the wind significantly. This reduces the magnetic field in the
comoving frame and, consequently, the required current, enabling the solution
to extend to much larger radius. This scenario is discussed and, for the Crab
Nebula, the range of validity of the MHD solution is compared with the radius
at which the flow appears to terminate. For sufficiently high particle
densities, it is shown that a low frequency entropy wave can propagate out to
the termination point. In this case, the ""termination shock"" itself must be

(Na) and aluminum (Al) during the early epochs of the Galactic halo with the
use of a model that reproduces the observed box-shaped distribution of
extremely metal-poor stars in the [Na, Al/Mg] versus [Mg/H] plane. Our model is
constructed under the assumptions that those stars retain the elemental
abundance patterns produced by individual Type II supernovae (SNe), and that
the yields of the odd elements depend on the initial metallicity, z, of their
SN progenitors. As a result, recent abundance determinations that clarify how
the [Na, Al/Mg] ratios of field stars have evolved to the solar values enable
us to deduce how the yields of these odd elements depend on z. The observed
trends in these abundances, in particular the very large scatter (over 1 dex in
[Al/Mg]) requires that the Al yield scales as m_Al proportional to z^0.6 for
[Mg/H]<-1.8, while the observed [Na/Mg] trend requires that the Na yield scales
as m_Na proportional to z^-0.4 for [Mg/H]<-1.8 and m_Na proportional to z^0.4
for [Mg/H]>-1.8. It is found that the predicted frequency distribution of stars
in the [Na/Mg] versus [Mg/H] diagram is very sensitive to the assumed form of
the primordial IMF, and that its slope is steeper than the Salpeter IMF. The
necessity to match the observed abundance patterns of odd elements and the
frequency distribution of extremely metal-poor stars should provide useful
constraints on nucleosynthesis calculations of metal-free massive stars as well
as on theories of their formation.

(2000; LP00). First, we show that our model - which involves three distinct
emission regimes - can provide excellent fits to the time resolved spectra of
GRBs, and we present these results for a few bursts. We then describe how the
phenomenological Band spectrum (Band et al., 1993) can be interpreted in the
context of our models based on the value of the low energy photon index
$\alpha$. We discuss the types of correlations one would expect to observe
among the Band parameters if these models are correct. We then compare these
predictions to the existing data, combining a sample of 2,026 time resolved
spectra (from approximately 80 bursts). We show that the correlations found in
the data are consistent with the models, and discuss the constraints they place
on the emission physics. In particular, we find a 4-sigma negative correlation
between the peak of the nu-Fnu spectrum, Ep, and the low energy photon index
$\alpha$ for bursts with $-2/3 < \alpha < 0$, in contrast to what is predicted
by the instrumental effect discussed in LP00. We suggest that this correlation
is simply due to the mechanism responsible for producing $\alpha$'s above the
value of -2/3 - namely, a decreasing mean pitch angle of the electrons. We also
show that Ep is correlated with the photon flux, and interpret this as a result
of changing magnetic field or characteristic electron energy between emission
episodes. Finally, we discuss the implications our results have on particle
acceleration in GRBs, and prospects for further testing these models with the
anticipated data from HETE-2, Swift and GLAST.

Wide-field star counts have been performed in two colours on pairs of digitized
ESO and SRC Schmidt plates, allowing us to select likely cluster members in the
colour-magnitude diagrams. Cluster tidal extensions were emphasized using a
wavelet transform. Taking into account observational biases, namely the galaxy
clustering and differential extinction in the Galaxy, we have associated these
stellar overdensities with real open cluster structures stretched by the
galactic gravitational field. As predicted by theory and simulations, and
despite observational limitations, we detected a general elongated (prolate)
shape in a direction parallel to the galactic Plane, combined with tidal tails
extended perpendicularly to it. This geometry is due both to the static
galactic tidal field and the heating up of the stellar system when crossing the
Disk. The time varying tidal field will deeply affect the cluster dynamical
evolution, and we emphasize the importance of adiabatic heating during the
Disk-shocking. In the case of NGC 2548, our dating of the last shocking with
the Plane (based on a tidal clump) is consistent with its velocity. During the
10-20 Z-oscillations experienced by a cluster before its dissolution in the
Galaxy, crossings through the galactic Disk contribute to at least 15% of the
total mass loss. Using recent age estimations published for open clusters, we

instead three distinct components. We use a multi-component bidimensional model
to study in detail these three components that we identify respectively with
the cooling flow region, the galactic and the cluster halo. From these data we
derive a binding mass distribution in agreement with that suggested by optical
dynamical indicators, with an inner core dominated by luminous matter and an
extended dark halo differently distributed on galactic and cluster scales. The
HRI data and a preliminary analysis of Chandra public data, allow us to detect
significant density fluctuations in the halo. We discuss possible
non-equilibrium scenarios to explain the hot halo structure, including tidal
interactions with neighboring galaxies, ram stripping from the intra-cluster
medium and merging events. In the innermost region of NGC 1399, the comparison
between the X-ray and radio emission suggests that the radio emitting plasma is
displacing and producing shocks in the hot X-ray emitting gas. We found that
the NGC 1404 halo is well represented by a single symmetric Beta model and
follows the stellar light profile within the inner 8 kpc. The mass distribution
is similar to the `central' component of the NGC 1399 halo. At larger radii ram
pressure stripping from the intra-cluster medium produces strong asymmetries in
the gas distribution. Finally we discuss the properties of the point source
population finding evidence of correlation between the source excess and NGC
1399.

motion ($\sim1.9$ arcsec/yr). The objects were discovered in a high proper
motion survey in the poorly investigated southern sky region with
$\delta<-60^{\circ}$ using SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey (SSS) data. Both objects,
SSSPM J2231-7514 and SSSPM J2231-7515, show featureless optical spectra. Fits
of black-body models to the spectra yield effective temperatures of 3810 K and
3600 K, respectively for the bright (V=16.60) and faint (V=16.87) component.
Both degenerates are much brighter than other recent discoveries of cool white
dwarfs with comparable effective temperatures and/or $B_J-R$ colours.
Therefore, they should be relatively nearby objects. The comparison with other
cool white dwarfs and a photometric distance determination yield distance
estimates between 9 pc and 14 pc. The latter seems to be more realistic, since
the good agreement of the proper motion of both components within the errors of
about 8 mas/yr and the angular separation between the two stars support a
distance of about 15 pc with relatively small masses of the components. With
smaller distance we should be able to measure a differential proper motion due
to orbital motion if the orbital plane is not strongly inclined and the present
orbital velocity vector is not close to the line of sight. The space velocity
based on that distance and assumptions on radial velocity makes the new pair of
extremely cool white dwarfs some of the probably oldest members of the Galactic
disk population, although the possibility that these objects are part of a
Galactic halo dark matter component can also not yet be ruled out.

transducer characteristics, we also obtained a lower bound (at low temperature,
P_cav > -3.0 bar in helium 3, P_cav > - 10.4 bar in helium 4). In this article
we thus present quantitative evidence that cavitation occurs at low temperature

renormalized hybridization pseudogap scale $T^{*}$, which correlates with the
single-ion Kondo scale, and a lattice Kondo scale $T_{0} < T^{*}$, which acts
as the Fermi-liquid coherence scale. The lattice Kondo resonance is split into
a main branch, which is pinned at the Fermi level, and whose width is set by

persists for all $n_{c}$. On increasing temperature, the lattice Kondo
resonance at the Fermi level vanishes on a temperature scale of order $10

for the consistent treatment of the non-wave function vertex (but rules out the

time-reversal invariance and continuity between valence and non-valence
regimes. We derive our expressions by assuming the effective qq potential is
independent of the mass squared, and verify the sum rule in a non-relativistic
approximation in which the potential is energy independent. We consider
bare-coupling as well as interacting skewed parton distributions and develop
approximations for the Green's function which preserve the general properties

amplitudes.

derived within string theory modify the couplings of KK gravitons and thereby
lead to an exponential fall-off of cross sections in the high-energy limit.
Further, we point out that the assumption of Regge behaviour for a scattering
amplitude in the high energy limit, $T\propto s^{\alpha(t)}$, combined with a
linear growth of the total cross-section, $\sigma_{tot}(s)\propto s$, violates
elastic unitarity. Regge behaviour leads to a stringent bound on the growth of
the total cross-section, $\stot (s) \leq 32\pi \alpha' \ln(s/s_0)$.

the matrix model from U(N) to O(N). We also explain why these models contain

in the t-channel is needed for a description of the data in the second
resonance region. The data are well represented if this channel is modeled by a
single pole with mass parameter m(sigma)=600 MeV. The asymptotic part of the
spin dependent amplitude is found to be well represented by pi-0-exchange in
the t-channel. A backward spin-polarizability of
gamma(pi)=(-37.1+-0.6(stat+syst)+-3.0(model))x10^{-4}fm^4 has been determined
from data of the first resonance region below 455 MeV. This value is in a good
agreement with predictions of dispersion relations and chiral pertubation
theory. From a subset of data between 280 and 360 MeV the resonance
pion-photoproduction amplitudes were evaluated leading to a E2/M1 multipole

experimental EDM search based on this technique was published, and for a number
of reasons including high sample conductivity, high operating temperature, and
limited SQUID technology, the result was not particularly sensitive compared to
other experiments in the late 1970's.
  Advances in SQUID and conventional magnetometery had led us to reconsider
this type of experiment, which can be extended to searches and tests other than
EDMs (e.g., test of Lorentz invariance). In addition, the complementary
measurement of an EDM-induced sample electric polarization due to application
of a magnetic field to a paramagnetic sample might be effective using modern
ultrasensitive charge measurement techniques. A possible paramagnetic material
is Gd-substituted YIG which has very low conductivity and a net enhancement
(atomic enhancement times crystal screening) of order unity. Use of a

the unitary invariants of a measuring process, we present the most general form
of a possible integral representation of an instrument, which differs from the
representations of an instrument available in the mathematical and physical
literature. We introduce the notion of a quantum stochastic representation of
an instrument, whose elements are wholly determined by the unitary invariants
of a measuring process. We show that the description of a generalized direct
quantum measurement can be considered in the frame of a new general approach,
which we call the quantum stochastic approach (QSA), based on the notion of a
family of quantum stochastic evolution operators, satisfying the orthonormality
relation and describing the conditional evolution of a quantum system under a
measurement. The QSA allows to give: a) the complete statistical description of
any generalized direct quantum measurement (a POV measure and a family of
posterior states); b) the complete description in a Hilbert space of the
stochastic behaviour of a quantum system under a measurement in the sense of
specification of the probabilistic transition law governing the change from the
initial state of a quantum system to a final one under a single measurement; c)
to formalize the consideration of all possible types of quantum measurements.
For measurements continuous in time the QSA allows, in particular, to define in
the most general case (without assuming any Markov property) the notion of
posterior pure state trajectories (quantum trajectories) and to give their
probabilistic treatment.

of a finite number of steps evolving in time according to a finite number of
basic Hamiltonians, which are controlled by on-off switches. As a working
example, the case of a particular implementation of the two qubit computer
employing a simple system of two coupled Josephson junctions is considered. The
binary values of the switches together with the time durations of the steps
constitute the quantum machine language of the system.

  Interference",,"10.1080/09500340110065781",,"quant-ph",,"  We discuss the connection between quantum interference effects in optical
beams and radiation fields emitted from atomic systems. We illustrate this
connection by a study of the first- and second-order correlation functions of
optical fields and atomic dipole moments. We explore the role of correlations
between the emitting systems and present examples of practical methods to
implement two systems with non-orthogonal dipole moments. We also derive
general conditions for quantum interference in a two-atom system and for a
control of spontaneous emission. The relation between population trapping and
dark states is also discussed. Moreover, we present quantum dressed-atom models
of cancellation of spontaneous emission, amplification on dark transitions,
fluorescence quenching and coherent population trapping.
