polarization in both objects rises rapidly toward the blue, peaks near 3000 A
in the rest frame and remains nearly constant for shorter wavelengths. The rest
frame optical polarized flux density spectra also increase rapidly towards the
blue, but then decrease dramatically below 3000 A. This distinctive wavelength
dependence of polarized flux shows that the polarization is produced by dust
scattering. As for many Seyfert, radio and Hyperluminous Infrared Galaxies
(HIGs), the lower polarization of the weak [O III] 4959,5007 lines in IRAS
13349+2438 suggests that the scattering grains lie interior to, or mixed with
the narrow line gas. We construct full radiative transfer models of these
systems consisting of a dusty sphere of modest optical depth illuminated
axisymmetrically from within by a powerlaw QSO spectrum. We show that this
simple model successfully reproduces the qualitative polarization properties of
the objects. Despite similarities to other IRAS-selected BALQSOs, our FOS
spectropolarimetry of IRAS 13349+2438 does not reveal broad absorption lines.
IRAS 14026+4341 has an Al III BAL in both scattered and total flux density. We

threaded by quantized vortex lines. The pinning force from lattice nuclei and
the Magnus force from neutron superfluid act onto a vortex line that has a
finite tension. The configuration of a vortex line in equilibrium comprises a
number of pinned straight lengths separated by unpinned kinks when the rotation
axis is slightly inclined to the major axis of a crystal lattice and the Magnus
force is not so strong. Energy of $\sim 4 {MeV}$ is required to form a kink at
densities of $\sim 3.4 \times 10^{13}{g cm}^{-3}$. Magnus force makes the
vortex line parabolic on global scale. There exist two modes, rotational and
helical (Kelvin), for oscillations allowed on a vortex line. The vortex
oscillations in the pinned straight segments are possible only above a minimum
frequency. We find no unstable mode that grows with time. Hence, the vortex
configurations with kinks may be stable and yield the strongly pinned state.
The essence of our results may not be altered even when we consider the vortex
behaviors in a polycrystalline structure. Our studies suggest that pinning of a
vortex line in a polycrystalline structure would be still strong enough to
explain the large glitches.

X-ray data show that several discrete sources embedded in complex diffuse
emission contribute ~>20 of the total emission (L_x^tot ~8E41 ergs/s in the
0.5-10 keV energy range). The compact sources are hard and extremely bright and
their emission is probably dominated by accretion driven processes. Both galaxy
nuclei are detected with L_x ~3-10E40 ergs/s. No evidence is found for the
presence of an active nucleus in the southern nucleus, contrary to previous
speculation. Once the discrete sources are removed, the diffuse component has a
soft spectrum which can be modelled by the superposition of 3 thermal plasma
components with temperatures kT = 0.6, 0.9 and 3.9 keV. Alternatively, the
latter component can be described as a power-law with index Gamma ~3. Some
evidence is found for a radial gradient of the amount of absorption and
temperature of the diffuse component. We compare the X-ray emission with
optical, Halpha and NICMOS images of NGC3256 and find a good correlation
between the inferred optical/near-IR and X-ray extinctions. Although Inverse
Compton scattering could be important in explaining the hard X-rays seen in the
compact sources associated with the nuclei, the observed diffuse emission is
probably of thermal origin. The observed X-ray characteristics support a
scenario in which the powerful X-ray emission is driven solely by the current
episode of star formation.

growth of structures via particle dynamics.
  A crucial problem concerns the setting-up of the initial particle
distribution, as standard theories of galaxy formation predict the properties
of the initial continuous density field with small amplitude correlated
Gaussian fluctuations. The discretisation of such a field is a complex issue
and particle fluctuations are especially relevant at small scales where
non-linear dynamics firstly takes place. In general, most of the procedures
which may discretise a continuous field, gives rise to Poisson noise, which
would then dominate the non-linear small-scales dynamics due to
nearest-neighbours interactions. In order to avoid such a noise, and to
consider the dynamics as due only to large scale (smooth) fluctuations, an
ad-hoc method (lattice or glassy system plus correlated displacements) has been
introduced and used in cosmological simulations. We show that such a method
gives rise to a particle distribution which does not have any of the
correlation properties of the theoretical continuous density field. This is
because discreteness effects, different from Poisson noise but nevertheless
very important, determine particle fluctuations at any scale, making it
completely different from the original continuous field. We conclude that
discreteness effects play a central role in the non-linear evolution of N-body
simulations.

up to I=23. The redshift distribution extends to z~1.1, the resolution is Delta
cz=12000 km s^-1. Thus the amplitude of the three-dimensional correlation
function has to be estimated by means of the projected correlation function
w(r_p). The validity of the deprojection was tested on the Las Campanas
Redshift Survey (LCRS). The LCRS also serves as ''local'' measurement. We
invented a new method to overcome the influence of redshift errors on w(r_p).
For evolution of the clustering strength the ansatz xi(r_com,z)proportional to
(1+z)^q is used. For the galaxies as a whole the evolution parameter turns out
to be q~-1.9, according to the prediction of linear theory. A formal dependency
on the cosmology is presumably due to the small number of fields observed.
However, the measured clustering growth clearly depends on Hubble type. At z~1
early type galaxies are already much stronger clustered, an increase with q~-1
is sufficient to explain the present day amplitude of the correlation function.

intervening dust -- which have long been suspected to affect DLA surveys in

  Starting from initially static envelope structures at various stages during

found that rapidly grow into shocks. Improved analytical concepts give a new
direction to the interpretation of such highly non-adiabatic radial pulsations.
  For direct observational confirmation a search for short period variability
in the UV and soft X-ray is suggested during the very late decline phase.

the finite-temperature Lanczos method for finite two-dimensional clusters.
Numerical results are additionally compared with the self consistent Born
approximation (SCBA) results for hole-like (photoemission) and electron-like
(inverse photoemission) spectra at T=0. The analysis is suggesting that the
origin of the pseudo gap is in short-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin
correlations and strong asymmetry between the hole and electron spectra in the
underdoped regime. We analyze also the electron momentum distribution function
(EMD). Our analytical results for a single hole in an AFM based on the SCBA
indicate an anomalous momentum dependence of EMD showing ""hole pockets""
coexisting with a signature of an emerging large Fermi surface (FS). The
position of the incipient FS and the structure of the EMD is determined by the
momentum of the ground state. The main observation is the coexistence of two
apparently contradicting FS scenarios. On the one hand, the delta-function like
contributions at (pi/2,pi/2) indicate, that for finite doping a pocket-like
small FS evolves from these points, provided provided that AFM long range order
persists. On the other hand, the discontinuity which appears at the same
momentum is more consistent with with infinitesimally short arc (point) of an
emerging large FS.

built only from the gravitational data. Thus it defines a gravitational spin
expression at the future null infinity. The construction based on the

diagrams need to be drawn and integrations carried out at any single stage of

subdivergences can be cleanly isolated. As an illustration we enumerate the
graphs contributing to the 4-loop free energy in QCD, explicitly in a continuum
and more compactly in a lattice regularization.

simple Lie algebras g with twist carriers containing the maximal nilpotent
subalgebra N^+(g) is studied. Our main tool is the sequence of regular
subalgebras g_i in U(g) that become primitive under the action of extended
jordanian twists F_E: U(g) -> U_E(g). It is demonstrated that the structure of
the sequence {g_i} is defined by the extended Dynkin diagram of algebra g. To
construct the injection of g_i in U_E(g) the special deformations of algebras
U_E(g) are performed. They are reduced to the (cohomologically trivial) twists
F_s. Thus it is proved that full chains of twists can be written in the
canonical form F_B = F'_N ... F'_2F'_1. The links F'_i in such chains must
contain not only the extended twists F_E but also the factors F_s whose form
depend on the type of the series of classical algebra g. The explicit forms of
universal R-matrices (and the R-matrices in the fundamental representations)
corresponding to full chains of twists for classical simple Lie algebras are
found. The properties of the construction are illustrated by the example of
full chain of extended twists for algebra sp(3).

few local minima. A new technique is suggested for determination of the
critical energy of the transition to chaos. It is simpler than criteria of
transition to chaos connected with one or another version of overlap resonances
criterion. We have numerically demonstrated that for potential with a localized
unstable region motion becomes regular at the high energy again, i.e.
transition regularity-chaos-regularity {R - C - R} takes place for these

investigations is the set of QCD Dyson--Schwinger equations truncated to
ladder-rainbow level. The infrared structure of the ladder-rainbow kernel is
described by two parameters; the ultraviolet behavior is fixed by the one-loop
renormalizaton group behavior of QCD. The work is restricted to the $u$, $d$
and $s$ quark sector and allows a Poincar\'e-covariant study of the masses and
electroweak decay constants of the ground state pseudoscalars and vectors:
$\pi$, $K$, $\rho/\omega$, $K^\star$ and $\phi$. Within the impulse
approximation, we summarize results for the $\pi$ and $K$ charge form factors.
Their timelike behavior exhibits the vector meson production resonances and
from this the associated vector meson strong decay constants are extracted. The
confining property of the quark self-energy dynamically produced in this work
prevents the appearance of spurious $\bar{q}q$ production effects. The finite
temperature behavior of this model, and closely related ones, is summarized
for: the chiral restoration transition, the deconfinement transition, the
$T$-dependence of the spatial meson mode masses, and the $T$-dependence of
selected electroweak and strong decay widths. The $T$-dependence obtained for
meson masses is compared to results from lattice QCD.

first party, while the second party cannot determine the bit value from the
evidence alone. It is widely believed that unconditionally secure quantum bit
commitment is impossible due to quantum entanglement cheating, which is
codified in a general impossibility theorem. In this paper, the scope of this
general impossibility proof is analyzed, and gaps are found. Two variants of a
bit commitment scheme utilizing anonymous quantum states and decoy states are
presented. In the first variant, the exact verifying measurement is independent
of the committed bit value, thus the second party can make it before the first
party opens, making possible an unconditional security proof based on
no-cloning. In the second variant, the impossibility proof fails because
quantum entanglement purification of a mixed state does not render the protocol
determinate. Whether impossibility holds in this or similar protocols is an
open question, although preliminary results already show that the impossibility
proof cannot work as it stands.

are naturally arised from the physical consideration of checking multipartite
mixed states by measuring them with multipartite separable pure states. The
algebraic sets have to be the sum of linear subspaces if the multipartite mixed
state is separable, and thus we give a new separability criterion of
multipartite mixed states. A continuous family of 4-party mixed states, whose
members are separable for any 2:2 cut and entangled for any 1:3 cut (thus bound
entanglement if 4 parties are isolated), is constructed and studied from our
invariants and separability criterion. Examples of LOCC-incomparable entangled
tripartite pure states are given to show it is hopeless to characterize the
entanglement properties of tripartite pure states by only using the eigenvalue
speactra of their partial traces. We also prove that at least $n^2+n-1$ terms
