Tucana located at the outskirts of the LG. Among the M 31 dSph companions only
Andromeda I and VI show obvious gradients. In all cases where a HB morphology
gradient is visible, the red HB stars are more centrally concentrated. The
occurence of a HB morphological gradient shows a correlation with a morphology
gradient in the red giant branch. It seems likely that metallicity is the
driver of the gradients in Sextans, Sculptor, Tucana, and Andromeda VI, while
age is an important factor in Carina. We find no evidence that the vicinity of
a nearby massive spiral galaxy influences the formation of the population
gradients.

the high energy event coordinates. To date, that single observation remains
unique as no other prompt flashes have been seen for other bursts observed with
comparably short response times. This suggests that in general GRB prompt

instability in a collisionless stellar system. The underlying perturbation
equations govern the Lagrangian displacement of a star in the six-dimensional

method is developed in detail for radial oscillations of a spherical system.
The basis vectors required for the representation of the Lagrangian
displacement in this case are derived from solutions of the Lagrangian
perturbation equations for radial perturbations in a homogeneous sphere. The
basis vectors are made divergence free in the six-dimensional phase space in
accordance with the requirement of Liouville's theorem that the flow of the
system in the phase space must be incompressible. The basis vectors are made
orthogonal with respect to a properly chosen set of adjoint vectors with the
aid of a Gram-Schmidt procedure. Some basis vectors are null vectors in the
sense that their inner products with their own adjoint vectors vanish. The
characteristic frequencies of the lowest radial modes are calculated in several
approximations for members of a family of spherical models which span a wide
range of central concentrations. The present formulation of the matrix method

on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are beginning to independently place
strong complementary bounds on the epoch of hydrogen reionization. Parameter
estimation from current CMB data continues, however, to be subject to several
degeneracies. Here, we focus on those degeneracies in CMB parameter forecasts
related to the optical depth to reionization. We extend earlier work on the
mutual constraints that such analyses of CMB data and a reionization model may
place on each other to a more general parameter set, and to the case of data
anticipated from the $MAP$ satellite. We focus in particular on a semi-analytic
model of reionization by the first stars, although the methods here are easily
extended to other reionization scenarios. A reionization model can provide
useful complementary information for cosmological parameter (CP) extraction
from the CMB, particularly for the degeneracies between the optical depth and
either of the amplitude and index of the primordial scalar power spectrum,
which are still present in the most recent data. Alternatively, by using a
reionization model, known limits on astrophysical quantities can reduce the
forecasted errors on CPs. Forthcoming CMB data also have the potential to
constrain the sites of early star formation, as well as the fraction of baryons
that participate in it. Finally, we examine the implications of an independent,
e.g., spectroscopic, determination of the epoch of reionization for the
determination of CPs from the CMB. This has the potential to significantly
strengthen limits from the CMB on parameters such as the index of the power
spectrum, while having the considerable advantage of being free of the choice

including cosmic variance and determine the impact of systematic effects on
application of this test to the upcoming DEEP2 Redshift Survey. For DEEP2,
cosmic variance should yield errors roughly twice those predicted from Poisson
statistics. Through Monte Carlo simulations we find that if the functional
form, but not the strength, of any of the major systematic effects (baryonic
infall, velocity errors, and incompleteness) is known, the systematic may
successfully be corrected for using the observed velocity function, leaving a
much smaller residual error. The total uncertainty from systematics is
comparable to that from cosmic variance, but correlated amongst redshift bins.

the constraints on dark energy models that counts of DEEP2 clusters should

significantly stronger constraints than the redshift distribution alone. The

the interstellar extinction or the distance to the source; instead these are
determined self-consistently from the observed light curves. In order to obtain
tighter limits on the model parameters, we used the distance determination from

for the extinction that is lower than was assumed previously; this leads to
lower masses for both the black hole and the secondary star of 5.4 +/- 0.3 Msun

blockade effects that reflect an oscillatory term in the dots' total energy
whose value depends on whether the total number of electrons on the dots is
even or odd. The effective energy associated with this even-odd alternation is
reduced, relative to the bare Coulomb blockade energy for uncoupled dots, by a
factor (1-f) that decreases as the interdot coupling is increased. When the
transmission coefficient for interdot electronic motion is independent of
energy and the same for all channels within the point contact (which are
assumed uncoupled), the factor (1-f) takes on a universal value determined
solely by the number of channels and the dimensionless conductance g of each
individual channel.
  This paper studies corrections to the universal value of (1-f) that result
when the transmission coefficent varies over energy scales of the size of the
bare Coulomb blockade energy. We consider a model in which the point contact is
described by a single orbital channel containing a parabolic barrier potential,
and we calculate the leading correction to (1-f) for one-channel (spin-split)
and two-channel (spin-degenerate) point contacts in the limit where the single
orbital channel is almost completely open. By generalizing a previously used
bosonization technique, we find that, for a given value of the dimensionless
conductance g, the value of (1-f) is increased relative to its value for a
zero-thickness barrier, but the absolute value of the increase is small in the
region where our calculations apply.

including collinearly enhanced, inelastic processes such as bremsstrahlung.
These inelastic processes receive O(1) modifications from multiple scattering
during the photon emission process, which limits the coherence length of the
emitted radiation (the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect). We perform a
diagrammatic analysis to identify, and sum, all leading-order contributions. We
find that the leading-order photon emission rate is not sensitive to
non-perturbative $g^2 T$ scale dynamics. We derive an integral equation for the

constructed in the four dimensional N=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory with gauge
group SU(N). These quarter-BPS operators share many non-renormalization

much more involved, which renders their construction nontrivial in the fully

local, polynomial, scalar composite operators within a given representation of
the SU(4) R-symmetry group. By studying these two-point functions, we identify
the eigenstates of the dilatation operator, which turn out to be complicated
mixtures of single and multiple trace operators.
  Given the elaborate combinatorics of this problem, we concentrate on two
special cases. First, we present explicit computations for quarter-BPS
operators with scaling dimension Delta < 8. In this case, the discussion
applies to arbitrary N of the gauge group. Second, we carry out a leading plus

normalization. Here, we compute three-point functions involving these
quarter-BPS operators along with half-BPS operators. The combinatorics of the
problem is rather involved, and we consider the following special cases: (1)
correlators < half half BPS > of two half-BPS primaries with an arbitrary
chiral primary; (2) certain classes of < half quarter quarter > and < quarter

possess the F. and M. Riesz property. That is, if $\Omega$ is an open subset of
the plane with smooth boundary, $u\in C^1(\Omega)$ satisfies $Lu=0$ on
$\Omega$, has tempered growth at the boundary, and its weak boundary value is a
measure $\mu$, then $\mu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue
measure on the noncharacteristic portion of $\partial\Omega$.

C65 (2002) 054312","10.1103/PhysRevC.65.054312",,"nucl-th",,"  The properties of the pairing interaction in the shell model framework are
considered with the aid of the exact numerical solution utilizing the quasispin
symmetry. We emphasize the features which are out of reach for the usual
approximate techniques based on the BCS approach supplemented by the random
phase approximation treatment of pair vibrations, especially in the region of
weak pairing where the BCS+RPA theory fails. For the first time chaotic aspects
of the mixing generated by the pairing interaction are studied. The level
repulsion and large information entropy of the eigenstates coexist with the
absence of thermalization of single-particle motion. The full spectrum of pair
vibration in average displays the spin dependence similar to that for a rigid
rotor.

adapting to NK fitness landscapes. We find that, unlike in the case of an
infinite population, the average fitness in a finite population is maximized at
a small but finite, rather than vanishing, mutation rate. The highest local
maxima in the landscape are visited for even larger mutation rates, close to a
transition point at which the population delocalizes (i.e., leaves the fitness
peak at which it was localized) and starts traversing the sequence space. If
the mutation rate is increased even further, the population undergoes a second
transition and loses all sensitivity to fitness peaks. This second transition
corresponds to the standard error threshold transition first described by
Eigen. We discuss the implications of our results for biological evolution and
for evolutionary optimization techniques.

"quant-ph/0109034","David Marcus Appleby","D.M. Appleby","Nullification of the Nullification","23 pages, 2 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A recent claim by Meyer, Kent and Clifton (MKC), that their models
``nullify'' the Kochen-Specker theorem, has attracted much comment. In this
paper we present a new counter-argument, based on the fact that a classical
measurement reveals, not simply a pre-existing value, but pre-existing
classical information. In the MKC models measurements do not generally reveal
pre-existing classical information. Consequently, the Kochen-Specker theorem is
not nullified. We go on to prove a generalized version of the Kochen-Specker
theorem, applying to non-ideal quantum measurements. The theorem was inspired
by the work of Simon et al and Larsson (SBZL). However, there is a loophole in
SBZL's argument, which means that their result is invalid (operational
non-contextuality is not inconsistent with the empirical predictions of quantum
mechanics). Our treatment resolves this difficulty. We conclude by discussing
the question, whether the MKC models can reproduce the empirical predictions of
quantum mechanics.

within schemes of alternating microwave-optical double resonance. A
well-defined amount of decoherence may be applied to the system when spurious
resonance light is admitted simultaneously with the driving radiation. This
decoherence is quantified in terms of longitudinal and transversal relaxation.
It may serve for calibrating observed decoherence as well as for testing
error-correcting quantum codes.

Initialization is accomplished by optical pumping, algorithmic cooling, and
pseudo-pure state techniques. Magnetic resonance force microscopy is used for
readout. This proposal takes advantage of many of the successful aspects of
solution NMR quantum computation, including ensemble measurement, RF control,
and long decoherence times, but it allows for more qubits and improved
initialization.
