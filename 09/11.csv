full range of density enhancements, from single galaxies to clusters of

Optical Galaxy (NOG) sample, which is the largest, all-sky catalog of
objectively- identified bound objects presently available. We find that the
B-band luminosity function of systems is insensitive to the choice of the
group-finding algorithms and is well described, over the absolute-magnitude

systems is ~3 times brighter than that of the luminosity function of galaxies.
Our results show that half of the luminosity of the universe is generated in
systems with L<2.9 Lstar and that 10% of the overall luminosity density is
supplied by systems with L>30 Lstar. We find a significant environmental
dependence in the luminosity function of systems, in the sense that overdense
regions, as measured on scales of 5 Mpc, preferentially host brighter, and
presumably more massive, virialized systems.

  Full resolution figures available at http://astro.berkeley.edu/~marinoni",,"10.1086/339319",,"astro-ph",,"  We compare the B-band luminosity function of virialized halos with the mass
function predicted by the Press-Schechter theory in cold dark matter
cosmogonies. We find that all cosmological models fail to match our results if
a constant mass-to-light ratio is assumed. In order for these models to match
the faint end of the luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio decreasing with
luminosity as $L^{-0.5\pm 0.06}$ is required. For a $\Lambda$CDM model, the
mass-to-light function has a minimum of $\sim 100 h^{-1}_{75}$ in solar units
in the $B$-band, corresponding to $\sim 25%$ of the baryons in the form of
stars, and this minimum occurs close to the luminosity of an $L^*$ galaxy. At
the high-mass end, the $\Lambda$CDM model requires a mass-to-light ratio
increasing with luminosity as $L^{+0.5 \pm 0.26}$. We also derive the halo
occupation number, i.e. the number of galaxies brighter than $\lgal^*$ hosted
in a virialized system. We find that the halo occupation number scales
non-linearly with the total mass of the system, $N\sbr{gal}(>\lgal^*) \propto
m^{0.55\pm0.026}$ or the $\Lambda$CDM model. We find a break in the power-law
slope of the X-ray-to-optical luminosity relation, independent of the
cosmological model. This break occurs at a scale corresponding to poor groups.
In the $\Lambda$CDM model, the poor-group mass is also the scale at which the
mass-to-light ratio of virialized systems begins to increase. This
correspondence suggests a physical link between star formation and the X-ray
properties of halos, possibly due to preheating by supernovae or to efficient
cooling of low-entropy gas into galaxies.

emission from the brightest knot (A) is marginally upstream of the optical
emission peak. Detailed Gaussian fits to the X-ray jet one-dimensional profile
show distinct X-ray emission that is not associated with specific optical

however, is still below the cosmic variance limit of the primary anisotropies;
at further small angular scales, secondary effects such as gravitational
lensing and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect dominates the non-linear

effectively same as the contribution previously described as a lensing effect
due to the transverse motion of gravitational lenses and well known as the
Kaiser-Stebbins effect under the context of cosmic strings. Due to geometrical
considerations, there is no significant three point correlation function, or a
bispectrum, between the linear ISW effects and its non-linear extension. The
non-linear ISW contribution can be potentially used as a probe of the

been measured for the majority of these objects, and this information has been
used to study the completeness of these catalogues, the level of contamination
from foreground and background structures along the cluster's line of sight,
the space density of the clusters as a function of redshift, and their velocity
dispersion distributions. We find that the Abell and EDCC catalogues are
contaminated at the level of about 10%, whereas the APM catalogue suffers only
5% contamination. If we use the original catalog centroids, the level of
contamination rises to approximately 15% for the Abell and EDCC catalogues,
showing that the presence of foreground and background groups may alter the
richness of clusters in these catalogues. There is a deficiency of clusters at
$z \sim 0.05$ that may correspond to a large underdensity in the Southern

analytical prescriptions to account for different (but inter-related) aspects
of planetary nebulae, such as: the dynamical evolution of the primary shell and
surrounding ejecta, the photoionisation of H and He by the central star, the
nebular emission of a few relevant optical lines (e.g. Hbeta; HeII4686;
[OIII]5007). Predictions of the synthetic model are tested by comparison with
both findings of hydrodynamical calculations, and observations of Galactic PNe.
The sensitiveness of the results to the models parameters (e.g. transition
time, mass of the central star, H-/He-burning tracks, etc.) is also discussed.
We briefly illustrate the systematic differences that are expected in the
luminosities and lifetimes of PNe with either H- or He-burning central stars,
which result in different ``detection probabilities'' across the H-R diagram,
in both Hbeta and [OIII]5007 lines. Adopting reasonable values of the model
parameters, we are able to reproduce, in a satisfactory way, many general
properties of PNe, like the ionised mass--nebular radius relationship, the
trends of a few main nebular line ratios, and the observed ranges of nebular
shell thicknesses, electron densities, and expansion velocities. The models
naturally predict also the possible transitions from optically-thick to
optically-thin configurations (and vice versa). In this context, the origin of
the Zanstra discrepancy is also analysed. (abridged)

and related systems, combining detailed binary-population synthesis (BPS)
models with a grid of 120 binary evolution sequences calculated with a
Henyey-type stellar evolution code. In these sequences, we used 3 masses for
the white dwarf (0.6, 0.8, 1.0 Msun) and seven masses for the donor star in the
range of 0.6-1.4 Msun. The shortest orbital periods were chosen to have
initially unevolved secondaries, and the longest orbital period for each
secondary mass was taken to be just longer than the bifurcation period (16 - 22
hr), beyond which systems evolve towards long orbital periods. These
calculations show that systems which start with evolved secondaries near the
end or just after their main-sequence phase become ultra-compact systems with
periods as short as 7 min. These systems are excellent candidates for AM CVn
stars. Using a standard BPS code, we show how the properties of CVs at the
beginning of mass transfer depend on the efficiency for common-envelope (CE)
ejection and the efficiency of magnetic braking. In our standard model, where
CE ejection is efficient, some 10 per cent of all CVs have initially evolved
secondaries (with a central hydrogen abundance X_c < 0.4) and ultimately become
ultra-compact systems (implying a Galactic birthrate for AM CVn-like stars of
10^{-3} yr^{-1}). Almost all CVs with orbital periods longer than 5 hr are
found to have initially evolved or relatively massive secondaries. We show that

one is detected strongly at 90 microns, indicating that mostly they are very
cold, with typical temperatures of only 10-20K. Colour temperature images are
constructed for each of the cores. Most of the cores are seen to be either
isothermal, or to have associated temperature gradients from the core centres
to their edges, with all except one being cooler at the centre. We compare the
data with previous ISOCAM absorption data and calculate the energy balance for
those cores in common between the two samples. We find that the energy radiated
by each core in the far-IR is similar to that absorbed at shorter wavelengths.
Hence there is no evidence for a central heating source in any of the cores -
even those for which previous evidence for core contraction exists. This is all
consistent with external heating of the cores by the local interstellar
radiation field, confirming their pre-stellar nature.

(1) new magnetized cold jet solutions consistent with the underlying accretion

$10^4$ K, but ionization fractions are revised downward by a factor of 10-100.
This is due to previous omission of thermal speeds in ion-neutral
momentum-exchange rates and to different jet solutions. The physical origin of
the hot temperature plateau is outlined. In particular we present three
analytical criteria for the presence of a hot plateau, applicable to any given
MHD wind solution where ambipolar diffusion and adiabatic expansion are the
dominant heating and cooling terms. We finally show that, for solutions favored

very few data exist for comparison with theoretical predictions. It is however
commonly agreed that this emission hides important clues on the GRB physics and
can be used to constrain the fireball parameters, the acceleration and emission
processes and to probe the surroundings of the GRBs. ECLAIRs is a
microsatellite devoted to the observation of the prompt optical and X-ray
emission of GRBs. For about 150 GRBs/yr, independent of their duration, ECLAIRs
will provide high time resolution high sensitivity spectral coverage from a few
eV up to ~50 keV and localization to ~ 5'' in near real time. This capability
is achieved by combining wide field optical and X-ray cameras sharing a common
field of view (>~ 2.2 steradians) with the coded-mask imaging telescopes
providing the triggers and the coarse localizations of the bursts. Given the
delays to start ground-based observations in response to a GRB trigger, ECLAIRs
is unique in its ability to observe the early phases (the first ~20 sec) of all
GRBs at optical wavelengths. Furthermore, with its mode of operation, ECLAIRs
will enable to search for optical and X-ray precursors expected from
theoretical grounds. Finally ECLAIRsis proposed to operate simultaneously with
GLAST on a similar orbit. This combination will both provide unprecedented

results in quadratic type dependence of (rho)_(Jff)(B) with the following
saturation. The I-V characteristics in JFF regime also can be described

the external mm-wave radiation. The step position is proportional to the
frequency of applied microwaves and corresponds to the Josephson emission from
all the 60 intrinsic junctions of the stack being synchronized. That implies
the coherence of the JFF over the whole thickness of the stack and demonstrates
possibility of synchronization of intrinsic junctions by magnetic field. We
also found a threshold character of an appearance of the JFF branch on the I-V
characteristic with the increase of magnetic field, the threshold field B_t
being scaled with the junction size perpendicular to the field L (L = 30-1.4

the two time scales involved, namely the thermodynamic relaxation time of the

dynamically broken symmetric phases appear spontaneously when both become
comparable. A particularly simple case is that of an Ising ferromagnet below
its static critical temperature, when it is perturbed for a short duration by a
pulsed magnetic field competing with the existing order in the system. If the
field strength and duration is more than the threshold (dependent on the
temperature), the system, and consequently the magnetization, switches from one
minimum to the other of the static free energy. This magnetization reversal
transition here shows intriguing dynamic transition behaviour, similar to those
for oscillating fields. Monte Carlo studies for such dynamic transitions are
discussed and compared with the mean field results for the same and the Monte
Carlo results for the oscillating field case. In particular, we discuss about
the Monte Carlo results for the fluctuations and their growth behaviour near

laws is rarely sufficient to assure a business that it has limited its exposure
to legal risk. The paper identifies why the challenge of adequately accounting
for the legal risk arising from Internet jurisdiction has been aggravated in
recent years by the adoption of the Zippo legal framework, commonly referred to
as the passive versus active test. The test provides parties with only limited
guidance and often results in detrimental judicial decisions from a policy
perspective. Given the inadequacies of the Zippo passive versus active test,
the paper argues that it is now fitting to identify a more effective standard
for determining when it is appropriate to assert jurisdiction in cases
involving predominantly Internet-based contacts. The solution submitted in the
paper is to move toward a targeting-based analysis. Unlike the Zippo approach,
a targeting analysis would seek to identify the intentions of the parties and
to assess the steps taken to either enter or avoid a particular jurisdiction.
Targeting would also lessen the reliance on effects-based analysis, the source
of considerable uncertainty since Internet-based activity can ordinarily be
said to create some effects in most jurisdictions. To identify the appropriate
criteria for a targeting test, the paper recommends returning to the core
jurisdictional principle -- foreseeability. Foreseeability in the targeting
context depends on three factors -- contracts, technology, and actual or
implied knowledge.

cyclically on a manifold are considered. The structure of the group is found to
be considerably restricted by the existence of a one-dimensional subgroup whose
orbits are circles. The results proved do not depend on the dimension of the
manifold nor on the existence of a metric, but merely on the fact that the Lie
group acts globally on the manifold. Firstly some results for the general case
of an $m+1$-dimensional Lie group are derived: those commutators of the
associated Lie algebra involving the generator of the cyclic subgroup, $X_0$
say, are severely restricted and, in a suitably chosen basis, take a simple
form. The Jacobi identities involving $X_0$ are then applied to show there are
further restrictions on the structure of the Lie algebra. All Lie algebras of
dimensions 2 and 3 compatible with cyclic symmetry are obtained. In the
two-dimensional case the group must be Abelian. For the three-dimensional case,
the Bianchi type of the Lie algebra must be I, II, III, VII$_0$, VIII or IX and
furthermore in all cases the vector $X_0$ forms part of a basis in which the
algebra takes its canonical form. Finally four-dimensional Lie algebras
compatible with cyclic symmetry are considered and the results are related to
the Petrov-Kruchkovich classification of all four-dimensional Lie algebras.

  From this analysis, we recover a formula of Falk for $\phi_3$, and obtain a
new formula for $\phi_4$. The exact sequence of low degree terms in the
spectral sequence allows us to answer a question of Falk on graphic
arrangements, and also shows that for these arrangements, the algebra $A$ is
Koszul iff the arrangement is supersolvable. We also give combinatorial lower
bounds on the Betti numbers, $b'_{i,i+1}$, of the linear strand of the free
resolution of $A$ over $E$; if the lower bound is attained for $i = 2$, then it
is attained for all $i \ge 2$. For such arrangements, we compute the entire
linear strand of the resolution, and we prove that all components of the first
resonance variety of $A$ are local. For graphic arrangements (which do not
attain the lower bound, unless they have no braid sub-arrangements), we show
that $b'_{i,i+1}$ is determined by the number of triangles and $K_4$ subgraphs
in the graph.

k(t), where k is a number field. Let O be the ring of integers of k. Hilbert's
irreducibility theorem gives infinitely many integral specializations of t to

set Red(O) of those a in O with f(a,X) reducible. We show that Red(O) is a
finite set under rather weak assumptions. In particular, several results of K.
Langmann, obtained by Diophantine approximation techniques, appear as special

elementary group theory, valuation theory, and Siegel's theorem about integral
points on algebraic curves. Indeed, using the Siegel-Lang extension of Siegel's
theorem, most of our results hold over more general fields.

seen in the near-threshold $\pi^+ \pi^-$ invariant mass spectra reported by the

QCD with external sources in the presence of non-vanishing nucleon densities
has been derived recently [1]. Within this approach we derive power counting
rules for the calculation of in-medium pion properties. We develop the
so-called standard rules for residual nucleon energies of the order of the pion
mass and a modified scheme (non-standard counting) for vanishing residual
nucleon energies. We also establish the different scales for the range of
applicability of this perturbative expansion, which are \sqrt{6}\pi f_\pi\simeq
0.7 GeV for the standard and 6\pi^2 f_\pi^2/2m_N\simeq 0.27 GeV for
non-standard counting, respectively. We have performed a systematic analysis of
n-point in-medium Green functions up to and including next-to-leading order
when the standard rules apply. These include the in-medium contributions to
quark condensates, pion propagators, pion masses and couplings of the
axial-vector, vector and pseudoscalar currents to pions. In particular, we find
a mass shift for negatively charged pions in heavy nuclei that agrees with
recent determinations from deeply bound pionic Pb-207. We have also established
the absence of in-medium renormalization in the \pi^0 \to \gamma\gamma decay
amplitude up to the same order. The study of \pi\pi scattering requires the use
of the non-standard counting and the calculation is done at leading order. Even
at that order we establish new contributions not considered so far. We also
point towards further possible improvements of this scheme and touch upon its
relation to more conventional many-body approaches.
