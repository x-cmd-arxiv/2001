intermediate-redshift (0 < z < 0.4) galaxies in the context of their physical
nature and star formation history. This work represents an extension of our
previous studies (Treyer et al. 1998; Sullivan et al. 2000, 2001) on
UV-selected galaxies. We revisit the optical spectra of these galaxies and
perform further emission-line measurements restricting the analysis to those
spectra with the full set of emission lines required to derive chemical
abundances. Our final sample consists of 68 galaxies with heavy element
abundance ratios and both UV and CCD B-band photometry. Diagnostics based on
emission-line ratios show that all but one of the galaxies in our sample are
powered by hot, young stars rather than by an AGN. Oxygen-to-hydrogen (O/H) and
nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) abundance ratios are compared to those for various
local and intermediate-redshift samples. Our UV-selected galaxies span a wide
range of oxygen abundances, from 0.1 Zsun to solar, intermediate between
low-mass HII galaxies and massive starburst nuclei. For a given oxygen
abundance, most have strikingly low N/O values. Moreover, UV-selected and HII
galaxies systematically deviate from the usual metallicity-luminosity relation
in the sense of being more luminous by 2-3 magnitudes. Adopting the
""delayed-release"" chemical evolution model, we propose our UV-selected sources
are observed at a special stage in their evolution, following a powerful
starburst which enriched their ISM in oxygen and temporarily lowered their
mass-to-light ratios. We discuss briefly the implications of our conclusions on
the nature of similarly-selected high-redshift galaxies.

  Marseille, June 2001",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present the three-dimensional power spectrum of galaxy clustering using
measurements of the angular correlation function from the second incremental
release of the Two-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). The angular positions of
galaxies out to a limiting magnitude of K_s <= 14.0 (508,054 galaxies)
determine the correlation function. We consider a variety of estimators of the
catalog's angular correlation function, and we find the Landy and Szalay (LS)
estimator to be the most reliable choice. Using the LS estimator, we find that
the angular correlation function takes the form of a power law with a break.
The angular correlation function is then used in combination with the selection
function to determine the power spectrum by inverting Limber's equation. We
find good agreement with previous measurements of the power spectrum for 0.04 <
k < 0.1 h Mpc^-1, and evidence for a peak in the power spectrum around k = 0.03
h Mpc^-1. For k > 0.1 h Mpc^-1 we find that the power spectrum is biased higher
than other surveys, which can be understood as a color-based selection effect.

numerical calculations. In particular, this would lead to weaker constraints on
the spectral index $n$. We then derive constraints on inflationary models from
the fact that primordial black holes must not overclose the Universe. This is
done both for the scale-free case of the power spectrum studied earlier and for
the case where a step in the mass variance is superimposed. In the former case
we find various constraints on $n$, depending on the parameters. In the latter
case these limits can be much more strengthened, so that one could find from an
observational limit on $n$ a constraint on the allowed height of the step.

the inner radio jet. Fitting the Padova isochrones on UV color-magnitude

describe the early stages of the dynamics of gravitational clustering. We show
that for hierarchical scenarios with no small-scale cutoff perturbation theory
always breaks down beyond a finite order $q_+$. Besides, the degree of
divergence increases with the order of the perturbative terms so that
renormalization procedures cannot be applied. Nevertheless, we explain that
despite the divergence of these subleading terms the results of perturbation
theory are correct at leading order because they can be recovered through a
steepest-descent method which does not use such perturbative expansions.
Finally, we investigate the simpler cases of the Zel'dovich and Burgers
dynamics. In particular, we show that the standard Burgers equation exhibits
similar properties. This analogy suggests that the results of the standard
perturbative expansions are valid up to the order $q_+$ (i.e. until they are
finite). Moreover, the first ``non-regular'' term of a large-scale expansion of
the two-point correlation function should be of the form $R^{-2} \sigma^2(R)$.
At higher orders the large-scale expansion should no longer be over powers of
$\sigma^2$ but over a different combination of powers of 1/R. However, its
calculation requires new non-perturbative methods.

intense dipping activity. A sinusoid-like OM $B$-band modulation with a
peak-to-peak modulation of 0.5 magnitude and a minimum coincident with the

the only X-ray binaries known to exhibit narrow X-ray absorption lines were two
superluminal jet sources and it had been suggested that these features are

their presence may be related to the viewing angle of the system. The

known periods. More than 90% of the spectra yielded vsin(i) measurements,
although one-third are upper limits. We find strong evidence confirming the
assumption that the periodic light variations of T Tauri stars are caused by
rotation of surface spots. We find no significant difference between the
vsin(i) distributions of the periodic and control samples, indicating that
there is no strong bias in studying the rotation of young stars using periodic
variables. Likewise, the classical and weak T Tauri stars exhibit vsin(i)
distributions that are statistically the same. For stars with known period and
vsin(i), the mean value of sin(i) is lower than expected for a random
distribution of rotation axes. This could be due to errors in the quantities
that contribute to the sin(i) calculation or to a real physical effect. We find
that mean sin(i) has the expected value if we increase the stars' Teff values
by 400-600 K. Finally, we have calculated minimum radii for stars with vsin(i)

(ASEP) has been considered in the presence of a single impurity on a ring. The
model describes particles hopping in one direction with stochastic dynamics and
hard core exclusion condition. The ordinary particles hop forward with their
characteristic hopping rates and fast particles can overtake slow ones with a
relative rate. The impurity, which is the slowest particle in the ensemble of
particles on the ring, hops in the same direction of the ordinary particles
with its intrinsic hopping rate and can be overtaken by ordinary particles with
a rate which is not necessarily a relative rate. We will show that the phase
diagram of the model can be obtained exactly. It turns out that the phase
structure of the model depends on the density distribution function of the
ordinary particles on the ring so that it can have either four phases or only
one. The mean speed of impurity and also the total current of the ordinary
particles are explicitly calculated in each phase. Using Monte Carlo
simulation, the density profile of the ordinary particles is also obtained. The
simulation data confirm all of the analytical calculations.

practices due to the rapid rate of growth, rapid change in technology,
difficulty in assessing market share for information products like web sites,
and high degree of interconnectivity and alliance formation among corporations.
This paper has provided a fundamental framework that integrates a network and
economic perspective to the search engine market.
  The findings indicate that (1) despite an increasing number of search
engines, barriers to entry seem high, largely due to the exponential growth in
the number of web sites and the non-scalability of the current search
technology and collective switching costs; (2) older search engine sites tend
typically to have more features to lock in users. Using standard economic
indicators (CR4=58% and HHI=1163), the industry looks close to being plagued by
anticompetitive practices. But based on a network adjusted HHI constructed in
this paper, its value, 870, suggests that there is less cause for concern.
  Based on all indicators, it suggests that Yahoo would be a contender. Other
possible contenders are MSN and Netscape. On the basis of results to date, some
search engines keep increasing their audience reach while others don't. The
trend shows that some search engines may dominate the search engine market. We
suggest conducting research in the coverage performance of search engines and
investigate ""information search cost"" as a performance indicator of search
techniques. In addition, we suggest paying attention to any anticompetitive
conduct (e.g. product bundling) that may lesson competition and reduce consumer
welfare. The combination of network theory and economic theory to study the

creation of the ARPANET shows how military, scientific, and academic values
shaped the institutions and relations of a foundational period in the creation
of the Internet.
  The paper probes three areas: the ideology of the science policy consensus,
the institutional philosophy of IPTO under J. C. R. Licklider, and the ways
that this consensus and philosophy shaped IPTO research in the period leading
to the creation of the ARPANET. By examining the intellectual, cultural, and
institutional details of the consensus that governed IPTO research between 1957
and 1969, we can understand the ways that these values defined the range of
possibilities for network computing.
  The influence of the social values expressed by these actors was decisive:
that government had an obligation to support a broad base of scientific
research to promote both the public good and the national defense; that
IPTO-sponsored computing research would accomplish both military and scientific
objectives; and that IPTO could leverage its power within this consensus to
create a network to share resources and unite researchers over geographical
distance. A greater awareness of the ways that ""consensus"" worked in this

  800-Number Portability","29th TPRC Conference, 2001",,,"TPRC-2001-085","cs.CY",,"  Do switching costs reduce or intensify price competition in markets where
firms charge the same price to old and new consumers? Theoretically, the answer
could be either ""yes"" or ""no,"" due to two opposing incentives in firms' pricing
decisions. The firm would like to charge a higher price to previous purchasers
who are ""locked-in"" and a lower price to unattached consumers who offer higher
future profitability. I demonstrate this ambiguity in an infinite-horizon
theoretical model.
  800- (toll-free) number portability provides empirical evidence to answer
this question. Before portability, a customer had to change numbers to change
service providers. This imposed significant switching costs on users, who
generally invested heavily to publicize these numbers. In May 1993 a new
database made 800-numbers portable. This drop in switching costs and
regulations that precluded price discrimination between old and new consumers
provide an empirical test of switching costs' effect on price competition.
  I use contracts for virtual private network (VPN) services to test how AT&T
adjusted its prices for toll-free services in response to portability.
Preliminarily (awaiting completion of data collection), I find that AT&T
reduced margins for VPN contracts containing toll-free services relative to
those that did not as the portability date approached. This implies that the
switching costs due to non-portability made the market less competitive. These
results suggest that, despite toll-free services growing rapidly during this
time period, AT&T's incentive to charge a higher price to ""locked-in"" consumers
exceeded its incentive to capture new consumers in the high switching costs era
of non-portability.

prevalent in larger markets, then the Internet may be a complement for urban
agglomeration. Characterizing the nature of available content using Media

substantially more online local content is available in larger markets.
Combining this with CPS Internet use data, we find statistically significant
direct evidence of both complementarity and substitutability: Individuals are
more likely to connect in markets with more local online content; and holding
local online content constant, are less likely to connect in larger markets. We
also find that individuals connect to overcome local isolation: Blacks are more
likely to connect, relative to whites, when they comprise a smaller fraction of
local population, making the Internet is a substitute for agglomeration of
preference minorities within cities, if not cities themselves. On balance we

aggressive federal initiative to wire rural America, where the market for
electricity had failed, is revisited as the missing incentives are identified
and explored. We then examine the incentive-poor similarities between rural
electrification and rural high-speed Internet access through how consumers
currently and prospectively gain access to broadband Internet service. The
regulatory environment created by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the
Federal Communications Commission is considered. Although the FCC is required
(Section 254.b.3) to take regulatory measures to ensure comparable and
affordable access to the Internet for all Americans, the historical
similarities and comparative analysis of rural electrification and high-speed
Internet access suggests the goal of universal service is unlikely to be met in

first provide an overview of auction models for allocating resources. We then
examine the experience of auctioning spectrum in different countries. Based on
this examination, we posit some axioms that seem to have to be satisfied when
allocating spectrum in most developing countries. In light of these axioms, we
provide a critical evaluation of using Vickrey second- price auctions to
allocate spectrum in developing countries. We suggest the use of a new auction
mechanism, the Vickrey ""share auction"" which will satisfy many of these axioms.

academic literature. Generally, they have been for abstract networks, have not
been focused on the public switched telephone network, or they have not
included the operating costs. This paper presents the operating cost portion of
our ongoing research project comparing circuit-switched and IP network costs
for an existing local exchange carrier.
  We have found that (1) The operating cost differential between IP and circuit
switching for this LEC will be small; and (2) A substantial majority of a
telco's operating cost lies in customer service and outside plant maintenance,
which will be incurred equally in both networks in a pure substitution
scenario. Thus, the operating cost difference lies in the actual cost
differences of the switching technologies. This appears to be less than 10%-15%
of the total operating cost of the network. Thus, even if the cost differences
for substitute services were large, the overall impact on the telco's financial
performance would be small. But IP has some hidden benefits on the operations
side. Most notably, data and voice services could be managed with the same
systems infrastructure, meaning that the incremental operations cost of rolling
out new services would likely be much lower, since it would all be IP.

particles in the $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ Standard Model without
Higgs Sector (SMWHS). We start from the assumption that rest masses correspond
to the effective masses of particles in an elementary quantum fluid at zero
temperature. These effective masses are obtained through radiative corrections,
at one-loop order, in the context of the real time formalism of quantum field
theory at finite temperature and density. The quantum fluid is described in
structure and dynamics by the SMWHS and it is characterized by non-vanishing
chemical potentials associated to the different fermion flavour species.
Starting from the experimental mass values for quarks and leptons, taking the
top quark mass as $m_t = 172.916$ GeV, we can compute, as an evidence of the
consistency of our approach, the experimental central mass values for the
$W^{\pm}$ and $Z^0$ gauge bosons. Subsequently we introduce in the SMWHS a
massless scalar field leading to Yukawa coupling terms in the Lagrangian
density. For this case we can also compute the experimental mass central values
of the $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^0$ gauge bosons using a top quark mass value in the
range 169.2 GeV $< m_{t} < 178.6$ GeV; this range for the top quark mass
implies that the scalar boson mass must be in the range $0 < M_{H} < 152$ GeV.

Z(s)=Det(1-sU) of a quantized map U element of U(N). More precisely, we study
the correlator omega_U(s)=<|Z(st)|^2> (averaging t over the unit circle).
Identifying the group U(N) as one member of a dual pair acting in the spinor
representation of Spin(4N), omega_U(s) is expanded in terms of irreducible
characters of U(N). In close analogy with the ballistic non-linear sigma model,
a coherent-state integral representation of omega_U(s) is developed. We show
that the leading-order saddle-point approximation reproduces omega_U(s)
exactly, up to a constant factor; this miracle can be explained by interpreting
omega_U(s) as a character of U(2N), for which the saddle-point expansion yields
the Weyl character formula. Unfortunately, this decomposition behaves
non-smoothly in the semiclassical limit, and to make further progress some
averaging over U needs to be introduced. Several averaging schemes are
investigated. In general, a direct application of the saddle-point
approximation to these schemes is demonstrated to give incorrect results; this
is not the case for a `semiclassical averaging scheme', for which all loop
corrections vanish identically. As a side product of the dual pair
decomposition, we compute a crossover between the Poisson and CUE ensembles for
omega_U(s).

(not-necessarily-reversible) distance functions on a bounded convex domain in
R^n such that straight lines are shortest paths. Distance functions induced by
a Finsler metric are regarded as smooth ones. Finsler metrics with straight
geodesics said to be projective. It is known that the flag curvature of any
projective Finsler metric is a scalar function of tangent vectors (the flag
curvature must be a constant if it is Riemannian). Thus it is a natural problem
to study those of constant curvature.
  In this paper, we study the Hilbert Fourth Problem in the smooth case. We
first give a formula for x-analytic projective Finsler metrics F(x,y) of
constant curvature K=c using a power series with coefficients expressed in
terms of f(y):=F(0, y), h(y):=(1/2)F(x,y)^{-1}F_{x^k}(0, y)y^k and c. Then, for
any given pair {f(y), h(y)} and any constant c, we give an algebraic formula
for smooth projective Finsler metrics with constant curvature K=c and F(0,
y)=f(y) and F_{x^k}(0, y)y^k=2f(y)h(y). By these formulas, we obtain several
special projective Finsler metrics of constant curvature which can be used as

necessarily of the same degree) in a polynomial ring of n variables. The
Hilbert function for such an ideal is known, thanks to a result of Stanley and
of Watanabe. (For more than n+1 forms the Hilbert function is conjectured by
Froberg.) However, in all but a few trivial cases, the resolution is not known.
A conjecture of Iarrobino says that apart from Koszul syzygies, there should be
no overlaps in the twists occurring in the free modules in the resolution. We
are able to find the precise minimal free resolutions in many cases (depending
on n and on the particular degrees) and give good bounds in many other cases.
As a result, we see that Iarrobino's conjecture does not hold and we begin to
have an understanding of what causes this failure. We conjecture that there are
no such overlaps when all n+1 generators have the same degree. In the process
of achieving these results, we extend a result of Boij by giving the graded
Betti numbers of a generic Gorenstein algebra when n is even and the socle
degree is large.
