density and temperature in the southern sector of the cluster at r=60/h kpc.
The gas inside the edge is 1.3-1.5 times denser and cooler than outside, while
the pressure is continuous, indicating that this is a ""cold front"", the surface
of contact between two moving gases. The continuity of the pressure indicates
that the current relative velocity of the gases is near zero, making the edge
appear to be in hydrostatic equilibrium. However, a total mass profile derived
from the data in this sector under the equilibrium assumption, exhibits an
unphysical jump by a factor of 2, with the mass inside the edge being lower. We
propose that the cooler gas is ""sloshing"" in the cluster gravitational
potential well and is now near the point of maximum displacement, where it has
zero velocity but nonzero centripetal acceleration. The distribution of this
non-hydrostatic gas should reflect the reduced gravity force in the
accelerating reference frame, resulting in the apparent mass discontinuity.
Assuming that the gas outside the edge is hydrostatic, the acceleration of the
moving gas can be estimated from the mass jump, a ~ 800 h km/s/(10^8 yr). The
gravitational potential energy of this gas that is available for dissipation is
about half of its current thermal energy. The length of the cool filament
extending from the cD galaxy (Fabian et al.) may give the amplitude of the gas
sloshing, 30-40/h kpc. Such gas bulk motion might be caused by a disturbance of
the central gravitational potential by past subcluster infall.

long-slit observation centered on the nucleus (PA = 71 deg) using the G430L

clearly favor a model where the gas exists in a partially filled bicone, is
accelerated radially away from the nucleus, and is followed by a constant
deceleration. This geometry and general kinematic model is in agreement with
previous work done on the NLR gas of NGC 1068 and NGC 4151. On scales of

Distribution'' (HOD), which defines the bias of a population of galaxies by the
conditional probability P(N|M) that a dark matter halo of virial mass M
contains N galaxies, together with prescriptions that specify the relative
spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter within halos. By
populating the halos of a cosmological N-body simulation using a variety of HOD
models, we examine the sensitivity of different galaxy clustering statistics to
properties of the HOD. The galaxy correlation function responds to different
aspects of P(N|M) on different scales. Obtaining the observed power-law form of
xi(r) requires rather specific combinations of HOD parameters, implying a
strong constraint on the physics of galaxy formation; the success of numerical
and semi-analytic models in reproducing this form is entirely non-trivial.
Other clustering statistics such as the galaxy-mass correlation function, the
bispectrum, the void probability function, the pairwise velocity dispersion,
and the group multiplicity function are sensitive to different combinations of
HOD parameters and thus provide complementary information about galaxy bias. We
outline a strategy for determining the HOD empirically from redshift survey
data. This method starts from an assumed cosmological model, but we argue that
cosmological and HOD parameters will have non-degenerate effects on galaxy
clustering, so that a substantially incorrect cosmological model will not
reproduce the observations for any choice of HOD. Empirical determinations of
the HOD as a function of galaxy type from the 2dF and SDSS redshift surveys
will provide a detailed target for theories of galaxy formation, insight into
the origin of galaxy properties, and sharper tests of cosmological models.

slower, time scale. Starting from the most simple Gaussian Markov process we
model the exchange between 'slow' and 'fast' environments by treating the

Markov process. The moments of the resulting stochastic process are calculated
from the corresponding Master equations or Langevin equations, depending on the
model. The calculations show the importance of the way to treat exchange
processes. The resulting stochastic process is non-Markovian for all models.
However, the deviations from a Gaussian behavior depend on the details of the
models. A comparison of our results with other model treatments and experiments

nucleate in the patterns when the container acceleration amplitude exceeds a
critical value, about $7g$, where the pattern is approximately hexagonal,
oscillating at one-fourth the driving frequency ($f/4$). A phase bubble is a
localized region that oscillates with a phase opposite (differing by $\pi$) to
that of the surrounding pattern; a localized phase shift is often called an
${\em arching}$ in studies of two-dimensional systems. The simulations show
that the formation of phase bubbles is triggered by undulation at the bottom of
the layer on a large length scale compared to the wavelength of the pattern.
Once formed, a phase bubble shrinks as if it had a surface tension, and
disappears in tens to hundreds of cycles. We find that there is an oscillatory
momentum transfer across a kink, and this shrinking is caused by a net
collisional momentum inward across the boundary enclosing the bubble. At
increasing acceleration amplitudes, the patterns evolve into randomly moving
labyrinthian kinks (spatiotemporal chaos). We observe in the simulations that
$f/3$ and $f/6$ subharmonic patterns emerge as primary instabilities, but that
they are unstable to the undulation of the layer. Our experiments confirm the
existence of transient $f/3$ and $f/6$ patterns.

generalize modular invariance for a given RCFT in the presence of various types
of boundary conditions --open, twisted-- are encoded in a system of integer
multiplicities that form matrix representations of fusion-like algebras. These
multiplicities are also the combinatorial data that enable one to construct an
abstract ``quantum'' algebra, whose $6j$- and $3j$-symbols contain essential
information on the Operator Product Algebra of the RCFT and are part of a cell

Standard Model (MSSM) spectrum is addressed. States beyond those contained in
the MSSM and nonstandard hypercharge normalization are shown to be generic,
though some models do allow for the usual hypercharge normalization found in
SU(5) embeddings of the Standard Model gauge group. The minimum value of the
hypercharge normalization consistent with accomodation of the MSSM is
determined for each model. In some cases, the normalization can be smaller than
that corresponding to an SU(5) embedding of the Standard Model gauge group,
similar to what has been found in free fermionic models. Bizzare hypercharges
typically occur for exotic states, allowing for matter which does not occur in
the decomposition of SU(5) representations---a result which has been noted many
times before in four-dimensional string models. Only one of the twenty patterns
of representations, comprising seven of the 175 models, is found to be without
an anomalous U(1). The sizes of nonvanishing vacuum expectation values induced
by the anomalous U(1) are studied. It is found that large radius moduli
stabilization may lead to the breakdown of sigma-model perturbativity. Various
quantities of interest in effective supergravity model building are tabulated
for the set of 175 models. In particular, it is found that string moduli masses
appear to be generically quite near the gravitino mass. String scale gauge
coupling unification is shown to be possible, albeit contrived, in an example
model. The intermediate scales of exotic particles are estimated and the degree
of fine-tuning is studied.

analyze the effects of decoherence and non-ideal beam splitters. It is shown
that under realistic experimental conditions the Bell inequalities are violated
by more than 30 standard deviations.

renormalized expansions for the sextic anharmonic oscillator are considered.

the quantum (many-body) energy levels. Applying the two-mode approximation to
the bosonic field operators, we show that the quantum energy levels create an
anti-crossing net inside the region bounded by the loop of the mean field
solution.

zero-point energy induced by a specific boundary condition for the spatial
configuration. In terms of the imaginary-time formalism at finite temperature,
the root of Planck's law of radiation can be traced back to finite modification
of the infinite vacuum energy induced by the periodic boundary condition in the
temporal direction. We give the explicit conversion from the Casimir force to
Planck's law of radiation, which shows the apparent correspondence between the
system bounded by parallel conducting plates and the thermodynamic system. The
temperature inversion symmetry and the duality relation in the thermodynamics
are also discussed. We conclude that the effective temperature characterized by
the spatial extension should no longer be regarded as genuine temperature.

constituents, can be represented and studied by different algebras of
observables or operators. For example, a fully polarized electronic system can
be investigated by means of the algebra generated by the usual fermionic
creation and annihilation operators, or by using the algebra of Pauli
(spin-1/2) operators. The correspondence between the two algebras is given by
the Jordan-Wigner isomorphism. As we previously noted similar one-to-one
mappings enable one to represent any physical system in a quantum computer. In
this paper we evolve and exploit this fundamental concept in quantum
information processing to simulate generic physical phenomena by quantum
networks. We give quantum circuits useful for the efficient evaluation of the
physical properties (e.g, spectrum of observables or relevant correlation
functions) of an arbitrary system with Hamiltonian $H$.

is explicitly shown that the precession time is equal to the dwell time in both
the nonrelativistic and relativistic cases. We also present a numerical
estimation of the precession time showing an apparent superluminal tunneling.
