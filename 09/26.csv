below the filtering length. Remarkably, WDM as well as CDM halos are
well-described by the two-parameter angular momentum profile of Bullock et al.

Although the best-fit shape parameters change quantitatively for individual
halos in the two simulations, we find no systematic variation in profile shapes
as a function of the dark matter type. The scatter in shape parameters is
significantly smaller for the WDM halos, suggesting that substructure and/or
merging history plays a role producing scatter about the mean angular momentum
distribution, but that the average angular momentum profiles of halos originate
from larger-scale phenomena or a mechanism associated with the virialization
process. The known mismatch between the angular momentum distributions of dark
halos and disk galaxies is therefore present in WDM as well as CDM models. Our
WDM halos tend to have a less coherent (more misaligned) angular momentum
structure and smaller spin parameters than do their CDM counterparts, although
we caution that this result is based on a small number of halos.

slowly rising rotation law. We are able to rule out both a mass-follows-light

from the distribution function and corrected for observational errors and the

interval 0<z<4.5 in the HDF-S. The HST optical data are combined with infrared
ISAAC/VLT observations, and photometric redshifts are used for all the galaxies
brighter than I_AB<27.5. The clustering signal is obtained in different
redshift bins using two different approaches: a standard one, which uses the
best redshift estimate of each object, and a second one, which takes into
account the redshift probability function of each object. This second method
makes it possible to improve the information in the redshift intervals where
contamination from objects with insecure redshifts is important. With both
methods, we find that the clustering strength up to z~3.5 in the HDF-S is
consistent with the previous results in the HDF-N. While at redshift lower than
z~1 the HDF galaxy population is un/anti-biased (b<1) with respect to the
underlying dark matter, at high redshift the bias increases up to b~2-3,
depending on the cosmological model. These results support previous claims
that, at high redshift, galaxies are preferentially located in massive haloes,
as predicted by the biased galaxy formation scenario. The impact of cosmic
errors on our analyses has been quantified, showing that errors in the
clustering measurements in the HDF surveys are indeed dominated by shot-noise
in most regimes. Future observations with instruments like the ACS on HST will
improve the S/N by at least a factor of two and more detailed analyses of the
errors will be required. In fact, pure shot-noise will give a smaller
contribution with respect to other sources of errors, such as finite volume
effects or non-Poissonian discreteness effects.

answer these questions, we quantify cluster substructure using a set of
morphological order parameters constructed on the basis of the Minkowski

cluster parameters: in certain spaces of such parameters fundamental band-like
structures are forming indicating the emergence of a virial equilibrium. We

obtains particularly high grasp (effective area--solid angle product) at lower
particle energies, where conventional schemes are most limited in their
utility. The concept is simple and lightweight, so it can be readily employed
on balloon and space-based missions. An extremely powerful potential
application of GAPS is a space-based search for the neutralino through the
detection of a neutralino annihilation by-product -- the antideuteron.
Paradoxically, this space-based search for the neutralino is capable of
achieving comparable sensitivity to as yet unrealized third generation,
underground dark matter experiments. And GAPS can obtain this performance in a
very modest satellite experiment. GAPS can also provide superior performance in
searches for primary antiprotons produced via neutralino annihilation, black
hole evaporation and in probing subdominant contributions to the antiproton
flux at low energies. In a deep space mission GAPS will obtain higher
sensitivity for a given weight and power than BGO calorimeters.

quantify the lens amplification and thus correct the observed number counts and
survey area for the effects of gravitational lensing. After making these
corrections, we estimate surface densities at K<=21.6 of 2.5+/-0.4 and
1.2+/-0.3 arcmin^-2 for EROs with R-K>=5.3 and 6.0 respectively. These ERO
number counts agree with previous shallower surveys at K<~19 and flatten
significantly at magnitudes fainter than K~19-20. This flattening may be due to
a transition from an ERO population dominated by evolved galaxies at z~1-2
(K<~19.5) to one dominated by dusty starburst galaxies at z>1 (K>~19.5). We
also compare our results with various model predictions, including a model that
attempts to explain EROs in terms of a single population of elliptical galaxies
formed at high redshift. We find that a formation epoch of z_f~2.5 for this
population matches the observed surface density of R-K>=5.3 EROs quite well,
and the R-K>=6.0 sample less well. More sophisticated models, including
semi-analytic prescriptions, under-predict the ERO surface density by
approximately an order of magnitude, suggesting that these models produce

discovered by the MACHO Collaboration during a 7 year survey of the Galactic

due, in part, to accurate photometric data from the GMAN and MPS
collaborations. The microlensing parallax fit parameters are used in a
likelihood analysis, which is able to estimate the distance and masses of the
lens objects based upon a standard model of the Galactic velocity distribution.
This analysis indicates that the most likely masses of 5 of the 6 lenses are >
1 Msun, which suggests that a substantial fraction of the Galactic lenses may
be massive stellar remnants. This could explain the observed excess of long
timescale microlensing events. The lenses for events MACHO-96-BLG-5 and
MACHO-98-BLG-6 are the most massive, with mass estimates of M/Msun = 6 +10/-3
and M/Msun = 6 +7/-3, respectively. The observed upper limits on the absolute
brightness of main sequence stars for these lenses are < 1 Lsun, so both lenses
are black hole candidates. The black hole interpretation is also favored by a
likelihood analysis with a Bayesian prior using a conventional model for the
lens mass function. We consider the possibility that the source stars for some
of these 6 events may lie in the foreground or background of the Galactic
bulge, but we find that this is unlikely. Future HST observations of these
events can either confirm the black hole lens hypothesis or detect the lens
stars and provide a direct measurement of their masses. Future observations of
similar events by SIM or the Keck or VLTI interferometers will allow direct
measurements of the lens masses for stellar remnant lenses as well.

a broad, unstructured band of light in the 540 to 950 nm wavelength range,
referred to as Extended Red Emission (ERE). The presence of interstellar dust
and ultraviolet photons are two necessary conditions for ERE to occur. This is
the basis for suggestions which attribute ERE to an interstellar dust component
capable of photoluminescence. In this study, we have collected all published
ERE observations with absolute-calibrated spectra for interstellar
environments, where the density of ultraviolet photons can be estimated
reliably. In each case, we determined the band-integrated ERE intensity, the
wavelength of peak emission in the ERE band, and the efficiency with which
absorbed ultraviolet photons are contributing to the ERE. The data show that
radiation is not only driving the ERE, as expected for a photoluminescence
process, but is modifying the ERE carrier as manifested by a systematic
increase in the ERE band's peak wavelength and a general decrease in the photon
conversion efficiency with increasing densities of the prevailing exciting
radiation. The overall spectral characteristics of the ERE and the observed
high quantum efficiency of the ERE process are currently best matched by the
recently proposed silicon nanoparticle (SNP) model. Using the experimentally
established fact that ionization of semiconductor nanoparticles quenches their
photoluminescence, we proceeded to test the SNP model by developing a
quantitative model for the excitation and ionization equilibrium of SNPs under
interstellar conditions for a wide range of radiation field densities.

The outburst peak and early decline spectra of SS Cyg are well fit by models of
a steady-state accretion disk and a biconical wind. A broad, blueshifted OVI
wind-formed absorption line is the only strong spectral feature. In late
outburst decline, OVI and CIII lines are seen as broad emission features and
the continuum has flattened. In U Gem, the continua of the optical outburst
plateau spectra are plausibly fit by accretion disk model spectra. The spectra
also show numerous narrow, low-velocity absorption lines that do not originate
in the inner accretion disk. We discuss the line spectra in the context of
partial absorption of the FUV continuum by low-velocity, vertically-extended
material located at large disk radii. The late outburst decline spectrum of U
Gem is dominated by the white dwarf. WD model fits confirm the sub-solar C and
super-solar N abundances found in earlier studies.

contributions to decoherence and energy shifts due to the tunnel coupling. We
give a detailed analysis of sequential and co-tunneling currents, for linearly
and circularly oscillating ESR fields, applied in cw and pulsed mode. We show
that the sequential tunneling current exhibits a spin satellite peak whose
linewidth gives a lower bound on the decoherence time T_2 of the dot-spin.
Similarly, the spin decoherence can be accessed also in the cotunneling regime
via ESR induced spin flips. We show that the conductance ratio of the spin
satellite peak and the conventional peak due to sequential tunneling saturates
at the universal conductance ratio of 0.71 for strong ESR fields. We describe a
double-dot setup which generates spin dependent tunneling and acts as a current
pump (at zero bias), and as a spin inverter which inverts the spin-polarization
of the current. We show that Rabi oscillations of the dot-spin induce coherent
oscillations in the time-dependent current. These oscillations are observable
in the time-averaged current as function of ESR pulse-duration, and they allow
one to access the spin coherence directly in the time domain. We analyze the

five dimensions (community of interest, customer scope, directionality, pricing

boundaries for definition can generate gross inequities in rural Internet

geographically restricted infrastructure investments, curtail service provision
in remote areas. A statistical analysis of 1300 telephone exchanges, including

to customers in Europe. This contrasts with various complaints that retail
prices of roaming calls are rigid and excessive. The focus if the paper is on
wholesale roaming, which is the prime determinant of retail roaming prices. The
paper analyses the structural conditions of wholesale roaming markets that have
impaired incentives to competition, namely high combined market share of the
two leading GSM 900 operators combined with second mover disadvantages for new
entrant GSM 1800 operators, and demand externalities. The paper argues that a
number of developments are under way that are likely to modify this situation
in the future. With the introduction of SIM over-the-air programming, home
mobile operators will be able to direct customers to networks with the lowest
charges. As dual mode handsets become ubiquitous and as new entrant GSM 1800
operators reach nationwide coverage, second-mover disadvantages will disappear.
Given the relatively small roaming volumes that GSM 1800 operators currently
provide, they should have an incentive to lower charges in exchange for
preferred roaming status. On the demand side of wholesale roaming markets, it
will be the larger GSM 900 operators, and in particular those with a
pan-European footprint, that will ask for lower charges in exchange for
preferred roaming status. This could discriminate against mobile operators in
downstream retail markets that do not have a pan-European footprint and that
lack the bargaining power. However, arbitrage by roaming brokers, new entry and
wider geographical markets on the retail roaming level will work against this.

has a similar structure, taking the form of a (anisotropic and rotating) de
Sitter-like core surrounded by a rotating elliptic shell. The Kerr singular
ring is regularized by anisotropic matter rotating in the equatorial plane, so
that the negative sheet of the Kerr geometry is absent. In the charged case the
sources take the form of ``bags'', which can have de Sitter or anti de Sitter
interiors and a smooth domain wall boundary, with a tangential stress providing
charge confinement. The ADM and Tolman relations are used to calculate the

rises as fast as $(\sqrt{s}/M_f)^{2+\delta}$, where $M_f$ is the fundamental
scale of gravity in $4+\delta$ dimensions, and that the distribution of
radiating a fraction $y$ of the initial particle's energy into gravitational
energy (which goes undetected) behaves as $\delta y^{\delta -1}$. The missing
energy leads to an underestimate of the true energy and generates a break in

pion scattering from the three-nucleon system in terms of single- and

Reasonable agreement between our theoretical calculations and the experimental

found that the Delta-mass splitting and the internal Coulomb interaction are
the most important contributions for CSV in the three-nucleon system. The CSV
effects are rather sensitive to the choice of pion-nuclear scattering
mechanisms, but at the same time, our theoretical predictions are much less
sensitive to the choice of the nuclear wave function. It is found, however,

isoscalar mean field by the stronger repuslive neutron symmetry potential in
the more neutron-rich matter. Moreover, it is shown that the isospin
fractionation happens later, but grows faster in the more neutron-rich matter.
Implications of these results to current experiments exploring properties of
neutron-rich matter are discussed.

four 96 mass systems $^{96}Ru+^{96}Ru$, $^{96}Ru+^{96}Zr$,
  $^{96}Zr+^{96}Ru$, $^{96}Zr+^{96}Zr$ at 100 AMeV and 400 AMeV with isospin
dependent QMD.
  We propose that the neutron-proton differential rapidity distribution is a
sensitive probe to the degree of equilibration with respect to the isospin
degree of freedom. By analyzing the average $N/Z$ ratio of emitted nucleons,
light charged particles (LCP) and intermediate mass fragments (IMF), it is
found that there exist memory effect in multifragmentation process. The average
$N/Z$ ratio of IMF reduces largely as beam energy increases from 100 AMeV to
400 AMeV which may result from the change of the behavior of the isotope
distribution of IMF charges. The isotope distribution of IMF charges does also
show certain memory effect at 100 AMeV case but not at 400 AMeV case.

possibilities in only sqrt(N) steps. This paper gives a fresh perspective on
the algorithm in terms of a resonance phenomenon which is implemented through
classical coupled oscillators. Consider N oscillators, one of which is of a
different resonant frequency. We could identify which one this is by measuring
the oscillation frequency of each oscillator, a procedure that would take about
N cycles. We show how, by coupling the oscillators together in a very simple
way, it is possible to identify the different one in only sqrt(N) cycles. An
extension of this technique to the quantum case leads to the quantum search
algorithm.
