We determine young star properties as the consequence of the parent cloud
evolution. Mass, luminosity and effective temperature in the first million
years of the proto-Sun result from gravitational fragmentation of a molecular
cloud region that produces a cluster of prestellar clumps. We calculate the
global dynamical behavior of the cloud using isothermal 3D hydrodynamics and
follow the evolution of individual protostars in detail using a 1D
radiation-fluid-dynamic system of equations that comprises a correct standard
solar model solution, as a limiting case. We calculate the pre-main sequence
(PMS) evolutionary tracks of a solar mass star in a dense stellar cluster
environment and compare it to one that forms in isolation. Up to an age of
950.000 years differences in the accretion history lead to significantly
different temperature and luminosity evolution. As accretion fades and the
stars approach their final masses the two dynamic PMS tracks converge. After
that the contraction of the quasi-hydrostatic stellar interiors dominate the
overall stellar properties and proceed in very similar ways. Hence the position
of a star in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram becomes a function of age and mass
only. However, our quantitative description of cloud fragmentation, star
formation and early stellar evolution predicts substantial corrections to the
classical, i.e. hydrostatic and initially fully convective models: At an age of
1 million years the proto-Sun is twice as bright and 500 Kelvin hotter than

to produce strong, broad UV emission lines in low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs).
However, detailed photoionization calculations show that this mechanism fails
to produce sufficient emission measure. We present the results of
hydrodynamical calculations of the disk photosphere irradiated by strong
X-rays. We attempt to determine whether LMXBs can harbor significant UV-driven
disk winds despite the effects of X-ray ionization. Such winds would be a
likely candidate for the site of emission of UV lines and may better explain
the observations than the X-ray heated disk photosphere. We find that the local
disk radiation cannot launch a wind from the disk because of strong ionizing
radiation from the central object. Unphysically high X-ray opacities would be
required to shield the UV emitting disk and allow the line force to drive a
disk wind. However the same X-ray radiation that inhibits line driving heats
the disk and can produce a hot bipolar wind or corona above the disk. To assess
the impact of X-ray heating upon driving of a disk wind by the line force in
any system with an accretion disk we derive analytic formulae. In particular,
we compare results of line-driven disk wind models for accretion disks in LMXBs
and active galactic nuclei. The latter show spectral features associated with a
strong and fast disk wind. The key parameter determining the role of the line
force is not merely the presence of the luminous UV zone in the disk and the
presence of the X-rays, but also the distance of this UV zone from the center.

tesla. The resistivity is moderately anisotropic, with a room-temperature
c-axis to in-plane resistivity ratio rho_c/rho_a(300 K) = 1.7. rho(T)
measurements on the non-magnetic analog LaRhIn5 indicate that the anisotropy in
the CeRhIn5 resistivity stems predominately from anisotropy in Kondo-derived
magnetic scattering. In the magnetically ordered regime an applied field H
reduces TN only slightly due to the small ordered moment (0.37mu_B) and
magnetic anisotropy. The magnetoresistance (MR) below TN is positive and varies
linearly with H. In the paramagnetic state a positive MR is present below 7.5
K, while a high-field negative contribution is evident at higher temperatures.
The positive contribution decreases in magnitude with increasing temperature.
Above 40 K the positive contribution is no longer observable, and the MR is
negative. The low-T positive MR results from interactions with the
Kondo-coherent state, while the high-T negative MR stems from single-impurity
effects. The H and T-dependent magnetotransport reflects the magnetic
anisotropy and Kondo interactions at play in CeRhIn5.

contrast between the microphases is allowed through a linear dependence of the

viscosity contrast does not affect the composition of the base lamellar phase
in an unbounded geometry, and that it only couples weakly to long wavelength
perturbations. A perturbative analysis is then presented to address the
stability of uniform lamellar structures under long wavelength perturbations by
self-consistently solving for the composition and velocity fields of the
perturbations. Stability boundaries are obtained as functions of the physical
parameters of the polymer, the parameters of the flow and the initial
orientation of the lamellae. We find that all orientations are linearly stable
within specific ranges of parameters, but that the perpendicular orientation is
generally stable within a larger range than the parallel orientation. Secondary
instabilities are both of the Eckhaus type (longitudinal) and zig-zag type

instability threshold. It is shown that in the long time limit the flow behaves
as an incompressible fluid, regardless of the value of the Reynolds number.
This is not the case for the short time behavior where the incompressibility
assumption leads in general to a wrong form of the static correlation
functions, except near the instability threshold. The theoretical predictions
are confirmed by numerical simulations of the full nonlinear fluctuating
hydrodynamic equations.

been studied, using the formalism of fluctuating hydrodynamics. In this paper
the nonlinear regime is considered, with emphasis on the statistical properties
of the flow near the first instability. The normal form amplitude equation is
derived for the case of an incompressible fluid and the velocity field is
constructed explicitly above (but closed to) the instability. The relative
simplicity of this flow allows one to analyze the compressible case as well.
Using a perturbative technique, it is shown that close to the instability
threshold the stochastic dynamics of the system is governed by two coupled non
linear Langevin equations in the Fourier space. The solution of these equations
can becast into the exponential of a Landau Ginzburg functional, which proves
to be identical to the one obtained for the case of the incompressible fluid.

taking into account a spatial boundary, it is necessary to modify the standard

on the spatial boundary conditions for the gravitational field. The most
general mathematically allowed boundary conditions and corresponding boundary

the symplectic current pulled back to the hypersurface boundary of the

several results developed in recent literature for General Relativity. As an
illustration of the method, we apply it to the Maxwell field equations to

structure of General Relativity for spatially bounded regions of spacetime. To
allow for near complete generality, the Hamiltonian is formulated using any
fixed hypersurface, with a boundary given by a closed spacelike 2-surface. A
main result is that we obtain Hamiltonians associated to Dirichlet and Neumann
boundary conditions on the gravitational field coupled to matter sources, in
particular a Klein-Gordon field, an electromagnetic field, and a set of
Yang-Mills-Higgs fields. The Hamiltonians are given by a covariant form of the
Arnowitt-Deser-Misner Hamiltonian modified by a surface integral term that
depends on the particular boundary conditions. The general form of this surface
integral involves an underlying ``energy-momentum'' vector in the spacetime
tangent space at the spatial boundary 2-surface. We give examples of the
resulting Dirichlet and Neumann vectors for topologically spherical 2-surfaces
in Minkowski spacetime, spherically symmetric spacetimes, and stationary
axisymmetric spacetimes. Moreover, we show the relation between these vectors
and the ADM energy-momentum vector for a 2-surface taken in a limit to be
spatial infinity in asymptotically flat spacetimes. We also discuss the
geometrical properties of the Dirichlet and Neumann vectors and obtain several
striking results relating these vectors to the mean curvature and normal
curvature connection of the 2-surface. Most significantly, the part of the
Dirichlet vector normal to the 2-surface depends only the spacetime metric at
this surface and thereby defines a geometrical normal vector field on the
2-surface. Properties and examples of this normal vector are discussed.

but at present we do not have access to the full densities from which a higher
order expansion can be determined. The present results contradict those of Kwon
et al., J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 113}, 6469 (2000), who predicted that the

satellite-borne experiment. The physics goals of the experiment are the
measurement of the flux of antiprotons, positrons and light isotopes in the
cosmic radiation.
  The calorimeter is designed to perform a precise measurement of the total
energy deposited, to reconstruct the spatial development of the showers (both
in the longitudinal and in the transverse directions), and to measure the
energy distribution along the shower itself. From this information, the
calorimeter will identify antiprotons from a electron background and positrons
in a background of protons with an efficiency of about 95% and a rejection
power better than 10^-4. Furthermore, a self-trigger system has been
implemented with the calorimeter that will be employed to measure high-energy
(from about 300 GeV to more than 1 TeV) electrons.
  The instrument is composed of 22 layers of tungsten, each sandwiched between
two ""views"" of silicon strip detectors (X and Y). The signals are read out by a
custom VLSI front-end chip, the CR1.4P, specifically designed for the PAMELA
calorimeter, with a dynamic range of 7.14 pC or 1400 mip (minimum ionizing
particle).
  We report on the simulated performance and prototype design.

electron transfer) is studied. One reaction coordinate is used to model this

internal degrees of freedom of the adsorbed molecule as well as possibly a
liquid surrounding the molecule provide a dissipative environment, which may
lead to dephasing, relaxation, and sometimes excitation of the relevant system.
In the process studied the adsorbed molecule is excited by a light pulse. This
is followed by an electron transfer from the excited donor state to the
quasi-continuum of the substrate. It is assumed that the substrate is a
semiconductor. The effects of dissipation on electron injection are
investigated.

slit each particle passes through and still observe an interference pattern in

It is found that the internal freedoms like electronic states of an atom can be
used to detect the which-path information of each atom while uphold the
interference pattern of atoms when the center-of-mass motion of atoms is

us to rederive the DMRG in a physically transparent way. Motivated by our
reinterpretation we suggest a modification of the DMRG which manifestly takes
account of the entanglement in a quantum system. This modified renormalization
scheme is shown,in certain special cases, to preserve more entanglement in a
quantum system than traditional numerical renormalization methods.
