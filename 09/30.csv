imaged in the near-infrared by the 3.58-m New Technology Telescope and in the
optical by the 1.54-m Danish Telescope ~8 hr after the gamma-ray event. Here we
implement the colour-colour discrimination technique proposed by Rhoads (2001)
and extend it using near-IR data as well. We present the results provided by an
automatic colour-colour discrimination pipe-line developed to discern the
different populations of objects present in the GRB 001011 error box. Our
software revealed three candidates based on single-epoch images. Second-epoch
observations carried out ~3.2 days after the burst revealed that the most
likely candidate had faded, thus identifying it with the counterpart to the
GRB. In deep R-band images obtained 7 months after the burst a faint
(R=25.38+/-0.25) elongated object, presumably the host galaxy of GRB 001011,
was detected at the position of the afterglow. The GRB 001011 afterglow is the
first discovered with the assistance of colour-colour diagram techniques. We
discuss the advantages of using this method and its application to error boxes
determined by future missions.

color gradients in early-type galaxies reported in the Hubble Deep Field North
and South (HDFs) by Menanteau, Abraham & Ellis 2001. We use a multi-zone single
collapse model. This model accounts for the observed blue cores by adopting a
broad spread in formation redshifts for ellipticals, allowing some of these
galaxies begin forming no more than ~1 Gyr before the redshift of observation.
The single-zone collapse model then produces cores that are bluer than the
outer regions because of the increase of the local potential well toward the
center which makes star-formation more extended in the central region of the
galaxy. We compare the predicted V-I(r) color gradients with the observed ones
using the redshift of formation ($z_F$) of the elliptical as the only free
parameter. We find that the model can account with relatively good agreement
for the blue cores and inverse color gradients found in many spheroidals and at
the same time for the red and smooth colors profiles reported. Based on the
model our analysis suggests two populations of field ellipticals, one formed
recently, within $\lesssim1$Gyr and another much older formed $\gtrsim4$Gyr
since the redshift of observation.

Template spectral energy distributions are fit to the multiband photometry
between visible and near-infrared wavelengths to derive a better constraint on
the stellar mass of these galaxies. The internal extinction in the host
galaxies is estimated using the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) slope. We find that
the extinction corrected star-formation rates (SFRs) of the galaxies are
significantly larger than rates derived from emission lines in the visible or
the UV continuum. The ratio between the extinction corrected SFRs and stellar
mass for 7 of the host galaxies is high compared to local starbursts and 3 of
the hosts have derived far-infrared luminosities comparable to infrared
luminous galaxies. In addition, existing observational data reveal that at
least 6 of the 11 putative hosts seem to be disturbed or have companion
galaxies within a projected angular separation of about 2.5 arcsec. If we
assume that the host and the companion are at similar redshifts, this
corresponds to a physical separation of less than 20 kpc, providing some
evidence for an ongoing/recent tidal encounter. We conclude that
tidally-induced starbursts such as those found in infrared luminous galaxies
might be popular birthplaces for gamma-ray bursts. The age of the stellar
population in 4 out of 6 galaxies is rather young, of order 10 Myr. This favors
models where gamma-ray bursts are due to the core-collapse of isolated, massive
stars and explosion of the resultant black hole-accretion disk system.

By considering suitable diamond or necklace hierarchical lattices, and assuming

parameter space. The analysis of stability of the fixed points leads to an
exact criterion to gauge the relevance of geometric fluctuations. For
irrelevant fluctuations, the critical behavior remains unchanged with respect
to the uniform systems. For relevant fluctuations, there appears a two-cycle of
saddle-point character in parameter space. A scaling analysis, supported by
direct numerical thermodynamic calculations, shows the existence of novel
critical universality classes associated with relevant geometric fluctuations.
Also, we show that similar qualitative results are displayed by a simple model
of two directed polymers on a diamond hierarchical structure with aperiodic

space-time dimensions. The long wavelength physics is determined by a
non-trivial fixed point of the renormalization group. At the critical point we
find that the dispersion relation and width of quasiparticles of momentum $p$
is $\omega_p \sim p^{z}$ and $\Gamma_p \sim (z-1) \omega_p$ respectively, the
group velocity of quasiparticles $v_g \sim p^{z-1}$ vanishes in the long
wavelength limit at the critical point. Away from the critical point for
$T\gtrsim T_c$ we find $\omega_p \sim \xi^{-z}[1+(p \xi)^{2z}]^{{1/2}}$ and
$\Gamma_p \sim (z-1) \omega_p \frac{(p \xi)^{2z}}{1+(p \xi)^{2z}}$ with $\xi$
the finite temperature correlation length $ \xi \propto |T-T_c|^{-\nu}$. The
new \emph{dynamical} exponent $z$ results from anisotropic renormalization in

i.e, a vanishing width in the long-wavelength limit, and the validity of the

  M. Biesiada to appear in Acta Physica Polonica B). It is an abridged
  streamlined version of one of my Erice (2001) lectures, gr-qc/0107049","Acta Phys.Polon.B32:3555-3570,2001",,,"quant-ph gr-qc hep-th",,"  After reviewing the relation of entropy to information, I derive the entropy
bound as applied to bounded weakly gravitating systems, and review the bound's
applications to cosmology as well as its extensions to higher dimensions. I
then discuss why black holes behave as 1-D objects when emitting entropy, which
suggests that a black hole swallows information at a rate restricted by the
one-channel information capacity. I discuss fundamental limitations on the
information borne by signal pulses in curved spacetime, from which I verify the
mentioned bound on the rate of information disposal by a black hole.
