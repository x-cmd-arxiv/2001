source is associated with AC211, the previously identified optical counterpart
to 4U2127+119, a low mass X-ray binary (LMXB). The second source, M15-X2, is
coincident with a 19th U magnitude blue star that is 3.3"" from the cluster
core. The Chandra count rate of M15-X2 is 2.5 times higher than that of AC211.
Prior to the 0.5"" imaging capability of Chandra the presence of two so closely
separated bright sources would not have been resolved. The optical counterpart,
X-ray luminosity and spectrum of M15-X2 are consistent with it also being an
LMXB system. This is the first time that two LMXBs have been seen to be
simultaneously active in a globular cluster. The discovery of a second active
LMXB in M15 solves a long standing puzzle where the properties of AC211 appear
consistent with it being dominated by an extended accretion disk corona, and
yet 4U2127+119 also shows luminous X-ray bursts requiring that the neutron star
be directly visible. The resolution of 4U2127+119 into two sources suggests
that the X-ray bursts did not come from AC211, but rather from M15-X2. We
discuss the implications of this discovery for understanding the origin and

increases monotonically through most of the M, L, and T subclasses, but it is
approximately constant between types L6 and T5, due to the onset of methane
absorption at the blue edge of the L' bandpass. The JHK colors of L dwarfs show
significant scatter, suggesting variations in the amount and properties of
photospheric dust, and indicating that it may not be possible to associate a
unique effective temperature with a given L spectral type. The H-K colors of

(power-law slope ~-3.5). The torque noise power levels are consistent with some
accreting systems on time scales of ~1 year, yet the full power spectrum is
much steeper in frequency than any known accreting source. To the best of our
knowledge, torque noise power spectra with a comparably steep frequency
dependence have only been seen in young, glitching radio pulsars (e.g. Vela).
The observed changes in spin-down rate do not correlate with burst activity,
therefore, the physical mechanisms behind each phenomenon are also likely

product, i.e., the thermal gas pressure divided by the Boltzmann constant k. In
neutral gas, the relative populations of neutral carbon atoms in the excited

picture of the distribution function for thermal pressures in H I regions is

library. Freed from any significant dependence on theory, we are able to
perform a fundamental test of the adequacy of the spectral library and its
associated stellar parameters. Excellent fits are achieved for almost all
absorption-line indices studied, provided the computations are corrected for
two limitations of the spectral library, namely, the lack of a representative
set of metal-poor giants and the absence of CN-strong stars. The latter effect
is corrected by means of spectrum synthesis from model photospheres,
considering the abundance pattern of CN-strong and CN-normal stars. We also
need to perform a slight correction of the metallicity of the cluster (by
--0.05 dex in relation to the standard value [Fe/H]=-0.7) in order to match the
metal-line index measurements in the cluster spectrum. After these relatively
small adjustments, the overall spectral agreement is good. Good fits are
achieved for Hbeta, Hgamma, Mgb, <Fe>, Ca4227 and Fe4383, and only Hdelta_F is
overpredicted. Thus, ages inferred from Hdelta_F are slightly older than the
ages based on the other Balmer lines, by ~ 3 Gyrs. The success of this exercise

theoretical isochrones from M. Salaris and the most recent set from the Padova
group, and new semi-empirical calibrations between fundamental stellar
parameters and observables. We highlight the importance of correctly modeling
the luminosity function (LF) of the cluster at the level of the giant branch,
in order to achieve a good reproduction of the integrated spectrum; agreement
between the spectroscopic age and the age based on the cluster's
color-magnitude diagram (CMD) is achieved only if the observed LF is used
rather than the theoretical ones, which either do not include AGB stars
(Salaris) or underpredict the total number counts of bright giants in the
cluster by a factor of two(Padova). After all corrections are made, the CMD and
the spectroscopic ages (from Hgamma and Hbeta) are in close agreement: 11--12
Gyrs for Salaris isochrones and about 13 Gyrs for Padova. The difference
between the model ages is due to the inclusion of atomic diffusion in the
Salaris models. Previously older spectroscopic ages were due to the
underestimate of the number of red giants and/or the use of isochrones that
neglected the effects of He-diffusion and alpha-enhancement. A similar
underestimate in the bright giant LF, if it exists in current super-solar
metallicity models, would cause spectroscopic ages of elliptical galaxies
inferred from such models to be too high by approximately 30%.

to the Hyades) open star cluster NGC 2099 (M37). The V, B-V color-magnitude
diagram (CMD) for the cluster shows an extremely well populated and very
tightly constrained main-sequence extending over 12 magnitudes from the
turn-off. The CFH12K photometry for this cluster is faint enough (V ~ 24.5) to
detect the remnants of the most massive progenitor cluster stars under the Type
I SNe limit. Therefore, the CMD of the cluster also exhibits a well defined
white dwarf `clump' caused by the decreased rate of cooling of these stars as
they age, and a subsequent gap with very few objects. The termination point (Mv
= 11.95 +/- 0.30) of the white dwarf luminosity function gives a white dwarf
cooling age of 566 +/- 154/176 Myrs which is in excellent agreement with the
main-sequence turn-off isochrone age (520 Myrs). By carefully accounting for
errors, we show that the cooling age confirms that models including convective
core overshooting are preferred for young-intermediate aged clusters. We also
derive the reddening (E(B-V) = 0.21 +/- 0.03) and distance ((m-M)v = 11.55 +/-
0.13) to NGC 2099 by matching main-sequence features in the cluster to a new
fiducial main-sequence for the Hyades. As a continuing part of the goals of the
CFHT Open Star Cluster Survey to better understand dynamical processes of open
clusters, we also fit a King model to the cluster density distribution and
investigate the cluster main-sequence luminosity and mass functions in
increasing concentric annuli. We find some evidence for mass segregation within
the boundary of NGC 2099 as expected given the cluster's age relative to the
dynamical age. The present global mass function for the cluster is found to be
shallower than a Salpeter IMF.

light bundles from distant galaxies are deflected and distorted by the tidal

through the Universe. Two-point statistical measures of the observed
ellipticities, like the dispersion within a finite aperture or the ellipticity
cross-correlation, can be related to the power spectrum of the large-scale
structure. The measurement of cosmic shear (especially on small angular scales)
can thus be used to constrain cosmological parameters and to test cosmological
structure formation in the non-linear regime, without any assumptions about the
relation between luminous and dark matter. In this paper we will present
preliminary cosmic shear measurements on sub-arcminute scales, obtained from
archival STIS parallel data. The high angular resolution of HST, together with
the sensitivity and PSF-stability of STIS, allows us to measure cosmic shear
along many independent lines-of-sight. Ongoing STIS parallel observations,
currently being carried out in the frame of a big GO program (8562+9248), will
greatly increase the number of available useful fields and will enable us to
measure cosmic shear with higher accuracy on sub-arcminute scales.

explaining the mass-density relation shown by haloes in high-resolution

accretion, thereby allowing a natural definition of halo formation and
destruction. This makes it possible to derive analytic expressions for halo
formation and destruction rates, the mass accretion rate, and the probability
distribution functions of halo formation times and progenitor masses. The
stochastic merger histories of haloes can be readily derived and easily
incorporated into semi-analytical models of galaxy formation, thus avoiding the
usual problems encountered in the construction of Monte Carlo merger trees from
the original extended Press-Schechter formalism. Here we show that the
predictions of the modified Press-Schechter model are in good agreement with
the results of N-body simulations for several scale-free cosmologies.

from those of both present-day protostars and primordial zero-age main sequence
stars. After an initial expansion of the radius (for < 12 Msun), the protostar
undergoes an extended phase of contraction (up to 60 Msun). The stellar surface
is not visible throughout most of the main accretion phase, since a photosphere
is formed in the infalling envelope. Also, significant nuclear burning does not
take place until a protostellar mass of about 80 Msun. As the interior
luminosity approaches the Eddington luminosity, the protostellar radius rapidly
expands, reaching a maximum around 100 Msun. Changes in the ionization of the
surface layers induce a secondary phase of contraction, followed by a final
swelling due to radiation pressure when the stellar mass reaches about 300
Msun. This expansion is likely to signal the end of the main accretion phase,

values of global cosmological parameters, quintessence, and the equation of
state of quintessence, and provides one of the cleanest determinations of
global cosmological parameters because it does not depend on the clustering
properties of any mass-energy components. The modified standard candle method
(using type Ia supernove) of determining the coordinate distance is compared in
detail with the modified standard yardstick method (using FRIIb radio
galaxies); the methods are found to be complementary. The most significant
difference between the methods is that the radio galaxy method is completely
independent of the local distance scale and the properties of local sources,
while the supernovae method is very closely tied to the local distance scale
and the properties of local sources. FRIIb radio galaxies provide one of the
very few reliable probes of the coordinate distance to sources with redshifts
out to two. The method indicates that the current value of the density
parameter in non-relativistic matter must be low irrespective of whether the
universe is spatially flat, and of whether a significant cosmological constant
or quintessence pervades the universe at the present epoch. FRIIb radio
galaxies indicate that the universe is currently accelerating in its expansion

diffuse scattering appears around the Burns temperature (~620K), indicating its
origin from the polar nanoregions (PNR). While the relative diffuse intensities
are consistent with previous reports, they are entirely different from those of
the lowest-energy TO phonon. Because of that, it has been considered that this
TO mode could not be the ferroelectric soft mode. Recently, a neutron
scattering study has unambiguously shown that the TO mode does soften on
cooling. If the diffuse scattering in PMN originates from the soft mode
condensation, then the atomic displacements must satisfy the center of mass
condition. But, the atomic displacements determined from diffuse scattering
intensities do not fulfill this condition. To resolve this contradiction, we
propose a simple model in which the total atomic displacement consists of two
components: $\delta_{CM}$ is created by the soft mode condensation, satisfying
the center of mass condition, and, $\delta_{shift}$ represents a uniform
displacement of the PNR along their polar direction relative to the surrounding
(unpolarized) cubic matrix. Within this framework, we can successfully describe
the neutron diffuse scattering intensities observed in PMN.

that the phase transition should be the bond dimerization due to the
cooperative effects of strong electronic correlation and electron-phonon
interaction. The results show that the ferro-orbital ordered state is
stabilized in a wide temperature range due to the strong on-site Coulomb
interaction between different t2g orbitals resulting in an effectively
one-dimensional electronic state, which leads the system toward an insulating
state by the Peierls lattice distortion with the period of two Fe(B) ions,
i.e., bond dimerization. Furthermore, it is found that the interplay between
such lattice distortion in the Fe(B) ions and the lattice elastic energy of the
Fe(B)-O as well as the Fe(A)-O bonds gives rise to a competition between two
different three-dimensional patterns for the bond dimerization, and can
stabilize a complicated one with a large unit cell size. The results are

opinion to bearish (bullish) if there is (1) either a majority of bearish

the number N of agents is infinite, the dynamics of the fraction of bullish

characterized by intermittent phases of chaos, quasi-periodic behavior and
super-exponentially growing bubbles followed by crashes. A typical bubble
starts initially by growing at an exponential rate and then crosses over to a
nonlinear power law growth rate leading to a finite-time singularity. The
reinjection mechanism provided by the contrarian behavior introduces a
finite-size effect, rounding off these singularities and leads to chaos. We

interferometers due to optical coatings, when the material properties of the
coating are different from those of the substrate and the mechanical loss angle
in the coating is anisotropic. The loss angle in the coatings for strains
parallel to the substrate surface was determined from ringdown experiments. We
measured the mechanical quality factor of three fused silica samples with
coatings deposited on them. The loss angle of the coating material for strains
parallel to the coated surface was found to be (4.2 +- 0.3)*10^(-4) for
coatings deposited on commercially polished slides and (1.0 +- 0.3)*10^{-4} for
a coating deposited on a superpolished disk. Using these numbers, we estimate
the effect of coatings on thermal noise in the initial LIGO and advanced LIGO
interferometers. We also find that the corresponding prediction for thermal
noise in the 40 m LIGO prototype at Caltech is consistent with the noise data.
These results are complemented by results for a different type of coating,

is in close analogy with the Standard Big Bang (SBB) model. The topology of the
Universe is assumed to be toroidal in all nine spatial dimensions and is filled
with a gas of p-branes. The dynamics of winding modes allow, at most, three
spatial dimensions to become large, thus explaining the origin of our
macroscopic 3+1-dimensional Universe. Here we conduct a detailed analysis of
the loitering phase of BGC. We do so by including into the equations of motion
that describe the dilaton gravity background some new equations which determine
the annihilation of string winding modes into string loops. Specific solutions
are found within the model that exhibit loitering, i.e. the Universe
experiences a short phase of slow contraction during which the Hubble radius
grows larger than the physical extent of the Universe. As a result the brane
problem (generalized domain wall problem) in BGC is solved. The initial
singularity and horizon problems of the SBB scenario are solved without relying
on an inflationary phase.

These reveal a basic asymmetry in these decompositions: subtle changes on one
side can force algebraic-topologically detectable changes on the other. A
solvable iteration of the basic invariant gives an ``obstruction theory'' using
lower commutator quotients. By thinking of a 2-handlebody as essentially
determined by the links used as attaching maps for its 2-handles this theory
can be thought of a giving ``ambient'' link invariants. The moves used are
related to the grope cobordism of links developed by Conant-Teichner, and the
Cochran-Orr-Teichner filtration of the link concordance groups. The invariants
give algebraically sophisticated ``finite type'' invariants in the sense of
Vassilaev.

replacing the usual first derivative coupling potential by a new,
second-derivative coupling potential. This paper first shows and discusses the
limitation of the standard coupled-channels theory in the case where one of the
nuclei in the reaction is strongly deformed. Then, this new approach is shown
to improve consistently the agreement with the experimental data and has made
major improvement on all the previous coupled-channels calculations for this
system.

decomposition coefficients take only the values of $1,i,-1,-i$. In numerous

surprisingly stable and never failed. There are numerical indications that the
probability of period finding given by the algorithm is a slowly decreasing
function of the number to be factorized and is typically less than in Shor's
algorithm. On the other hand, quantum computer (QC), capable of implementing
our algorithm, will require a much less amount of resources and will be much
less error-sensitive than standard QC. We also propose a modification of
Coppersmith' Approximate Fast Fourier Transform. The numerical results show
that the probability is signifacantly amplified even in the first post integral
approximation. Our algorithm can be very useful at early stages of development
of quantum computer.

such an initial state as overlaps equally, up to phases, with all the elements
of the computational basis. Second, we calculate the entanglement through the
algorithm for any number of qubits $n$ as the minimum Fubini-Study distance to
the submanifold formed by separable states in Segre embedding, and find that
entanglement is used almost maximally for large $n$. The computational time
seems to be optimized by the dynamics as the geodesic, running across entangled
states away from the submanifold of separable states, rather than the amount of
entanglement itself.
