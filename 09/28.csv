self-consistent phenomenological picture wherein the neutron stars born in the
observed wide HMXBs receive only a small kick (<~ 50 km/s), while neutron stars
born in isolation, in the majority of low-mass X-ray binaries, or in many of

natal kick to a neutron star born in a binary system depends on the rotation
rate of the pre-collapse core. We further suggest that the rotation rate of the
core is a strong, well-defined function of the evolutionary path of the
progenitor star.

show that it is expected to evolve very little out to z~2, once the selection

counts alone are considered. Ignoring systematic uncertainties, the combination
of cluster counts evolution and of the correlation function yields measurements

of galaxies can form massive binary black holes (BBHs). In this paper, we study
the evolution of massive BBHs in realistic galaxy models, using a
generalization of techniques used to study tidal disruption rates around
massive BHs. The evolution of BBHs depends on BH mass ratio and host galaxy
type. BBHs with very low mass ratios (say, $\la$ 0.001) are hardly ever formed
by mergers of galaxies because the dynamical friction timescale is too long for
the smaller BH to sink into the galactic center within a Hubble time. BBHs with
moderate mass ratios are most likely to form and survive in spherical or nearly
spherical galaxies and in high-luminosity or high-dispersion galaxies; they are
most likely to have merged in low-dispersion galaxies (line-of-sight velocity
dispersion $\la$ 90 km/s) or in highly flattened or triaxial galaxies. The
semimajor axes and orbital periods of surviving BBHs are generally in the range
10^{-3}-10 pc and 10-10^5 yr; and they are larger in high-dispersion galaxies
than in low-dispersion galaxies, larger in nearly spherical galaxies than in
highly flattened or triaxial galaxies, and larger for BBHs with equal masses
than for BBHs with unequal masses. The orbital velocities of surviving BBHs are
generally in the range 10^2-10^4 km/s. The methods of detecting surviving BBHs
are also discussed. If no evidence of BBHs is found in AGNs, this may be either
because gas plays a major role in BBH orbital decay or because nuclear activity
switches on soon after a galaxy merger, and ends before the smaller BH has had
time to spiral to the center of the galaxy.

a power law with index alpha_EUV = -1.76 +/- 0.12 (f_nu ~ nu^alpha) between 500

consistent with existing X-ray data, suggesting that the ionizing continuum may
be represented by a single power law. The resulting spectrum is roughly in
agreement with models of the intergalactic medium photoionized by the

find that secondary bars differ fundamentally from their large-scale

systems can be more chaotic or more regular in nature, and, contrary to
predictions, has no difficulty in penetrating the secondary bars. The outer
parts of both short and long nuclear bars (with respect to their corotation)
appear to be depopulated of gas, while deep inside them the flow exhibits low
Mach numbers and follows ovally-shaped orbits with little dissipation. We find
that gas-dominated and star-dominated nuclear bars avoid the bar-bar interface,
making both types of bars short relative to their corotation. Furthermore, our
earlier work has shown that dynamically-coupled secondary bars exhibit a
similarly relaxed low-dissipation flow as well. Therefore, no large-scale
shocks form in the nuclear bars, and consequently, no offset dust lanes are
expected there. We find that offset dust lanes cannot be used in the search for

shorter periods had more rapidly rotating primaries prior to their explosion:
centrifugal support will then prevent more of its mass from collapsing into the
black hole. This trend of more rapidly rotating stars in closer binaries is
very generally seen, and in the present case can be understood in terms of
spin-up during spiral in and subsequent tidal coupling. We investigate the
relation quantitatively and obtain reasonable agreement with the observed
mass-period correlation. A natural consequence of this observation is that
black holes formed in soft X-ray transients acquire significant Kerr
parameters. This makes them good sources of power for gamma-ray bursts and
hypernovae, via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, and thus supports our model for
the origin of gamma-ray bursts in soft X-ray transients.

isolated black holes may be fewer in number than neutron stars, N_NS ~ 1
billion, their higher masses, <M>~9 M_sun, and smaller space velocities, v ~ 40

black-hole X-ray binaries given a total number of black holes N_tot= N_9 1.E9.
If black holes accrete at efficiencies only ~1.E-4(N_NS/N_tot)^0.8 of the
neutron-star accretion efficiency, a comparable number of each may be
detectable. We make predictions for the number of isolated accreting black
holes in our Galaxy which can be detected with X-ray surveys as a function of
efficiency, concluding that all-sky surveys at a depth of F = f 1.E-15

find tens of these objects per year, depending on the efficiency. We argue that

K-magnitude is K=19.26 within a 2"" diameter aperture. The distribution of R-K
colors indicates that at least 1/3 of the objects observed have very red colors
(R-K>5). The major axes of the identifications in K-band are preferentially
oriented along the radio axes, with half of them having compact morphologies.
  The 22 sources with spectroscopic redshifts and K-band magnitudes follow the
K-z relation found from previous radio samples, but with a larger scatter. We
argue that this may be due to a dependence of K-magnitude on the radio power,
with the highest radio power sources inhabiting the most massive host galaxies.
We present a composite K-z diagram of radio-loud and radio-quiet galaxies,
selected from the HDF-North and the Hawaii surveys. Out to z <~ 1, the
radio-loud galaxies trace the bright envelope of the radio quiet galaxies,
while at z >~ 1, the radio-loud galaxies are >~ 2 magnitudes brighter. We argue
that this is not due to a contribution from the AGN or emission lines. This
difference strongly suggests that radio galaxies pinpoint the most massive
systems out to the highest known redshifts, probably due to the mutual
correlation of the mass of the galaxy and the radio power on the mass of the
central black hole.

longer satisfy the tracker approximation if the equation of state parameter
varies moderately with cosmic scale. We are optimistic about distinguishing
between a cosmological constant and appreciably dynamic quintessence, by
measuring average values for the effective equation of state parameter.

scale dependence appears problematic in the near future. For our flat universe,
at present dominated by smooth energy in the form of either a cosmological
constant (LCDM) or quintessence (QCDM), we calculate the asymptotic collapsed
mass fraction to be maximal at the observed smooth energy/matter ratio.
Identifying this collapsed fraction as a conditional probability for habitable
galaxies, we infer that the prior distribution is flat. Interpreting this prior
as a distribution over theories, rather than as a distribution over
unobservable subuniverses, leads us to heuristic predictions about the class of
future quantum cosmology theories and the static or quasi-static nature of the

electron-electron interactions, and spin-orbit coupling in metal nanoparticles
and semiconductor quantum dots. For a closed system, in the absence of
spin-orbit coupling or of an external magnetic field, electron-electron
interactions make it possible to have ground states with spin $S > 1/2$. We
review here a theoretical analysis which makes predictions for the probability
of finding various values of spin $S$ for an irregular particle in the limit
where the number of electron is large but finite. We also present results for
the probability distribution of the spacing between successive groundstate
energies in such a particle. In a metallic particle with strong spin-orbit
interactions, for odd electron number, the groundstate has a Kramers'
degeneracy, which is split linearly by a weak applied magnetic field. The
splitting may be characterized by an effective $g$-tensor whose principal axes
and eigenvalues vary from one level to another. Recent calculations have
addressed the joint probability distribution, including the anisotropy, of the
eigenvalues. The peculiar form of the spin-orbit coupling for a two-dimensional
electron system in a GaAs heterostructure or quantum well leads to a strong
suppression of spin-orbit effects when the electrons are confined in a small
quantum dot. Spin-effects can be enhanced, however, in the presence of an
applied magnetic field parallel to the layer, which may explain recent
observations on fluctuations in the conductances through such dots. We also
discuss possible explanations for the experimental observations by Davidovic
and Tinkham of a multiplet splitting of the lowest resonance in the tunneling
conductance through a gold nano-particle.

from axisymmetry, the intrinsic geometry of the horizon is almost axisymmetric.
The origin of the large apparent non-axisymmetry of the metric is the
deformation of the coordinate system in which the metric was computed.

replaced by a `non-perturbative $k^{-4}$ form obtained via two
differentiations: $ \mu^2 \partial_m^2 (m^2+k^2)^{-1}$, ($\mu$ a scale

for the input $q{\bar q}$ kernel the gluon propagator is replaced by the above
$k^{-4}$ form. With these `linear' simulations, the respective condensates are
obtained by `looping' up the gluon and quark lines in the standard manner.
Using Dimensional regularization (DR), the necessary integrals yield the
condensates plus temperature corrections, with a common scale parameter $\mu$
for both. For gluons the exact result is $$ <GG> =
{36\mu^4}\pi^{-3}\alpha_s(\mu^2)[2-\gamma - 4\pi^2 T^2/(3\mu^2)]$$. Evaluation
of the quark condensate is preceded by an approximate solution of the SDE for

correlation functions, as well as the identification of the operator content of
the QFT and the development of various consistency checks. Taking as an input
the S-matrix proposal for the HSG-models, we confirm its consistency by
carrying out both a Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) and a Form Factor
analysis. In contrast to many other 1+1-dimensional integrable models studied
in the literature, the HSG-models break parity, both at the level of the
Lagrangian and S-matrix, and their spectrum includes unstable particles. These
features have specific consequences in our analysis which are given a physical

QFT advocated to the HSG-models. We evaluate correlation functions of various
local operators of the model as well as Zamolodchikov's c-function and

different local operators are interrelated by means of the momentum space

de Sitter space can arise as a solution of N=8 gauged supergravities in four or
five dimensions. These lift to solutions of 11-dimensional supergravity or D=10

supersymmetric solution of an unconventional supergravity theory, which
typically has some kinetic terms with the `wrong' sign; such solutions are
invariant under a de Sitter supergroup. Such solutions lift to supersymmetric
solutions of unconventional supergravities in D=10 or D=11, which nonetheless
arise as field theory limits of theories that can be obtained from M-theory by
timelike T-dualities and related dualities. Brane solutions interpolate between
these solutions and flat space and lead to a holographic duality between

quantization of QED (1927) and its generalization to the non-Abelian theories
(Yang-Mills and QCD) with the topological degeneration of initial data. Using
the Dirac variables we give a systematic description of relativistic nonlocal
bound states in QED with a choice of the time axis of quantization along the
eigenvectors of their total momentum operator.
  We show that the Dirac variables of the non-Abelian fields are topologically
degenerated, and there is a pure gauge Higgs effect in the sector of the zero
winding number that leads to a nonperturbative physical vacuum in the form of
the Wu-Yang monopole. Phases of the topological degeneration in the new
perturbation theory are determined by an equation of the Gribov ambiguity of
the constraint-shell gauge defined as an integral of the Gauss equation with
zero initial data. The constraint-shell non-Abelian dynamics includes zero mode
of the Gauss law differential operator, and a rising potential of the
instantaneous interaction, that rearranges the perturbation series and changes
the assymptotic freedom formula.
  The Dirac variables in QCD with the topological degeneration of initial data
describe constituent gluon, and quark masses, the spontaneous chiral symmetry
breaking, color confinement in the form of quark-hadron duality as a
consequence of summing over the Gribov copies. A solution of U(1)-problem is
given by mixing the zero mode with $\eta_0$ - meson. We discuss reasons why all
these physical effects disappear for arbitrary gauges of physical sources in
the standard Faddeev-Popov integral.

massless field in a higher dimensional global monopole spacetime, i.e., a
$(1+d)$-spacetime with $d\geq3$ which presents a solid angle deficit. Our
result is expressed in terms of a infinite sum of products of Legendre
functions with Gegenbauer polynomials. Although this Green function cannot be
expressed in a closed form, for the specific case where the solid angle deficit
is very small, it is possible to develop the sum and obtain the Green function
in a more workable expression. Having this expression it is possible to
calculate the vacuum expectation value of some relevant operators. As an
application of this formalism, we calculate the renormalized vacuum expectation
value of the square of the scalar field, $<\Phi^2(x)>_{Ren.}$, and the
energy-momentum tensor, $<T_{\mu\nu}(x)>_{Ren.}$, for the global monopole
spacetime with spatial dimensions $d=4$ and $d=5$.

a discrete finite system in which correlations explicitly due to the finite
extent of the system are suppressed. To this end, we introduce a combinatorial
model, which describes the fragmentation of a finite system as a sequence of
independent random emissions of fragments. The sequence is accepted when the
sum of the sizes is equal to the total size. The parameters of the model, which
may be used to calculate all partition probabilities, are the intrinsic
probabilities associated with the fragments. Any fragment size correlation
function can be built by calculating the ratio between the partition
probabilities in the data sample (resulting from an experiment or from a Monte
Carlo simulation) and the 'independent emission' model partition probabilities.
This technique is applied to charge correlations introduced by Moretto and
collaborators. It is shown that the percolation and the nuclear statistical
multifragmentaion model ({\sc smm}) are almost independent emission models
whereas the nuclear spinodal decomposition model ({\sc bob}) shows strong
correlations corresponding to the break-up of the hot dilute nucleus into
nearly equal size fragments.

spectrum is demonstrated within the example of the square barrier potential.
The non-square integrable solutions of the time-independent Schrodinger
equation are used to define Dirac kets, which are (generalized) eigenvectors of
the Hamiltonian. These Dirac kets are antilinear functionals over the space of
physical wave functions. They are also basis vectors that expand any physical
wave function in a Dirac basis vector expansion. It is shown that an acceptable
physical wave function must fulfill stronger conditions than just square
integrability--the space of physical wave functions is not the whole Hilbert
space but rather a dense subspace of the Hilbert space. We construct the
position and energy representations of the Rigged Hilbert Space generated by
the square barrier potential Hamiltonian. We shall also construct the unitary
operator that transforms from the position into the energy representation. We
shall see that in the energy representation the Dirac kets act as the
antilinear Schwartz delta functional. In constructing the Rigged Hilbert Space
of the square barrier potential, we will find a systematic procedure to
construct the Rigged Hilbert Space of a large class of spherically symmetric
potentials. The example of the square barrier potential will also make apparent
that the natural framework for the solutions of a Schrodinger operator with
continuous spectrum is the Rigged Hilbert Space rather than just the Hilbert
space.

realisable operations that realise as closely as possible certain desired
transformations between quantum states, e.g. quantum cloning, teleportation,
quantum gates, etc. Mathematically, this problem boils down to finding a
completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) linear map that maximizes the
(mean) fidelity between the map itself and the desired transformation. In this
note we want to draw attention to the fact that this problem belongs to the
class of so-called semidefinite programming (SDP) problems. As SDP problems are
convex, it immediately follows that they do not suffer from local optima.
Furthermore, this implies that the numerical optimization of the CPTP map can,
and should, be done using methods from the well-established SDP field, as these
methods exploit convexity and are guaranteed to converge to the real solution.
Finally, we show how the duality inherent to convex and SDP problems can be
exploited to prove analytically the optimality of a proposed solution. We give
an example of how to apply this proof method by proving the optimality of Hardy
and Song's proposed solution for the universal qubit $\theta$-shifter
(quant-ph/0102100).
