  Estimate of the Star Formation Rate at High Redshifts","Final version accepted to the Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/341059","LA-UR: 01-4881","astro-ph",,"  Using 220 Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) redshifts and luminosities derived from the
luminosity-variability relationship of Fenimore & Ramirez-Ruiz (2000), we show
that there exists a significant correlation between the GRB luminosity and
redshift. In particular, we find that the evolution of the average luminosity
can be parameterized as L ~ (1+z)^(1.4 +- 0.5), where z is the burst redshift.
We discuss the possible reasons behind this evolution and compare it to other
known sources that exhibit similar behavior. In addition, we use non-parametric
statistical techniques to independently estimate the distributions of the
luminosity and redshift of bursts, accounting for the evolution (in contrast to
previous studies which have assumed that the luminosity function is independent
of redshift). We present these distributions and discuss their implications.
Most significantly, we find a co-moving rate density of GRBs that continues to
increase to (1+z) ~ 10. From this estimate of the GRB rate density, we then use
the population synthesis codes of Fryer et al. (1999) to estimate the star
formation rate at high redshifts, based on different progenitor models of GRBs.
We find that no matter what the progenitor or population synthesis model, the
star formation rate increases or remains constant to very high redshifts (z ~
10).

  and the Growth of Supermassive Black Holes","30 pages, 6 figures, significant improvements: added new constraint,
  revised old constraints, changed figures",,"10.1086/340226",,"astro-ph",,"  We consider the consequences of SIDM for a velocity dependent cross section
per unit mass. Accretion of SIDM onto seed black holes can produce supermassive
black holes that are too large for certain combinations of parameters,which is
used to obtain a new constraint on the dark matter interaction. Constraints due
to other considerations are presented and previous ones are generalized. The
black hole constraint is extremely sensitive to the slope \alpha, of the inner
density profile of dark halos. For the most probable value of \alpha=1.3, there
exists a narrow range in parameter space, such that all constraints are
satisfied. However, the adiabatic compression of the dark halo by baryons as
they cool and contract in normal galaxies yields a steeper cusp, \alpha=1.7.
This gives a tighter constraint, which would exclude SIDM as a possible
solution to the purported problems with CDM in the absence of other dynamical
processes. Nevertheless, SIDM with parameters consistent with this stronger
constraint, can explain the ubiquity of supermassive black holes in the centers
of galaxies. A ``best fit'' model is presented which reproduces the
supermassive black hole masses and their observed correlations with the
velocity dispersion of the host bulges. Specifically, the fourth power
dependence of black hole mass on velocity dispersion is a direct consequence of
the power spectrum having an index of n=-2. Although the dark matter collision
rates for this model are too small to directly remedy problems with CDM,
mergers between dark halos harboring supermassive black holes at high redshift
could ameliorate the cuspy halo problem. This scenario also explains the lack
of comparable supermassive black holes in bulgeless galaxies like M33.

arising from linear physics operating in the early Universe, is in reasonably

the data with the theory: mapping, filtering, comparing, cleaning, compressing,
forecasting, estimating. There have been many algorithmic advances in the
analysis pipeline in recent years, but still more are needed for the forecasts
of high precision cosmic parameter estimation to be realized. For secondary
anisotropies, those arising once nonlinearity develops, the computational state
of the art currently needs effort in all the areas: the Sunyaev-Zeldovich
effect, inhomogeneous reionization, gravitational lensing, the Rees-Sciama
effect, dusty galaxies. We use the Sunyaev-Zeldovich example to illustrate the
issues. The direct interface with observations for these non-Gaussian signals
is much more complex than for Gaussian primary anisotropies, and even more so
for the statistically inhomogeneous Galactic foregrounds. Because all the
signals are superimposed, the separation of components inevitably complicates
primary CMB analyses as well.
