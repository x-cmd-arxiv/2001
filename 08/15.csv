  Astronomical Journal, in press for December 2001",,"10.1086/323928",,"astro-ph",,"  The metallicity distribution function (MDF) for the old red-giant stars in
the halo of NGC 5128, the nearest giant elliptical galaxy, is virtually
identical with the MDF for the old-disk stars in the LMC and also strongly
resembles the halo MDF in M31. These galaxies all have high mean halo
metallicities (<m/H> ~ -0.4$) with very small proportions of low-metallicity
stars. These observations reinforce the view that metal-rich halos are quite
normal for large galaxies of all types. Such systems are unlikely to have built
up by accretion of pre-existing, gas-free small satellite galaxies, unless
these satellites had an extremely shallow mass distribution (d log N / d log M
> -1). We suggest that the halo of NGC 5128 is more likely to have assembled
from hierarchical merging of gas-rich lumps in which the bulk of star formation
took place during or after the merger stage.

resolution QSO spectra of the Ly alpha forest at <z> = 2.9. Rather than
investigating variations in the number density of individual absorption lines
we employ a novel technique that is based on the statistics of the transmitted
flux itself. We confirm the existence of the proximity effect at the > 99 per
cent confidence level. We derive a value for the mean intensity of the
extragalactic background radiation at the Lyman limit of J = 3.5^{+3.5}_{-1.3}
x 10^{-22} ergs/s/cm^2/Hz/sr. This value assumes that QSO redshifts measured
from high ionization lines differ from the true systemic redshifts by ~800
km/s. We find evidence at a level of 2.6 sigma that the significance of the
proximity effect is correlated with QSO Lyman limit luminosity. Allowing for
known QSO variability the significance of the correlation reduces to 2.1 sigma.
The QSOs form a close group on the sky and the sample is thus well suited for
an investigation of the foreground proximity effect, where the Ly alpha forest
of a background QSO is influenced by the UV radiation from a nearby foreground
QSO. From the complete sample we find no evidence for the existence of this
effect, implying either that J > 20 x 10^{-22} ergs/s/cm^2/Hz/sr or that QSOs
emit at least a factor of 1.4 less ionizing radiation in the plane of the sky
than along the line of sight to Earth. We do however find one counter-example.
Our sample includes the fortunate constellation of a foreground QSO surrounded
by four nearby background QSOs. These four spectra all show underdense
absorption within +/-3000 km/s of the redshift of the foreground QSO.

disk of gas and dust imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), around a
central supermassive black hole. Previous VLBI observations of NGC4261 revealed
a gap in emission in the radio counterjet, presumably due to free-free
absorption in the inner parsec of the accretion disk. Here we present three 8
GHz VLBA observations of NGC4261 that allow us to monitor the location and
depth of the gap, and check for motions in the jet and counterjet. The
separation between the brightest peak and the gap is stable, with an upper
limit to its motion of 0.01 c, supporting the interpretation of the gap as
absorption by an accretion disk rather than an intrinsic jet feature. These
observations span a time of order that required for orbiting material in the
disk to transit the counterjet, so we are able to search for density changes
(clumps) in the disk by monitoring the optical depth of the gap. The optical
depth of the gap is stable to within 20% over 5 years at tau = 1.1 +/- 0.1,
corresponding to an electron density in the disk that is constant to within
10%. We measure an apparent speed in the jet of 0.52 +/- 0.07 c. An apparent
speed could not be measured for the counterjet due to a lack of identifiable
features. From the apparent jet speed and the jet to counterjet brightness
ratio, we calculate the viewing angle of the jet to be 63 +/- 3 degrees and its
intrinsic speed to be 0.46 +/- 0.02 c. From the inclination and position angles
of the parsec-scale radio jet and outer HST disk rotation axis we calculate a
difference between the parsec-scale radio jet and outer HST disk rotation axis

for square lattice antiferromagnets is a lattice discretization of the quantum
non-linear sigma model, along with Berry phases which impose quantization of
spin. With full SU(2) spin rotation invariance, we find a magnetically ordered
ground state with Neel order at weak coupling, and a confining paramagnetic
ground state with bond charge (e.g. spin Peierls) order at strong coupling. We
study the mechanisms by which these two states are connected in intermediate
coupling. We extend the minimal model to study different routes to
fractionalization and deconfinement in the ground state, and also generalize it
to cases with a uniaxial anisotropy (the spin symmetry group is then U(1)). For
the latter systems, fractionalization can appear by the pairing of vortices in
the staggered spin order in the easy-plane; however, we argue that this route
does not survive the restoration of SU(2) spin symmetry. For SU(2) invariant
systems we study a separate route to fractionalization associated with the
Higgs phase of a complex boson measuring non-collinear, spiral spin
correlations: we present phase diagrams displaying competition between magnetic
order, bond charge order, and fractionalization, and discuss the nature of the
quantum transitions between the various states. A strong check on our methods
is provided by their application to S=1/2 frustrated antiferromagnets in one

Carlo searches for the low-energy states of proteins. Our strategy is motivated
by a model of how proteins alter their shapes. In our model when proteins fold
under physiological conditions, their backbone dihedral angles change
synchronously in groups of four or more so as to avoid steric clashes and
respect the kinematic conservation laws. They wriggle; they do not thrash. We
describe a simple algorithm that can be used to incorporate wriggling in Monte
Carlo simulations of protein folding. We have tested this wriggling algorithm
against a code in which the dihedral angles are varied independently
(thrashing). Our standard of success is the average root-mean-square distance
(rmsd) between the alpha-carbons of the folding protein and those of its native
structure. After 100,000 Monte Carlo sweeps, the relative decrease in the mean
rmsd, as one switches from thrashing to wriggling, rises from 11% for the
protein 3LZM with 164 amino acids (aa) to 40% for the protein 1A1S with 313 aa
and 47% for the protein 16PK with 415 aa. These results suggest that wriggling
is useful and that its utility increases with the size of the protein. One may
implement wriggling on a parallel computer or a computer farm.

This is in contrast to interband semiconductor diode lasers in which the laser
intensity noise can be squeezed well below the shot noise limit by high
impedance suppression of fluctuations in the drive current. The theoretical
model presented in this paper self-consistently accounts for the suppression of
current noise in electron transport in multiple quantum well structures due to
various electronic correlations. The nature of these electronic correlations is
discussed. Mechanisms responsible for the reduced photon number squeezing in
intersubband lasers are elucidated. Scaling of the laser intensity noise and
the current noise with the number of cascaded gain stages is also described.
Direct current modulation response of quantum cascade lasers is also studied,
and it is shown that contrary to the predictions in the literature of terahertz
modulation bandwidth for these lasers, bandwidth of almost all quantum cascade

However, higher Fock states in the B wave function containing charm quark pairs

Such intrinsic charm contributions can be phenomenologically significant. Since
they mimic the amplitude structure of ``charming'' penguin contributions,
charming penguins need not be penguins at all.

estimating portfolio risk extremely questionable. In periods of market stress
correlations of risk factors have a tendency to quickly go well beyond

expect with certainty to see the correlation of yield levels and credit spreads
go to -1, even though historical estimates will miss this region of
correlation. This event might lead to realized portfolio risk profile
substantially different from what was initially estimated. The purpose of this
paper is to explore the correlation driven effects on fixed income portfolio
risks. To achieve this, we propose a methodology to estimate portfolio risks in

momentum experiences an attractive force. This force originates from a
modification of the classical centrifugal force due to the wave nature of the
particle. For positive energies the quantum anti-centrifugal force manifests
itself in a bunching of the nodes of the energy wave functions towards the
origin. For negative energies this force is sufficient to create a bound state
in a two-dimensional delta function potential. In a counter-intuitive way the
attractive force pushes the particle away from the location of the delta
function potential. As a consequence, the particle is localized in a
band-shaped domain around the origin

to be decoherence events. If so, then inexact decoherence may allow large
worlds to mangle the memory of observers in small worlds, creating a cutoff in
observable world size. Smaller world are mangled and so not observed. If this
cutoff is much closer to the median measure size than to the median world size,
the distribution of outcomes seen in unmangled worlds follows the Born rule.
Thus deviations from exact decoherence can allow the Born rule to be derived
via world counting, with a finite number of worlds and no new fundamental
physics.
