constant in low-density universes. Using high-resolution cosmological
N-body/SPH simulations of flat (\Omega_0 = 0.3, \lambda_0 = 0.7, \Lambda CDM)
and open (\Omega_0 = 0.3, \lambda_0 = 0, OCDM) cold dark matter universes, we
calculate statistical indicators to quantify the irregularity of the cluster
morphologies. We study axial ratios, center shifts, cluster clumpiness, and
multipole moment power ratios as indicators for the simulated clusters at z=0
and 0.5. Some of these indicators are calculated for both the X-ray surface
brightness and projected mass distributions. In \Lambda CDM all these
indicators tend to be larger than those in OCDM at z=0. This result is
consistent with the analytical prediction of Richstone, Loeb, & Turner, that
is, clusters in \Lambda CDM are formed later than in OCDM, and have more
substructure at z=0. We make a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on each indicator for
these two models. We then find that the results for the multipole moment power
ratios and the center shifts for the X-ray surface brightness are under the
significance level (5%). We results also show that these two cosmological
models can be distinguished more clearly at z=0 than z = 0.5 by these
indicators.

are a promising candidate for the origin of high galactic-latitude, steady
unidentified EGRET gamma-ray sources. Instead of using past optical catalogs of
eye-selected clusters, we made a matched-filter survey of galaxy clusters over
$4\arcdeg \times 4\arcdeg$ areas around seven steady unidentified EGRET sources
at $|b|>45\arcdeg$ together with a 100 $\sq \arcdeg$ area near the South
Galactic Pole as a control field. In total, 154 Abell-like cluster candidates
and 18 close pairs/groups of these clusters, expected to be possibly merging
clusters, were identified within estimated redshift $z_{est}\leq 0.15$. Five
among the seven EGRET sources have one or two cluster pairs/groups (CPGs)
within 1$\arcdeg$ from them. We assess the statistical significance of this
result by several methods, and the confidence level of the real excess is
maximally 99.8% and 97.8% in a conservative method. In contrast, we found no
significant correlation with single clusters. In addition to the spatial
correlation, we also found that the richness of CPGs associated with EGRET
sources is considerably larger than those of CPGs in the control field. These
results imply that a part of the steady unidentified EGRET sources at
high-latitude are physically associated with close CPGs, not with single
clusters. We also discuss possible interpretations of these results. We argue
that, if these associations are real, they are difficult to explain by hadronic
processes, but best explained by the inverse-Compton scattering by high energy
electrons accelerated in shocks of cluster formation, as recently proposed.

intensity states in 2 of the 3 sources, there was no identifiable quiescent

blazars have a characteristic time scale of ~ a day, comparable to the
recurrence time and to the time scale of the stronger flares. On the other
hand, examination of these flares in more detail reveals that each of the
strong flares is not a smooth increase and decrease, but exhibits substructures
of shorter flares having time scales of ~10 ks. We verify via simulations that
in order to explain the observed structure function, these shorter flares
(""shots"") are unlikely to be fully random, but in some way are correlated with
each other. The energy dependent cross-correlation analysis shows that
inter-band lags are not universal in TeV blazars. This is important since in
the past, only positive detections of lags were reported. In this work, we
determine that the sign of a lag may differ from flare to flare; significant
lags of both signs were detected from several flares, while no significant lag
was detected from others. However, we also argue that the nature of the
underlying component can affect these values. The facts that all flares are
nearly symmetric and that fast variability shorter than the characteristic time
scale is strongly suppressed, support the scenario where the light crossing
time dominates the variability time scales of the day-scale flares.

four-momentum transfer of Q^2=0.05 GeV^2/c^2. The data were taken with the
three-spectrometer setup of the A1 Collaboration at the Mainz Microtron MAMI.
The complete center of mass solid angle was covered up to a center of mass
energy of 4 MeV above threshold. Combined with measurements at three different
values of the virtual photon polarization \epsilon, the structure functions
\sigma_T, \sigma_L, \sigma_{TT}, and \sigma_{TL} are determined. The results
are compared with calculations in Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory and
with a phenomenological model. The measured cross section is significantly
smaller than both predictions.

Photosynthesis is one example in which a 'quantum computer' component may play
a role in the 'classical' world of complex biological systems. A 'translation'
of the standard metabolic description of the 'front-end' light harvesting
complex in photosynthesis into the language of quantum computers is presented.
Biological systems represent an untapped resource for thinking about the design
and operation of hybrid quantum-classical computers and expanding our current
conceptions of what defines a 'quantum computer' in Nature.

degrees of entanglement and entropy using an optical two-qubit source based on
spontaneous parametric downconversion. The states are characterised using
measures of entanglement and entropy determined from tomographically determined
density matrices. The Tangle-Entropy plane is introduced as a graphical
representation of these states, and the theoretic upper bound for the maximum
amount of entanglement possible for a given entropy is presented. Such a
combination of general quantum state creation and accurate characterisation is
an essential prerequisite for quantum device development.
