in disk galaxies. The 112 galaxies in our sample comprise the largest matched
Seyfert vs. non-Seyfert sample of nearby galaxies with complete near-infrared
or optical imaging sensitive to lengthscales ranging from tens of pc to tens of
kpc. We find that a significant fraction of the sample galaxies, 17% +/- 4%,
has more than one bar, and that 28% +/- 5% of barred galaxies have nested bars.
The bar fractions appear to be stable according to reasonable changes in our
adopted bar criteria. For these nested bars, we detect a clear division in
length between the large-scale (primary) bars and small-scale (secondary) bars,
both in absolute and normalized (to the size of the galaxy) length. We argue
that this bimodal distribution can be understood within the framework of the
inner Lindblad resonances (ILRs), which are located where the gravitational
potential of the innermost galaxy switches effectively from 3D to 2D. While
primary bars are found to correlate with the host galaxy sizes, no such
correlation is observed for the secondary bars. Moreover, we find that
secondary bars differ morphologically from single bars. Overall, our matched
Seyfert and non-Seyfert samples show a statistically significant excess of bars
among the Seyfert galaxies at practically all lengthscales. We confirm our
previous result that Seyfert galaxies always show a preponderance of ""thick""
bars compared to the bars in non-Seyfert galaxies. Finally, no correlation is
observed between the presence of a bar and that of companion galaxies, even
relatively bright ones.

stars naturally predicts the truncation of the circumstellar disc. The distance
at which the circumstellar disc is truncated depends mainly on the orbital
parameters and the viscosity. In systems with low eccentricity, the disc is
expected to be truncated at the 3:1 resonance radius, for which the gap between
the disc outer radius and the critical lobe radius of the Be star is so wide
that, under normal conditions, the neutron star cannot accrete enough gas at
periastron passage to show Type I X-ray outbursts. These systems will display
only Type II X-ray outbursts. On the other hand, in systems with high orbital
eccentricity, the disc truncation occurs at a much higher resonance radius,
which is very close to or slightly beyond the critical lobe radius at
periastron unless the viscosity is very low. In these systems, disc truncation
cannot be efficient, allowing the neutron star to capture gas from the disc at
every periastron passage and display Type I outbursts regularly. In contrast to
the rather robust results for systems with low eccentricity and high
eccentricity, the result for systems with moderate eccentricity depends on
rather subtle details. Systems in which the disc is truncated in the vicinity
of the critical lobe will regularly display Type I outbursts, whereas those
with the disc significantly smaller than the critical lobe will show only Type
II outbursts under normal conditions and temporary Type I outbursts when the
disc is strongly disturbed.

modelling the broadband emission of their afterglows. We find that the burst
kinetic energies after the GRB phase are well clustered around a mean value of
3E50 ergs. In contrast, the energy release in gamma-rays, after correcting for
collimated explosion, varies among bursts by more than an order of magnitude.
  The jet initial apertures are the 2-14 degree range, mildly correlated with
the energy, half of the jets being narrower than ~3 deg. This implies that,
within 100 Mpc, there are about 10 GRB remnants (expanding at ~0.1c) which can
be resolved with VLBA.
  For all eight afterglows the total energy in the shock-accelerated electrons
is close to equipartition with protons. However the slope of the power-law
electron distribution is not universal, varying between 1.4 and 2.8.
  In at least half of the cases, the density structure of the medium is
inconsistent with an r^{-2} profile. A homogeneous medium with density in the
0.1-50 per cc range can accommodate the broadband emission of all afterglows,
with the exception of 990123, for which we find the density to be less than
0.01 per cc. If GRBs arise from the core collapse of massive stars, then such
low densities indicate the existence of superbubbles created by the supernovae

that theoretical methods based on inverse-photoionization calculations (e.g.,
undamped R-matrix methods) will severely overestimate the strength of the DR

the coupling between the DR and radiative recombination (RR) channels is small.

the range of 0.12-0.17, similar to the value seen in the Milky Way disk, and

intermediate (submaximal) disks does not ameliorate the discrepancy between the

heating by X-rays and examine its effectiveness, compared to whole grain

previous studies, whole grain heating is effective only for small grains (< 500

heating cannot sustain an equilibrium gas phase abundance of CO. Spot heating,
in which the incident X-ray deposits energy in only a restricted region of the
grain volume and which may occur as a consequence of the aggregate nature of
grains, proves to be more promising. Assuming that grains are comprised of many
thermal subunits that are poorly connected thermally, we find that spot heating
is efficient at all grain sizes if large grains are effectively ``coated'' with

transport current is measured using magneto-optical imaging at 20 K. The
current is applied in pulses of 40-5000 ms duration and magnitude close to the
critical one, 5.5 A. During the pulse some extra flux usually penetrates the
strip, so the local field increases in magnitude. When the strip is initially
penetrated by flux, the local field either increases or decreases depending
both on the spatial coordinate and the current magnitude. Meanwhile, the
current density always tends to redistribute more uniformly. Despite the
relaxation, all distributions remain qualitatively similar to the Bean model
predictions.

early stage phase separation in a symmetric binary polymer mixture. We consider
quenches from the disordered phase into the region of spinodal instability. On
a mean field level we approach this problem with two methods: a dynamical
extension of the self consistent field theory for Gaussian chains, with the
density variables evolving in time, and the method of the external potential
dynamics where the effective external fields are propagated in time. Different
wave vector dependencies of the kinetic coefficient are taken into account.
These early stages of spinodal decomposition are also studied through Monte
Carlo simulations employing the bond fluctuation model that maps the chains --
in our case with 64 effective segments -- on a coarse grained lattice. The
results obtained through self consistent field calculations and Monte Carlo
simulations can be compared because the time, length, and temperature scales
are mapped onto each other through the diffusion constant, the chain extension,
and the energy of mixing. The quantitative comparison of the relaxation rate of
the global structure factor shows that a kinetic coefficient according to the
Rouse model gives a much better agreement than a local, i.e. wave vector
independent, kinetic factor. Including fluctuations in the self consistent
field calculations leads to a shorter time span of spinodal behaviour and a
reduction of the relaxation rate for smaller wave vectors and prevents the
relaxation rate from becoming negative for larger values of the wave vector.
This is also in agreement with the simulation results.

measurements on a MgB2 superconductor prepared by high pressure synthesis. We
find that the upper critical field is linearly dependent on temperature near Tc
and the dc irreversibility field exponent is ~1.4. The microwave data display
an excess surface resistance below Tc which is neither observed in low Tc nor
in high temperature superconductors (HTSC). The real part of the complex
conductivity, sigma1, shows a huge maximum below Tc and the imaginary part,
sigma2, is linear for temperatures less than 20 K, which can not be simply
accounted for by the weak coupling BCS model with an s-wave superconducting
order parameter. We speculate that this may be due to the two gaps reported by
other studies. Unlike measurements on the high temperature superconducting
cuprates, we find no evidence of weak-links in the superconducting state. By
inverting the magnetic field dependent impedance data, we find a vortex
depinning frequency that decreases with increasing magnetic field and evidence
for an anisotropic upper critical magnetic field.

quenched QCD can provide quantitative information about QCD itself, with the
aid of partially quenched chiral perturbation theory. A barrier to doing this
has been the inclusion of $\Phi_0$, the partially quenched generalization of
the $\eta'$, in previous calculations in the partially quenched effective
theory. This invalidates the low energy perturbative expansion, gives rise to
many new unknown parameters, and makes it impossible to reliably calculate the
relation between the partially quenched theory and low energy QCD. We show that
it is straightforward and natural to formulate partially quenched chiral
perturbation theory without $\Phi_0$, and that the resulting theory contains
the effective theory for QCD without the $\eta'$. We also show that previous
results, obtained including $\Phi_0$, can be reinterpreted as applying to the
theory without $\Phi_0$. We contrast the situation with that in the quenched
effective theory, where we explain why it is necessary to include $\Phi_0$.
  We also compare the derivation of chiral perturbation theory in partially
quenched QCD with the standard derivation in unquenched QCD. We find that the
former cannot be justified as rigorously as the latter, because of the absence
of a physical Hilbert space. Finally, we present an encouraging result:
unphysical double poles in certain correlation functions in partially quenched
chiral perturbation theory can be shown to be a property of the underlying
theory, given only the symmetries and some plausible assumptions.

them through operator mixing. Under the assumption that only this operator

maximal mixing prediction for solar neutrinos is very sharp even when higher

over R, via the definition of two functors (from HA to itself) such that the

nuclear moments. In turn, these moments can induce electric dipole moments
(EDMs) in atoms through the mixing of electron wavefunctions of opposite
parity. The nuclear EDM is screened by atomic electrons. The EDM of an atom
with closed electron subshells is induced by the nuclear Schiff moment.
Previously the interaction with the Schiff moment has been defined for a
point-like nucleus. No problems arise with the calculation of the electron
matrix element of this interaction as long as the electrons are considered to
be non-relativistic. However, a more realistic model obviously involves a
nucleus of finite-size and relativistic electrons. In this work we have
calculated the finite nuclear-size and relativistic corrections to the Schiff
moment. The relativistic corrections originate from the electron wavefunctions
and are incorporated into a ``nuclear'' moment, which we term the local dipole
moment. For mercury these corrections amount to about 25%. We have found that
the natural generalization of the electrostatic potential of the Schiff moment
for a finite-size nucleus corresponds to an electric field distribution which,
inside the nucleus, is well approximated as constant and directed along the
nuclear spin, and outside the nucleus is zero. Also in this work the plutonium

  versus Average Bound",,,,"MTR 01W0000056","quant-ph",,"  In order to be practically useful, quantum cryptography must not only provide
a guarantee of secrecy, but it must provide this guarantee with a useful,
sufficiently large throughput value. The standard result of generalized privacy
amplification yields an upper bound only on the average value of the mutual
information available to an eavesdropper. Unfortunately this result by itself
is inadequate for cryptographic applications. A naive application of the
standard result leads one to incorrectly conclude that an acceptable upper
bound on the mutual information has been achieved. It is the pointwise value of
the bound on the mutual information, associated with the use of some specific
hash function, that corresponds to actual implementations. We provide a fully
rigorous mathematical derivation that shows how to obtain a cryptographically
acceptable upper bound on the actual, pointwise value of the mutual
information. Unlike the bound on the average mutual information, the value of
the upper bound on the pointwise mutual information and the number of bits by
which the secret key is compressed are specified by two different parameters,
and the actual realization of the bound in the pointwise case is necessarily
associated with a specific failure probability. The constraints amongst these
parameters, and the effect of their values on the system throughput, have not
been previously analyzed. We show that the necessary shortening of the key
dictated by the cryptographically correct, pointwise bound, can still produce
viable throughput rates that will be useful in practice.

  references are added. The notion of the relative error is better motived. The
  proofs are simplified. More explanations",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We propose new optimality criterion for the estimation of state-dependent
cloning. We call this measure the relative error because the one compares the
errors in the copies with contiguous size taking into account the similarity of
states to be copied. A copying transformation and dimension of state space are
not specified. Only the unitarity of quantum mechanical transformations is
used. The presented approach is based on the notion of the angle between two
states. Firstly, several useful statements simply expressed in terms of angles
are proved. Among them there are the spherical triangle inequality and the
inequality establishing the upper bound on the modulus of difference between
probability distributions generated by two any states for an arbitrary
measurement. The tightest lower bound on the relative error is then obtained.
Hillery and Buzek originally examined an approximate state-dependent copying
and obtained the lower bound on the absolute error. We consider relationship
between the size of error and the corresponding probability distributions and
obtain the tightest lower bound on the absolute error. Thus, the proposed
approach supplements and reinforces the results obtained by Hillery and Buzek.
Finally, the basic findings of investigation for the relative error are
discussed.

is the fundamental variable that appears in Schrodinger's equation. In
conventional time-dependent perturbation theory, the state vector must be
calculated before the experimentally-observable expectation values of relevant
operators can be computed. We discuss an alternative form of time-dependent
perturbation theory in which the observable expectation values are calculated
directly and expressed in the form of nested commutators. This result is
consistent with the fact that the commutation relations determine the
properties of a quantum system, while the commutators often have a form that
simplifies the calculation and avoids canceling terms. The usefulness of this
method is illustrated using several problems of interest in quantum optics and
quantum information processing.
