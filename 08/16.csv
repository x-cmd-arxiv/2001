rotationally induced mixing predicts that boron depletions are unaccompanied by

order to explain observations of (young and hot) RX J0822--43 and (old and

to the fact that our predicted PMR relations based on nonlinear, convective

typically accurate at the 5% level. Our evolutionary mass determinations are

surrounded by stably stratified layers with overshooting convection. The
magnetic Reynolds number, Rm, is chosen subcritical, thus excluding spontaneous
growth of the magnetic field through dynamo action, and the magnetic energy is
maintained by introducing a constant magnetic field into the box, once
convection has attained a statistically stationary state. Under the influence
of the Coriolis force, the advection of the magnetic field results in a
non-vanishing contribution to the mean electric field, given by uxb. From this
electric field, we calculate the alpha-effect, separately for the stably and
the unstably stratified layers, by averaging over time and over suitably

the dependence of alpha on rotation and magnetic field strength is studied.
Evidence is found for rotational quenching of the vertical alpha-effect, and
for a monotonic increase of the horizontal alpha-effect with increasing
rotation. For Rm~30, our results for both vertical and horizontal alpha-effect
are consistent with magnetic quenching by a factor 1/[1+Rm(B_0/B_eq)^2]. The
signs of the small-scale current helicity and of the vertical component of
alpha are found to be opposite to those for isotropic turbulence.

models for the formation and evolution of the two populations in cosmological
N-body simulations. We adopt the quasar evolution model of Kauffmann & Haehnelt
(2000), in which supermassive black holes are formed and fuelled during major
mergers. We define the `bias' parameter b_QG as the ratio of the
cross-correlation function xi_QG to the galaxy auto-correlation function xi_GG.
On scales larger than 1 h^{-1} Mpc, the values of b_QG predicted by our models
at low redshift depend very little on galaxy selection. They measure the
characteristic mass of the dark matter halos that host quasars and can be used
to estimate the typical quasar lifetime. In current redshift surveys, such
measurements will constrain the lifetimes of low z quasars more accurately than
measurements of the quasar auto-correlation function, because galaxies have
much higher space densities than quasars. On scales smaller than 1 h^{-1} Mpc,
the main contribution to xi_QG comes from quasar/galaxy pairs in the same dark
matter halo. The amplitude of xi_QG depends both on the location of the host
galaxy and on the density profile of other galaxies within the halo. As a
result, measurements on these scales yield information about the processes
responsible for fuelling super- massive black holes. At high redshifts, our
models predict that quasars of fixed luminosity are located in less massive
halos than at low redshift. They are therefore less biased relative to galaxies
of given luminosity or stellar mass. We have used the simulations to calculate
the evolution of the quasar auto- correlation function. We find that models
with quasar lifetimes in the range 10^6-10^7 years provide a good match to the
results of the 2dF QSO survey.

the rotation profile below the convection zone is constructed along the lines
suggested by Gough & McIntyre and solved numerically. In this first part, a
reduced model of the tachocline is derived in which the effects of
compressibility and energy transport on the system are neglected; the
meridional motions are driven instead by Ekman-Hartmann pumping. It is shown
that there exists only a narrow range of magnetic field strengths for which the
system can achieve a nearly uniform rotation. The results are discussed with
respect to observations and to the limitations of this initial approach. A

re-analyzed in detail the carrier contribution to the Nernst signal. By

summarized in a zero-temperature phase diagram for the degenerate two-component

propagate elastically along moving crack fronts. We find that the theory agrees
plausibly with the orders of magnitude observed. Various consequences and

top of a two-dimensional island -- determines both the conditions for
layer-by-layer growth, and the size of the top terrace of multilayer mounds in
three-dimensional homoepitaxial growth. It was recently shown that conventional
mean field nucleation theory overestimates the rate of second layer nucleation
by a factor that is proportional to the number of times a given site is visited
by an adatom during its residence time on the island. In the presence of strong
step edge barriers this factor can be large, leading to a substantial error in
previous attempts to experimentally determine barrier energies from the onset
of second layer nucleation. In the first part of the paper simple analytic
estimates of second layer nucleation rates based on a comparison of the
relevant time scales will be reviewed. In the main part the theory of second
layer nucleation is applied to the growth of multilayer mounds in the presence
of strong but finite step edge barriers. The shape of the mounds is obtained by
numerical integration of the deterministic evolution of island boundaries,
supplemented by a rule for nucleation in the top layer. For thick films the
shape converges to a simple scaling solution. The scaling function is
parametrized by the coverage $\theta_c$ of the top layer, and takes the form of
an inverse error function cut off at $\theta_c$. The surface width of a film of
thickness $d$ is $\sqrt{(1- \theta_c) d}$. Finally, we show that the scaling
solution can be derived also from a continuum growth equation.

that the real and imaginary parts of \tilde E(x+iy), viewed as functions of x
for fixed y, are the electric and magnetic fields generated by a spinning ring
of charge R. This represents the electromagnetic part of the Kerr-Newman
solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equations. As already pointed out by Newman
and Janis in 1965, this interpretation is somewhat problematic since the fields
are double-valued. To make them single-valued, a branch cut must be introduced
so that R is replaced by a charged disk D having R as its boundary. In the
context of curved spacetime, D becomes a spinning disk of charge and mass
representing the singularity of the Kerr-Newman solution. Here we confirm the
above interpretation of the real and imaginary parts of \tilde E(x+iy) by
computing the charge- and current densities directly as distributions in R^3
supported in the source disk D. This shows in particular that D spins rigidly
at the critical rate, so that its rim R moves at the speed of light.

spacetime dimensions, representing the signal received at the spacetime point
x_r due to an impulse emitted at the spacetime point x_e. Such emission and
reception processes are highly idealized, since no signal can be emitted or
received at a single (mathematical) point in space and time. We present a
simple model for \sl extended \rm emitters and receivers by extending G
analytically to a function \tilde G(z_r- z_e), where z_e=x_e+iy_e is a complex
spacetime point representing a circular \sl pulsed-beam emitting antenna dish
\rm centered at x_e and emitting in the direction of y_e, and z_r=x_r-iy_r
represents a circular \sl pulsed-beam receiving antenna dish \rm centered at
x_r and receiving from the direction of y_r. The holomorphic Green function
\tilde G(z_r-z_e) represents the \sl coupling \rm between the emission from z_e
and the reception at z_r. To preserve causality and give nonsingular coupling,
the orientation vectors y_e and y_r must belong to the \sl future cone \rm V_+
in spacetime. Equivalently, z_e and z_r belong to the \sl future and past tubes
\rm in complex spacetime, respectively. The space coordinates of y_e and y_r
give the spatial orientations and radii of the dishes, while their time
coordinates determine the \sl duration and focus \rm of the emission and
reception processes. The \sl directivity \rm D(y) of the communication process
is a convex function on V_+, i.e., D(y_r+y_e)\le D(y_r)+D(y_r). This shows that
the efficiency of the communication can be no better than the sum of its
emission and reception components.

  Missions for Astrobiology IV conference, part of the SPIE Annual Meeting 2001",,"10.1117/12.454759",,"nlin.AO q-bio",,"  It is suggested that life originated in a three-step process referred to as
the jigsaw model. RNA, proteins, or similar organic molecules polymerized in a
dehydrated carbon-rich environment, on surfaces in a carbon-rich environment,
or in another environment where polymerization occurs. These polymers
subsequently entered an aqueous environment where they folded into compact
structures. It is argued that the folding of randomly generated polymers such
as RNA or proteins in water tends to partition the folded polymer into domains
with hydrophobic cores and matching shapes to minimize energy. In the aqueous
environment, hydrolysis or other reactions fragmented the compact structures
into two or more matching molecules, occasionally producing simple living
systems, also known as autocatalytic sets of molecules. It is argued that the
hydrolysis of folded polymers such as RNA or proteins is not random. The
hydrophobic cores of the domains are rarely bisected due to the energy
requirements in water. Hydrolysis preferentially fragments the folded polymers
into pieces with complementary structures and chemical affinities. Thus the
probability of producing a system of matched, interacting molecules in
prebiotic chemistry is much higher than usually estimated. Environments where
this process may occur are identified. For example, the jigsaw model suggests
life may have originated at a seep of carbonaceous fluids beneath the ocean.
The polymerization occurred beneath the sea floor. The folding and
fragmentation occurred in the ocean. The implications of this hypothesis for
seeking life or prebiotic chemistry in the Solar System are explored.

the claim. We devise algorithms and programs which write down any two-variable
expression in an orthomodular lattice by means of classical and quantum
operations in an identical form. Our results show that lattice structure and
classical operations uniquely determine quantum logic underlying Hilbert space.
As a consequence of our result, recent proposals for a deduction theorem with
quantum operations in an orthomodular lattice as well as a substitution of
quantum operations for the usual standard Hilbert space ones in quantum logic
prove to be misleading. Quantum computer quantum logic is also discussed.

initial state to investigate the existence of pure and mixed Evolutionarily
Stable Strategies (ESS). An example is considered to draw a comparison between
classical and quantum version of the game. Our choice of most general initial
quantum state enables us to make the game symmetric or asymmetric. We show that
for a particular set of game parameters where there exist only mixed ESS in the
classical version of the game, however, quantization allows even a pure
strategy to be an ESS for symmetric game in addition to ixed ESS. On the other
hand only pure strategy ESS can exist for asymmetric quantum version of the
Hawk-Dove game.
