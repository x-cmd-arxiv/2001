observations of x-ray binary source 4U 1820$-$30 located in the globular
cluster NGC 6624. The light curves of observations made between October 1996
and September 1997 show that the maximum of the 685s binary period modulation
folded by the linear ephemeris from previous observations has phase shift of
$-$0.20 $\pm$ 0.06. Combined with historical results (1976-1997), the binary
period derivative is measured to be $\dot P / P =(-3.47 \pm 1.48) \times
10^{-8}$ yr$^{-1}$. The previous known ($\sim$176 d) long-term modulation is
significant in the x-ray light curve obtained by analysis of the RXTE All-Sky
Monitor (ASM) during the years 1996-2000. The RXTE/ASM ephemeris is extended by
analysis of all historical data (Vela 5B and Ginga) to yield a period
171.033$\pm$0.326 days with no evidence for period change ($|{\dot{P}/ {P}}| <
2.20 \times 10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$). All reported x-ray burst activity is confined
to within $\pm$23 d of the predicted minima. This stable long-term modulation
is consistent with 4U 1820$-$30 being a hierarchical triple system with a
$\sim$1.1 d period companion.

narrow continuous ridge. The currently known hard x-ray sources are far too few
to explain the ridge x-ray emission, and the fundamental question as to whether
the ridge emission is ultimately resolved into numerous dimmer discrete sources
or truly diffuse emission has not yet been settled. In order to obtain a
decisive answer, using the Chandra x-ray observatory, we have carried out the
deepest hard x-ray survey of a Galactic plane region which is devoid of known
x-ray point sources. We have detected at least 36 new hard x-ray point sources
in addition to strong diffuse emission within a 17' x 17' field of view. The
surface density of the point sources is comparable to that at high Galactic
latitudes after the effects of Galactic absorption are considered. Therefore,
most of these point sources are probably extragalactic, presumably active
galaxies seen through the Galactic disk. The Galactic ridge hard x-ray emission
is diffuse, which indicates omnipresence of the hot plasma along the Galactic
plane whose energy density is more than one order of magnitude higher than any
other substances in the interstellar space.

very large disagreement with others (Alibert et al. 1999). The large
differences between the models are likely caused by the very high sensitivity
of stellar evolution during core helium burning phase to even small changes in

that in certain commensurate sectors one can construct non-abelian subalgebras
which are translation invariant and supercommute with the transfer matrix and
therefore with all charges of the model. In the line of argument we introduce
the restricted quantum superalgebra $U^{res}_q(\hat g)$ and investigate its

of arbitrary powers of the Chevalley-Serre generators and derive higher order
quantum Serre relations as well as an analogue of Lustzig's quantum Frobenius

mimimum Compton wavelength, or quantum of space), noting that some of these
lead to a trans-Planckian branch where energy increases with decreasing
momenta. This feature translates into negative radiation pressure and, in
well-defined circumstances, into an inflationary equation of state. We thus
realize the inflationary scenario without the aid of an inflaton field. As the
radiation cools down below the Planck temperature, inflation gracefully exits
into a standard Big Bang universe, dispensing with a period of reheating.
Thermal fluctuations in the radiation bath will in this case generate curvature
fluctuations on cosmological scales whose amplitude and spectrum can be tuned
to agree with observations.

discrete symmetries P, T and PT, represented by fundamental automorphisms of
the Clifford algebras, are defined on all the representation spaces. Real,
complex, quaternionic and octonionic representations of the Lorentz group are
considered. Physical fields of the different types are formulated within such
representations. The Atiyah-Bott-Shapiro periodicity is defined on the Lorentz
group. It is shown that modulo 2 and modulo 8 periodicities of the Clifford
algebras allow to take a new look at the de Broglie-Jordan neutrino theory of
light and the Gell-Mann-Ne'emann eightfold way in particle physics. On the
representation spaces the charge conjugation C is represented by a
pseudoautomorphism of the complex Clifford algebra. Quotient representations of
the Lorentz group are introduced. It is shown that quotient representations are
the most suitable for description of the massless physical fields. By way of
example, neutrino field is described via the simplest quotient representation.
