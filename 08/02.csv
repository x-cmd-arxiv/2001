the behavior of H during BBN and derive constraints on this parameter space,
finding that the allowed region of parameter space is essentially
one-dimensional. We also study the effects of a large neutrino asymmetry within
this framework. Our results provide a simple way to compare an alternative
cosmology to the observational requirement of matching the primordial

variability in the optical light curve that could represent gravitational
lensing (Garnavich, Loeb, and Stanek 2000, ApJ 544, L11). X-ray light curves of

responsible for the rich phenomenology of the NGC 1275 system -- NGC 1275
experienced a recent merger/interaction with a group of gas-rich galaxies, and
recent outflows from its AGN have compressed the intracluster gas, and perhaps
the gas in the infalling galaxies, to produce a complex web of filaments.

associations indicate that most nearby molecular clouds form stars only over a
short time span before dispersal; large-scale flows in the diffuse interstellar
medium have the potential for forming clouds sufficiently rapidly, and for
producing stellar populations with ages much less than the lateral crossing
times of their host molecular clouds. We identify four important factors for
understanding rapid star formation and short cloud lifetimes. First, much of
the accumulation and dispersal of clouds near the solar circle might occur in
the atomic phase; only the high-density portion of a cloud's lifecycle is spent
in the molecular phase, thus helping to limit molecular cloud ``lifetimes''.
Second, once a cloud achieves a high enough column density to form $\h2$ and
CO, gravitational forces become larger than typical interstellar pressure
forces; thus star formation can follow rapidly upon molecular gas formation and
turbulent dissipation in limited areas of each cloud complex. Third, typical
magnetic fields are not strong enough to prevent rapid cloud formation and
gravitational collapse. Fourth, rapid dispersal of gas by newly-formed stars,
and reduction of shielding by a small expansion of the cloud after the first
events of star formation, might limit the length of the star formation epoch
and the lifetime of a cloud in its molecular state. This picture emphasizes the
importance of large-scale boundary conditions for understanding molecular cloud
formation, and implies that star formation is a highly dynamic, rather than
quasi-static, process.

non-baryonic) and 70% in the form of `dark energy'. These two densities,
together with the Hubble constant (estimated to be about 70 km/s/Mpc),
constrain the age of the Universe to be approximately 13 Gyr. This expansion
age is uncomfortably close to the age of the oldest globular clusters
(approximately 12.5 Gyr), in particular if they formed relatively recently. We
review here proposed models of globular cluster formation and point out
possible conflicts with cosmology.

cylinder there is a well-known characteristic Reynolds number even without
magnetic field but for sufficiently weak magnetic fields there are solutions
with smaller Reynolds numbers so that a characteristic minimum exists. The

small magnetic Prandtl numbers one only finds the typical magnetic suppression
of the instability.
  We are here particularly interested in the case where the outer cylinder
rotates so fast that the Rayleigh criterion for hydrodynamic stability is
fulfilled. We find that for given magnetic Prandtl number now always a magnetic
field amplitude exists where the characteristic Reynolds number is minimal.
These critical values are computed for different magnetic Prandtl numbers. In
all cases the Reynolds numbers are running with 1/Pm so that for the small

optical/IR spectral energy distribution which is strongly reddened by dust
(L_FIR/L_B<~200; A_V~5). The narrow emission lines (~300km/s) and the high

galaxy. Assuming that star formation dominates, we constrain the SFR to be
10-700Mo/yr from a variety of indicators. We compare EROJ164023 with the only
other spectroscopically identified dusty EROs: HR10 (z=1.44) and ISOJ1324-2016
(z=1.50). EROJ164023 and HR10 have similar disk-like morphologies, and both
exhibit a variation in the apparent dust obscuration depending upon the
diagnostic used, suggesting that there is a complex spatial mix of stellar
populations and dust in these galaxies. In contrast, the compact morphology and
spectral properties of ISOJ1324-2016 indicate that it is a dusty quasar. Our
results demonstrate that dusty galaxies identified using photometric ERO
criteria include pure starbursts, composite systems such as EROJ164023 and

previous optical CMDs of NGC 2808 show a high temperature gap within the hot HB
population, no such gap is evident in our UV CMD. Instead, we find a population
of hot subluminous HB stars, an anomaly only previously reported for the
globular cluster omega Cen. Our modeling indicates that the location of these
subluminous stars in the UV CMD, as well as the high temperature gap along the
HB in optical CMDs, can be explained if these stars underwent a late He-core
flash while descending the white dwarf cooling curve. We show that the
convection zone produced by such a late He flash will penetrate into the H
envelope, thereby mixing H into the hot He-burning interior, where it is
rapidly consumed. This phenomenon is analogous to the ""born again"" scenario for
producing H-deficient stars following a late He-shell flash. The flash mixing
of the envelope greatly enhances the envelope He and C abundances, and leads,
in turn, to a discontinuous increase in the HB effective temperatures at the
transition between canonical and flash-mixed stars. We argue that the hot HB
gap is associated with this theoretically predicted dichotomy in the HB
properties. Moreover, the changes in the emergent spectral energy distribution
caused by these abundance changes are primarily responsible for explaining the
hot subluminous HB stars. Although further evidence is needed to confirm that a
late He-core flash can account for the subluminous HB stars and the hot HB gap,
we demonstrate that an understanding of these stars requires the use of
appropriate theoretical models for their evolution, atmospheres, and spectra.

In this article, we will rederive the coherent scattering formalism, accounting
for the changes brought about by the spin-orbit coupling. After a short review
of the features of spin-orbit coupling in two-dimensional electron gases, we
define the creation/annihilaton operators in the stationary states of the

within the Landauer-Buettiker formalism. The current is expressed as it is in
the standard spin-independent case, but with the spin label replaced by a new
label which we call the spin-orbit coupling label. The spin-orbit coupling
effects can then be represented in a scattering matrix which relates the
spin-orbit coupling stationary states in different leads. This scattering
matrix is calculated in the case of a four-port beamsplitter, and it is shown
to mix states with different spin-orbit coupling labels in a manner that
depends on the angle between the leads. The formalism is then used to calculate
the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the current and noise in two examples of

Such higher-order correlation functions have attracted much interest recently
in the context of various forms of multi-dimensional spectroscopy, and have
found an intriguing application as proposed measures of dynamical
heterogeneities in structural glasses. The theoretical formalism is based upon
projection operator techniques which are used to isolate the slow time
evolution of dynamical variables by expanding the slowly-evolving component of
arbitrary variables in an infinite, ``multi-linear'' basis composed of the
products of slow variables of the system. Using the formalism, a formally exact
mode coupling theory is derived for multi-point and multi-time correlation
functions. The resulting expressions for higher-order correlation functions are
made tractable by applying a rigorous perturbation scheme, called the
N-ordering method, which is exact for systems with finite correlation lengths
in the thermodynamic limit. The theory is contrasted with standard mode
coupling theories in which the noise or fluctuating force appearing in the
generalized Langevin equation is assumed to be Gaussian, and it is demonstrated
that the non-Gaussian nature of the fluctuating forces leads to important
contributions to higher-order correlation functions. Finally, the higher-order
correlation functions are evaluated analytically for an ideal gas system for
which it is shown that the mode coupling theory is exact.

find stochastic evolution equations for the wave functions $\phi_{1,2}$ such

over noise. In this way, the thermal equilibrium density operator can be
obtained for any temperature $T$. The method is then applied to study the
thermodynamical properties of a homogeneous one-dimensional $N$-boson system:
although Bose-Einstein condensation can not occur in the thermodynamical limit,
a macroscopic occupation of the lowest mode of a finite system is observed at
sufficiently low temperatures. If $k_B T \gg \mu$, the main effect of
interactions is to suppress density fluctuations and to reduce their
correlation length. Different effects such as a spatial antibunching of the

We concentrate on the process (e- gamma -> selectronR gravitino) as a probe of
supersymmetry, where a single heavy superpartner and a superlight gravitino are
produced. The fact that there is only one heavy superpartner in the final state
in this process would require a lower center-of-mass energy for on-shell
production compared to conventional pair production. For instance, for a 500
GeV machine, we find that a positive signal will be found if the supersymmetry
breaking scale is less than about 2 TeV. If no positive signal is found, this
process puts a bound on the supersymmetry breaking scale.

We study three typical quintessence models : (1) an inverse-power-law

($k$-essence) model. With an inverse power law potential model ($V(\phi) = \mu
^{\alpha + 4} \phi^{- \alpha}$), we show that in the quadratic dominant stage,
the density parameter of a scalar field $\Omega_\phi$ decreases as
$a^{-4(\alpha-2)/(\alpha+2)}$ for $2<\alpha < 6$, which is followed by the
conventional quintessence scenario. This feature provides us wider initial
conditions for a successful quintessence. In fact, even if the universe is
initially in a scalar-field dominant, it eventually evolves into a radiation
dominant era in the $\rho^2$-dominant stage.
  Assuming an equipartition condition, we discuss constraints on parameters,
resulting that $\alpha\geq 4$ is required. This constraint also restricts the
value of the 5-dimensional Planck mass, e.g. $4 \times 10^{-14}m_4 \lsim m_5
\lsim 3 \times 10^{-13}m_4$ for $\alpha=5$. For an exponential potential model
$V=\mu^4\exp(-\lambda \phi/m_4)$, we may not find a natural and successful
quintessence scenario as it is. While, for a kinetic-term quintessence, we find
a tracking solution even in $\rho^2$-dominant stage, rather than the
$\Omega_\phi$-decreasing solution for an inverse-power-law potential. Then we
do find a little advantage in a brane world. Only the density parameter
increases more slowly in the $\rho^2$-dominant stage, which provides a wider
initial condition for a successful quintessence.
