candidate brown dwarfs listed by the infrared spectroscopy, we find X-ray
emission from 7 sources above 99.9% confidence level. Therefore ~40% of the
infrared-selected brown dwarfs in this cloud emit X-rays. For the brightest 4
sources, the X-ray spectra are made and are fitted with a thin-thermal plasma
model of a temperature 1-2.5 keV. The X-rays are also time variable with rapid
flares from 2 of the brown dwarfs. Assuming 2 keV temperature and using the
empirical relation of Av vs. NH, we estimate the X-ray luminosity or its upper
limit of the other faint or non-X-ray sources. The X-ray luminosity (Lx) of the
X-ray-detected sources is in the range of 0.3-90x10^28 ergs s^-1, while the
luminosity ratio of X-ray to bolometric (Lx/Lbol) is 10^-3 - 10^-5, similar to
those of low-mass pre-main-sequence and dMe stars. All these results suggest
that the X-ray origin of brown dwarfs is the same as low-mass stars; strong
magnetic activity at the stellar surface.

processes which are short lived, typically ~ 10 to 100 s. There are some low
mass X-ray binaries (LMXB) like 4U 1820-30, 4U 1636-53, KS 1731-260 and Serpens
X-1, known as Super Bursters (SB) which emit X-rays close to the Eddington
luminosity limit for long periods of several hours. Recently there are reports
of some long bursters (LB), which have bursts lasting 6-25 minutes, whereas the
4U 1735-44 has a burst period of 86 minutes. We suggest that these bursts from
SB and LB may be due to breaking and re-formation of diquark pairs, on the
surface of realistic strange quark stars. We use the beta equilibrated u, d and
s quark model of Dey et al. (1998) and Li et al. (1999a and 1999b) and allow
for spin dependent hyperfine interaction between quarks. The interaction
produces pairing of specific colour-spin diquarks, leading to further lowering
of energy by several MeV-s for each pair, on the average. Diquarks are expected
to break up due to the explosion and shock of the TN process. The subsequent
production of copious diquark pairing may produce sufficient energy to produce
the very long bursts seen in SB or LB. The estimated total energy liberated,
10^{42} ergs, can be explained in our model with the calculated pair density ~
0.275/fm^3 and a surface thickness of only half a micron, if the entire surface
is involved. The depth of the surface involved in the process may be only few
microns if the process is restricted to small part of the surface near the
equator as suggested by Bildsten.

luminous mergers. The Medusa L_FIR/L_CO ratio rivals that of ultraluminous
galaxies (ULIRGs), despite the comparatively modest luminosity, indicating an
exceptionally high star formation efficiency (SFE). We present models of the
high pressure ISM in a ULIRG and the relatively low pressure ISM of the Medusa.
We discuss how these models may explain large R in both types of distributions.
Since the HCN emission is faint towards the Medusa, we suggest that the SFE is
not primarily controlled by the mass fraction of dense (n > 10^4 cm-3) gas, but
is probably strongly dependent on dynamics. The bright HCN emission towards
ULIRGs is not necessarily evidence that the IR emission there is always powered
by starbursts.

the accretion flow: a higher angular momentum flow, which forms the disk, and a
lower angular momentum flow feeding the hot inner region. Thus, we argue that
the onset of the outburst is determined by an increased mass transfer rate from
the companion star, but the outburst morphology is also determined by the
distribution of specific angular momentum in the accreting matter. In XTE
J1550-564, we attribute the initial, impulsive low angular momentum accretion
to the breaking down of magnetic confinement by the magnetically active

shedding limit (appearance of a cusp on the surface of the less massive star).
For synchronized binaries, this contrasts with the equal mass case, where the
sequences terminate instead by a contact configuration. Regarding the turning
point of the total angular momentum (or total energy) along a sequence, we find
that it is difficult to get it for small mass ratios. Indeed, we do not find
any turning points for $M_1/M_2 \le 0.5$ in the irrotational case. However, in
the synchronized case, it becomes easier again to find one for mass ratios much

driving force on the velocity gradient. Since Gayley-Owocki heating deposits
heat directly to the absorbing ions, we also investigated the possibility that
individual components of the radiatively driven stellar wind have different
temperatures. This effect is negligible in the wind of O stars, whereas a
significant temperature difference takes place in the winds of main sequence B
stars for stars cooler than B2. Typical temperature difference between
absorbing ions and other flow components for such stars is of the order 10^3 K.
However, in the case when passive component falls back onto the star the
absorbing component reaches temperatures of order 10^6 K, which allows for
emission of X-rays.
  Moreover, we compare our computed terminal velocities with the observed ones.

velocities. The systematic difference coming from the using of the so called

inflationary gravitational wave amplitude. Even with modest surveys, both types
of lensing power spectra break CMB degeneracies and they can ultimately improve
constraints on the dark energy equation of state w by over an order of
magnitude. In its cross correlation with the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, CMB
lensing offers a unique opportunity for a more direct detection of the dark
energy and enables study of its clustering properties. By obtaining source
redshifts and cross-correlations with CMB lensing, cosmic shear surveys provide
tomographic handles on the evolution of clustering correspondingly better
precision on the dark energy equation of state and density. Both can indirectly
provide detections of the reionization optical depth and modest improvements in
gravitational wave constraints which we compare to more direct constraints.
Conversely, polarization B-mode contamination from CMB lensing, like any other
residual foreground, darkens the prospects for ultra-high precision on
gravitational waves through CMB polarization requiring large areas of sky for
statistical subtraction. To evaluate these effects we provide fitting formula
for the evolution and transfer function of the Newtonian gravitational

surrounded by superconductor. At energies below the superconducting gap,
single-quasiparticle excitations are confined to the normal region and its
vicinity, the essential mechanism for this confinement being Andreev
reflection. This Paper develops and implements a theoretical framework for the
investigation of the short-wave quantal properties of these
single-quasiparticle excitations. The focus is primarily on the relationship
between the quasiparticle energy eigenvalue spectrum and the geometrical shape
of the normal-state region, i.e., the question of spectral geometry in the
novel setting of excitations confined by a superconducting pair-potential.
Among the central results of this investigation are two semiclassical trace
formulas for the density of states. The first, a lower-resolution formula,
corresponds to the well-known quasiclassical approximation, conventionally
invoked in settings involving superconductivity. The second, a
higher-resolution formula, allows the density of states to be expressed in
terms of: (i) An explicit formula for the level density, valid in the
short-wave limit, for billiards of arbitrary shape and dimensionality. This
level density depends on the billiard shape only through the set of
stationary-length chords of the billiard and the curvature of the boundary at
the endpoints of these chords; and (ii) Higher-resolution corrections to the
level density, expressed as a sum over periodic orbits that creep around the
billiard boundary. Owing to the fact that these creeping orbits are much longer
than the stationary chords, one can, inter alia, hear the stationary chords of
Andreev billiards.

states have a maximum occupation number of one, whereas the occupation number
for bosonic states is in principle unlimited. For bosons that are made up of
fermions, one could ask the question to what extent the Pauli principle for the
constituent fermions would limit the boson occupation number. Intuitively one
can expect the maximum occupation number to be proportional to the available
volume for the bosons divided by the volume occupied by the fermions inside one
boson, though a rigorous derivation of this result has not been given before.
In this letter we show how the maximum occupation number can be calculated from
the ground-state energy of a fermionic generalized pairing problem. A very
accurate analytical estimate of this eigenvalue is derived. From that a general
expression is obtained for the maximum occupation number of a composite boson
state, based solely on the intrinsic fermionic structure of the bosons. The
consequences for Bose-Einstein condensates of excitons in semiconductors and
ultra cold trapped atoms are discussed.

that is larger than any Dirac mass makes the neutrino not a Majorana but a
""pseudo-Majorana"" particle that has no definite chirality and therefore has a
different phenomenology than the physical neutrino. A combination of a large
Majorana and Dirac mass of nearly equal value makes the neutrino a Majorana
neutrino. However if this Majorana neutrino has SM interactions, its weak
transition amplitudes squared are a factor 2 smaller than the ones observed for
the physical neutrino. Only with a small Dirac mass that is larger than any

allowed only for moderate values of the D-term, if very precise ($\le$ 5%)
unification is required. Next we constrain the parameter space by looking for
different dangerous directions where the scalar potential may be unbounded from
below (UFB1 and UFB3). The common trilinear coupling $A_0$ plays a significant
role in constraing the APS. For very precise $t - b - \tau$ Yukawa unification,
$-m_{16} < or \approx A_0 < or \approx m_{16}$ can be probed at the LHC, where
$m_{16}$ is the common soft breaking mass for the sfermions. Moreover, an
interesting mass hierarchy with very heavy sfermions but light gauginos, which
is strongly disfavoured in models without D-terms, becomes fairly common in the
presence of the D-terms. The APS exhibits interesting characteristics if
$m_{16}$ is not the same as the soft breaking mass $m_{10}$ for the Higgs
sector. In $b - \tau$ unification models with D-terms, the APS consistent with

the UFB1 constraint becomes weaker. However for $A_0 \leq 0$, a stronger UFB3
condition still puts, for a given $m_{16}$, a stringent upper bound on the
common gaugino mass ($m_{1/2}$) and a lower bound on $m_{16}$ for a given

crucial role on the GUT breaking. In this paper, we show that the full
