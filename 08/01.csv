(2001), this survey covers ~260 arcmin^2 using the sub-millimetre camera SCUBA,
to a limiting source detection limit S(850um) ~ 8 mJy. One advantage of this
relatively bright flux-density limit is that accurate astrometric positions are
potentially achievable for every source using existing radio and/or mm-wave
interferometers. However, an associated advantage is that SED-based redshift
constraints should be more powerful than in fainter sub-mm surveys. Here we
therefore exploit the parallel SCUBA 450um data, in combination with existing
radio and ISO data at longer and shorter wavelengths to set constraints on the
redshift of each source. We also analyse new and existing optical and
near-infrared imaging of our SCUBA survey fields to select potential
identifications consistent with these constraints. Our derived SED-based
redshift constraints, and the lack of statistically significant associations
with even moderately bright galaxies allow us to conclude that all 19 sources
lie at z > 1, and at least half of them apparently lie at z > 2.

sample consists of a statistically complete flat-spectrum subset of 32 AGNs
from the Pearson-Readhead survey, which has been studied at a variety of
wavelengths and resolutions, including space-VLBI. Our observations were made
with the VLBA at 43 GHz, where the relatively higher resolution and weaker
opacity effects have allowed us to probe magnetic field structures in the jets
of these AGNs much closer to the central engine than in previous studies. At 43
GHz, the bulk of the total intensity and polarized emission in most
flat-spectrum AGNs originates from an unresolved core component located at the
extreme end of a faint jet. The luminosity of the core is positively correlated
with the total source luminosity in soft x-rays, in the optical, and at 5 GHz.
The most strongly polarized cores display electric vectors that are roughly
aligned with the jet axis, which is consistent with a strong transverse shock
that enhances the perpendicular component of the jet magnetic field. Sources
with highly polarized cores also tend to have high optical polarizations and
flatter overall radio spectra. Approximately half of the jets in our sample
display apparently bent morphologies that are suggestive of streaming motions
along a helical path. The straightest jets in the sample tend to display slower
superluminal speeds than those that are significantly bent. We also confirm
that intrinsic differences in the magnetic field properties of BL Lacertae
objects and quasars previously seen on scales of tens of milliarcseconds are
also present in regions much closer to the base of the jet.

astrophysical maser radiation due to the Zeeman effect under idealized

spectral linebreadth and when radiative saturation is significant. The
description of the circular polarization, as well as inferences about the
magnetic field from the observations, are clearest when the rate for stimulated
emission is much less than the Zeeman splitting. The calculations here are
performed in this regime, which is relevant for some (if not most) observations
of astrophysical masers. We demonstrate that Stokes-$V$ is proportional to the
Zeeman splitting and the fractional linear polarization is independent of the
Zeeman splitting when the ratio of the Zeeman splitting to the spectral line
breadth is small---less than about 0.1. In contrast to its behavior for
ordinary spectral lines, the circular polarization for masers that are at least
partially saturated does not decrease with increasing angle between the
magnetic field and the line-of-sight until they are nearly perpendicular.

luminosity generated by accretion onto primordial compact objects. We show that
if such objects generate enough luminosity to affect the CMB power spectrum,
then they would produce enough heat to prevent the formation of 1 sigma

harmonic transform of the two-point correlation function. First, we study
statistical properties of the bispectrum and the normalized bispectrum. We find
the latter more useful for statistical analysis; the distribution of the
normalized bispectrum is very much Gaussian, while the bare bispectrum
distribution is highly non-Gaussian. Then, we measure 466 modes of the
normalized bispectrum, all independent combinations of three-point
configurations up to a maximum multipole of 20, the mode corresponding to the
DMR beam size. By measuring 10 times as many modes as the sum of previous work,
we test Gaussianity of the DMR maps. We compare the data with the simulated
Gaussian realizations, finding no significant detection of the normalized
bispectrum on the mode-by-mode basis. We also find that the previously reported
detection of the normalized bispectrum is consistent with a statistical
fluctuation. By fitting a theoretical prediction to the data for the primary
CMB bispectrum, which is motivated by slow-roll inflation, we put a weak
constraint on a parameter characterizing non-linearity in inflation.
Simultaneously fitting the foreground bispectra estimated from interstellar
dust and synchrotron template maps shows that neither dust nor synchrotron
emissions significantly contribute to the bispectrum at high Galactic latitude.

spatial correlation function xi(r) = (r/r0)^{-1.8} from A_omega using the
redshift distribution of LBGs derived from the HDFN, and find r0=2.7
(+0.5/-0.6) h^{-1} Mpc in a Lambda-dominated universe (Omega_m=0.3 and
Omega_Lambda=0.7). This is twice larger than the correlation length of the dark
matter at z~4 predicted from an analytic model by Peacock & Dodds but about
twice smaller than that of bright galaxies predicted by a semi-analytic model
of Baugh et al. We find an excess of omega(theta) on small scales (theta < 5'')
departing from the power law fit over 3 sigma significance levels. Interpreting
this as due to galaxy mergers, we estimate the fraction of galaxies undergoing
mergers in our LBG sample to be 3.0 +/- 0.9%, which is significantly smaller
than those of galaxies at intermediate redshifts.

the atmosphere rotates rigidly is a factor of two to three less than the
observed values. If differential rotation is allowed to persist, we find that
the upper layers of the atmosphere spin down by an amount comparable to the
observed values; however, there is no compelling reason to expect the observed
spin frequency to be that of only the outermost layers. We conclude that
hydrostatic expansion and angular momentum conservation alone cannot account
for the largest frequency shifts observed during Type I bursts.

galaxies to the amplitude and shape of their dark matter halos. Early imaging
and spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey are used to make weak
lensing measurements of the surface mass density contrast Delta Sigma_+ around
classes of lens objects. This surface mass density contrast as a function of
radius is a measure of the galaxy-mass correlation function (GMCF). Because
spectroscopic redshifts are available for all lens objects, the mass and
distance scales are well constrained. The GMCF measured around ~31,000 lenses
is well fit by a power law of the form
  Delta Sigma_+ = (2.5+0.7-0.6) (R/1 Mpc)^{-0.8+-0.2} h M_sun pc^-2.
  We compare this GMCF to galaxy luminosity, type, and environment, and find
that it varies strongly with all three. We quantify these variations by
comparing the normalization of a fit to the inner 260 h^-1 kpc, M_260, to the
galaxy luminosity. While M_260 is not strongly related to luminosity in bluest
band u', there is a simple, linear relation between M_260 and luminosity in
redder bands (g', r', i', and z'). We test the universality of these
mass-to-light scalings by independently measuring them for spiral and
elliptical galaxies,and for galaxies in a variety of environments. We find
remarkable consistency in these determinations in the red bands, especially i'
and z'. This consistency across a wide range of systems suggests that the
measured scaling represents an excellent cosmic average, and that the
integrated star formation history of galaxies is strongly related to the dark
matter environments in which they form.

  2001",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The COMPTEL observations of the diffuse galactic 1.809 MeV emission
attributed to the radioactive decay of 26Al have confirmed the diffuse nature
of this interstellar emission line. One of the most significant features of the
reconstructed intensity pattern is a flux enhancement in the direction of the
Cygnus region. This region is fairly young and contains a wealth of massive
stars, most of them grouped in the Cygnus OB associations. Multi-frequency
model fitting strongly supports the hypothesis of massive stars and their
descendent supernovae being the dominant sources of interstellar 26Al as
observed by COMPTEL.
  Massive stars and supernovae are known to impart a large amount of kinetic
energy into the surrounding ISM which lead to shockregions and large cavities.
In addition, a large fraction of the electro-magnetic radiation of massive
stars lies in the extreme ultra-violet causing photoionisation of the
surrounding interstellar medium.
  We applied a population synthesis model in combination with an analytic model
of the expansion of superbubbles to the Cygnus OB associations. The model
predicts the expected 1.809 MeV flux and the gamma-ray line intensity due to
interstellar 60Fe. We compute the sizes and expansion parameters of the
expected HI-structures and the free-free emission intensities due to the
photoionizing radiation from massive stars within this region of the sky. We
discuss our present understanding of the Cygnus region with respect to the
massive star census and history. Our model assigns about 70% of the 1.809 MeV

roughly 10% to an unkown diffuse component.

scattered light in near-IR imaging polarimetry observations. Here, we subtract
the contribution of the unpolarized stellar light to obtain an intrinsic linear
polarization of between 30 and 40 per cent in the shell which seems to increase
with radial offset from the star. The J and K band data are modelled using a
scattering code to determine the shell parameters and dust properties. We find
that the observations are well described by a spherically symmetric
distribution of dust with an inverse square density law, indicating that when
mass-loss was occurring, the mass-loss rate was constant. The models predict
that the detached nature of a spherically symmetric, optically thin dust shell,
with a distinct inner boundary, will only be apparent in polarized flux. This
is in accordance with the observations of this and other optically thin
circumstellar shells, such as IRAS 17436+5003. By fitting the shell brightness
we derive an optical depth to the star which is consistent with V band
observations and which, assuming a distance of 6 kpc, gives an inner shell
radius of 1.44 X 10^{15} m, a dust number density of 2.70 X 10^{-1} m^{-3}. and
a dust mass of 0.08 Msun. We have explored axisymmetric shell models but
conclude that any deviations from spherical symmetry in the shell must be
slight, with an equator-to-pole density contrast of less than 2:1. We have not
been able to simultaneously fit the high linear polarizations and the small
(E(J-K)=-0.3) colour excess of the shell and we attribute this to the unusual
scattering properties of the dust. We suggest that the dust grains around HD
179821 are either highly elongated or consist of aggregates of smaller
particles.

outburst and during a transition from quiescence to another outburst.
  At the beginning of the transition the X-ray count rate was an order of
magnitude higher and the spectrum much harder than during the outburst. As the
transition progressed, the spectrum remained hard as the X-ray flux decreased
by a factor of 3, with no spectral softening. Spectral modelling reveals an
optically-thin, high-temperature component (kT$\approx$10 keV) which dominates
the transition observation and is also observed during outburst. This is
expected from material accreting onto the white dwarf surface. The outburst
spectra require additional emission at lower temperatures, either through an
additional discrete temperature component, or a combination of a cooling flow
model and an ionised absorber.
  Fits to both observations show large amounts of absorption
($N_H=8-9\times10^{21}$cm$^{-2}$), two orders of magnitude greater than the
measured interstellar value, and consistent with UV measurements of the
outburst. This suggests that a disk wind is present even in the earliest stages
of outburst, possibly before the outburst heating wave has reached the boundary
layer.

model for the vanadium layers we derive an effective low-energy model
consisting of pseudospin Ising chains and Heisenberg chains coupled to each
other. We find a ``spin-Peierls-Ising'' phase transition which causes charge
ordering on every second ladder and superexchange alternation on the other
ladders. This transition can be identified with the first transition of the two
closeby transitions observed in experiment. Due to charge ordering the
effective coupling between the lattice and the superexchange is enhanced. This
is demonstrated within a Slater-Koster approximation. It leads to a second
instability with superexchange alternation on the charge-ordered ladders due to
an alternating shift of the O sites on the rungs of that ladder. We can explain
within our model the observed spin gap, the anomalous BCS ratio, and the
anomalous shift of the critical temperature of the first transition in a
magnetic field. To test the calculated superstructure we determine the
low-energy magnon dispersion and find agreement with experiment.

violation scheme by including tan(beta) -enhanced large contributions beyond
the leading order. In this analysis, we take into account the relevant
cosmological and collider bounds, as well as electric dipole moment
constraints. In the unconstrained model, there are portions of the parameter
space yielding a large CP asymmetry at leading order (LO). In these regions, we
find that the CP phases satisfy certain sum rules, e.g., the sum of the phases
of the \mu parameter and the stop trilinear coupling centralize around \pi with
a width determined by the experimental bounds. In addition, at large values of
tan(beta), the sign of the CP asymmetry tracks the sign of the gluino mass, and
the CP asymmetry is significantly larger than the LO prediction. In the
constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model based on minimal
supergravity, we find that the decay rate is sensitive to the phase of the
universal trilinear coupling. This sensitivity decreases at large values of the
universal gauino mass. We also show that for a given set of the mass
parameters, there exists a threshold value of the phase of the universal
trilinear coupling which grows with tan(beta) and beyond which the experimental
bounds are satisfied. In both supersymmetric scenarios, the allowed ranges of
the CP phases are wide enough to have phenomenological consequences.

factoring large integers, simulating quantum systems, and database searching.
Using a photon as a quantum bit (qubit) is one of the most promising ways to
realize a universal quantum computer because the coherent superposition state
of a photon is very robust against various sources of decoherence. However, it
is too difficult to realize two-qubit (photon) gates because it requires huge
nonlinearity between photons. Here we show the realization of a controlled-NOT
(CNOT) gate, the most important and elemental two-qubit gate for quantum
computation, by extending our previous research. The heart of our experiment is
the conditional measurement of two-photon coincidences in the Franson-type
experiment[7]. The photon counting measurement plays the same role as the
nonlinearity required for the two-qubit gate, and our system reproduces the
truth table of the CNOT gate. Furthermore, we create an entangled state from
the superposition state by our gate, which is clear evidence that our gate
works as a quantum logic gate. Our results make it possible to manipulate the
quantum state of photons including entanglement and represent significant
progress in the operation of various algorithms in quantum computation.

"quant-ph/0108002","Ulrich Mohrhoff","Ulrich Mohrhoff","Two theories of decoherence","12 pages, LaTeX2e",,,"SAAPS 010721","quant-ph",,"  Theories of decoherence come in two flavors---Platonic and Aristotelian.
Platonists grant ontological primacy to the concepts and mathematical symbols
by which we describe or comprehend the physical world. Aristotelians grant it
to the physical world. The significance one attaches to the phenomenon of
decoherence depends on the school to which one belongs. The debate about the
significance of quantum states has for the most part been carried on between
Platonists and Kantians, who advocate an epistemic interpretation, with
Aristotelians caught in the crossfire. For the latter, quantum states are
neither states of Nature nor states of knowledge. The real issue is not the
kind of reality that we should attribute to quantum states but the reality of
the spatial and temporal distinctions that we make. Once this is recognized,
the necessity of attributing ontological primacy to facts becomes obvious, the
Platonic stance becomes inconsistent, and the Kantian point of view becomes
unnecessarily restrictive and unilluminating.

resonances. Our investigations take place in the context of a system of
ultracold atoms which is coupled to its environment via spontaneous emission
decoherence, and the effects should be realisable in ongoing experiments.

extensions of the quantum coin toss in the one-dimensional walk simulation, and
other illustrative transformations are also investigated. We find that
entanglement between the dimensions serves to reduce the rate of spread of the
quantum walk. The classical limit is obtained by introducing a random phase
variable.

waveguide structure we can analytically calculate the atomic AC Stark shift and
the modifications of the light field induced by the presence of the atom. A
large enhancement of the effective interaction strength is found due to a non
uniform mode density. Experimentally this should be visible by monitoring the
scattered light field as well as by the modification of the atomic trajectories
bouncing from the evanescent light.
