low and high ionization. This component has a low filling factor, and is
photoionized by X-rays from the shock. The intermediate component, which is
dominated by newly processed oxygen, originates in a shell with velocity of
2500-5000 km/s, and most likely comes from the ejecta. The hydrogen- and
helium-dominated gas has a low ionization, a high density, and velocities that
extend out to ~10,000 km/s. Strong signatures of Ly-alpha-pumped fluorescence
lines of Fe II are seen in the near-infrared and ultraviolet. The He/H ratio, ~
0.3 by number, and the nitrogen overabundance provide strong evidence for CNO
burning products. The fluxes of the broad hydrogen and helium lines decrease
considerably faster than the oxygen lines. The H-alpha line profile shows
strong evolution, with the red wing decreasing faster than the blue. Possible

the source is softer than spectra of magnetospheric radiation of

for the density profiles along the semi-major axis and the semi-minor axis
(re-scaled to semi-major axis units, using the ellipticity of the galaxy) of
Draco. There are hence no evidences of a tidal-tail associated to Draco. The
tidal radius of the galaxy is found to be r_t~42' (~1 kpc). The possibility
that the large mass-to-light relation in Draco could be accounted for by a
convenient spatial orientation is rejected, which implies that other mechanisms
(e.g., dark matter) are required.
  The stellar population of Draco is mainly old. Although some intermediate-age
population is present in Draco, most of the star formation (up to 90%) took
place before ~10 Gyr ago. No significant star formation activity is detected in
the last ~2 Gyr. Two methods (""partial model"" and ""subgiant"") have been used to
investigate the star formation history of Draco.

  2001 M. Livio, ed., Cambridge University Press",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We explore the relationship between the mass function of CDM halos and
dynamical probes of the mass function such as the distribution of gravitational
lens separations and the local velocity function. The compression of galactic
halos by the cooling baryons, a standard component of modern models, leads to a
feature in the distribution of lens separations near 3 arcsec or in the
velocity function near 400 km/s. The two probes of the mass function, lens
separations and the local velocity function, are mutually consistent. Producing
the observed velocity function of galaxies or the separation distribution using
standard adiabatic compression models requires more cold baryons, an equivalent
cosmological density of Omega_b=0.02 compared to a total cosmological
Omega_b=0.04, than are observed in standard accountings of the baryonic content
of galaxies, Omega_b=0.006$, or our Galaxy, Omega_b<0.015. The requirement for
a higher cold baryon density than is usually assigned to galaxies appears to be
generic to models which use the standard adiabatic compression models for the
transformation of the CDM halo by the cooling baryons. If real, this dynamical
baryon discrepancy suggests either that we are neglecting half of the cold
baryonic mass in standard galactic models (e.g. a MACHO, cold molecular or warm
gas component), or that there is a problem with standard adiabatic compression
models.

method to study two dimensional Dirac fermions with quenched disorder in two
dimensions which allows to treat non perturbative freezing phenomena. For
purely random gauge disorder it is known that the exact zero energy eigenstate
exhibits a freezing-like transition at a threshold value of disorder
$\sigma=\sigma_{th}=2$. Here we compute the dynamical exponent $z$ which
characterizes the critical behaviour of the density of states around zero
energy, and find that it also exhibits a phase transition. Specifically, we
find that $\rho(E=0 + i \epsilon) \sim \epsilon^{2/z-1}$ (and $\rho(E) \sim
E^{2/z-1}$) with $z=1 + \sigma$ for $\sigma < 2$ and $z=\sqrt{8 \sigma} - 1$
for $\sigma > 2$. For a finite system size $L<\epsilon^{-1/z}$ we find large
sample to sample fluctuations with a typical $\rho_{\epsilon}(0) \sim L^{z-2}$.
Adding a scalar random potential of small variance $\delta$, as in the
corresponding quantum Hall system, yields a finite noncritical $\rho(0) \sim
\delta^{\alpha}$ whose scaling exponent $\alpha$ exhibits two transitions, one
at $\sigma_{th}/4$ and the other at $\sigma_{th}$. These transitions are shown
to be related to the one of a directed polymer on a Cayley tree with random
signs (or complex) Boltzmann weights. Some observations are made for the strong
disorder regime relevant to describe transport in the quantum Hall system.

pinning energy in the d-wave pairing case is 4 -- 13 times larger than those in
the s-wave pairing cases. This means that an enhancement of pinning effect in
unconventional superconductors occurs due to the breakdown of the Anderson's
theorem. The case of a chiral p-wave superconductor is also investigated in
terms of the vortex core states subject to the Andreev reflection, where
important is whether the vorticity and chirality are parallel or antiparallel.

the hole left behind, as well as local field effects. However, they are
performed under the assumption that the atoms occupy fixed equilibrium
positions and do not include effects of the interaction of the lattice
vibrations with the electronic states (electron-phonon interaction). This
interaction shifts and broadens the energies at which structure in the optical
spectra is observed, the corresponding shifts being of the order of the
accuracy claimed for the ab initio calculations. These shifts and broadenings
can be calculated with various degrees of reliability using a number of
semiempirical and ab initio techniques, but no full calculations of the optical

  This article discusses experimental and theoretical aspects of the

would then decrease the upper bound on m_1/2 due to the lower bound of
Brookhaven data, and hence lower the SUSY mass spectrum, making it more
accessible to accelerators. At the electroweak scale, the phases have to be

two quantities simultaneously. Toward the goal, we first formulate a method for
obtaining a bird-eye view of the phenomenon of neutrino oscillation by
introducing a new powerful tool called the ``CP trajectory diagram in
bi-probability space''. It allows us to represent pictorially the three effects
separately in a single diagram; effect from genuine CP violation due to the sin
delta term, effect from the CP conserving cos delta term, and the fake CP
violating effect due to earth matter. By using the CP trajectory diagram we
observe that there is a two-fold ambiguity in the determination of delta which
is related with the sign of Delta m^2_{13}. We then address the question of
what are the promising options for conceptual design of experiments at low
energies which looks for CP violation and at the same time would resolve the
two-fold ambiguity. We point out that a version with distance of about 700 km,

philosophers of consciousness and others. A framework is proposed and explained
for the `psycho-physical-parallelism' between conscious experiences and the
mathematical structures of quantum physics (e.g., a set of quantum operators
obeying some algebra, and a quantum state giving the expectation value of each
operator). In particular, it is proposed that each set of possible conscious
experiences has a measure given by the expectation value of a corresponding
operator (a positive-operator-valued measure). Then one has a generalization of
the Weak Anthropic Principle named the Conditional Aesthemic Principle: given
that we are conscious beings, our conscious experiences are likely to be
typical experiences in the set of all conscious experiences with its measure.

of SLOCC operations of the kind $\rho'=(A\otimes B)\rho(A\otimes B)^\dagger$.
These normal forms can be obtained by considering a Lorentz singular value
decomposition on a real parameterization of the density matrix. We show that
the Lorentz singular values are variationally defined and give rise to
entanglement monotones, with as a special case the concurrence. Next a
necessary and sufficient criterion is conjectured for a mixed state to be
convertible into another specific one with a non-zero probability. Finally the
formalism of the Lorentz singular value decomposition is applied to tripartite
pure states of qubits. New proofs are given for the existence of the GHZ- and
W-class of states, and a rigorous proof for the optimal distillation of a
GHZ-state is derived.
