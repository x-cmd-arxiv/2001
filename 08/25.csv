radio-quiet quasars (RQQs), radio-loud quasars (RLQs) and radio galaxies (RGs).
We describe new WFPC2 R-band observations for 14 objects and model these images
in conjunction with the data already reported in McLure et al (1999). We find
that spheroidal hosts become more prevalent with increasing nuclear luminosity
such that, for nuclear luminosities M_V < -23.5, the hosts of both radio-loud
and radio-quiet AGN are virtually all massive ellipticals. Moreover we
demonstrate that the basic properties of these hosts are indistinguishable from
those of quiescent, evolved, low-redshift ellipticals of comparable mass. This
result kills any lingering notion that radio-loudness is determined by
host-galaxy morphology, and also sets severe constraints on evolutionary
schemes which attempt to link low-z ULIRGs with RQQs. Instead, we show that our
results are as expected given the relationship between black-hole and spheroid
mass established for nearby galaxies, and apply this relation to estimate the
mass of the black hole in each object. The results agree very well with
completely-independent estimates based on nuclear emission-line widths; all the
quasars in our sample have M(bh) > 5 x 10^8 solar masses, while the radio-loud
objects are confined to M(bh) > 10^9 solar masses. This apparent mass-threshold
difference, which provides a natural explanation for why RQQs outnumber RLQs by
a factor of 10, appears to reflect the existence of a minimum and maximum level
of black-hole radio output which is a strong function of black-hole mass.
Finally, we use our results to estimate the fraction of massive
spheroids/black-holes which produce quasar-level activity. This fraction is
\~0.1% at the present day, rising to > 10% at z = 2-3.

from cluster galaxies. Three different magnification-based reconstruction
methods are employed using both local and non-local techniques. We have
modified the standard single power-law slope number count theory to incorporate
a break and applied this to our observations. Fitting analytical magnification
profiles of different cluster models to the observed number counts, we find
that the cluster is best described either by a NFW model with scale radius
r_s=334+/-191 kpc/h and normalisation kappa_s=0.23+/-0.08 or a power-law
profile with slope xi=0.61+/-0.11, central surface mass density
kappa_0=1.52+/-0.20 and assuming a core radius of r_core=35 kpc/h. The NFW
model predicts that the cumulative projected mass contained within a radius R
scales as M(<R)=2.9*10^14*(R/1')^[1.3-0.5lg (R/1')] M_sol/h. Finally, we have
exploited the fact that flux magnification effectively enables us to probe
deeper than the physical limiting magnitude of our observations in searching
for a change of slope in the U band number counts. We rule out both a total
flattening of the counts with a break up to U_AB<=26.6 and a change of slope,
reported by some studies, from dlog N/dm=0.4->0.15 up to U_AB<=26.4 with 95%

agreement with other recent findings, we confirm that the direct overlap is
small. Of the 17 sub-mm sources detected in this field at 850 microns, only one
is coincident with a Chandra source. The resulting limits imply that the
majority of SCUBA sources are not powered by AGN, unless the central engine is
obscured by Compton-thick material with a low (<1 per cent) scattered
component. Furthermore, since Chandra detects only ~5 per cent of SCUBA
sources, the typical obscuration would need to be almost isotropic. The X-ray
upper limits are so strong that in most cases we can also rule out a starburst
SED at low redshift, suggesting that the majority of SCUBA sources lie at z>1
even if they are purely starburst galaxies. Despite the low detection rate, we
find evidence for strong angular clustering between the X-ray and sub-mm
populations. The implication is that AGN and SCUBA sources trace the same
large-scale structure but do not generally coincide. If bright sub-mm sources
represent massive elliptical galaxies in formation, we suggest that (for a
given galaxy) the major episode of star-formation must be distinct from the
period of observable quasar activity.

injection energy comparable to that of the impulsive energy in the initial
fireball is required to make a detectable signature in the afterglow
lightcurves. For the case of a Poynting-flux-dominated injection, this leads to
a gradual achromatic bump feature. For the case when the injection is
kinetic-energy-dominated, the collision between the rear (injected) and the
forward shell mild if the relative velocity between the colliding shells does
not exceed a critical value defined by their energy ratio. Otherwise, the
injection is violent, and an additional pair of shocks will form at the
discontinuity between two colliding shells, so that there are altogether three
shock-heated regions from which the emission contributes to the final
lightcurves. We describe the shell-merging process in detail and present
broadband lightcurves with the injection signatures. A violent collision
results in very complicated features, which differs from the gradual bump
signature found in the Poynting-flux or mild matter injection cases. In all the
cases, the energetics of the fireball as well as the absolute afterglow flux
level after the injection are boosted after the injection. Identifying the
different injection signatures from future early afterglow observations may
provide diagnostics about the nature of the fireball and of the central engine.

indicated by a shift of F_p(H) with decreasing temperature. The lack of scaling
of F_p(H) suggests the presence of 10 to 20% of nonsuperconducting regions
inside the grains, which are smaller than the diameter of fluxon cores 2xi at
high temperature and become effective with decreasing temperature when xi(T)
approaches the nanostructural scale. Transmission electron microscopy revealed
cubic and graphite nanoprecipitates with 2 to 5 nm size, consistent with the
above hypothesis since xi(0) = 6 nm. High critical current densities, more than
10^6 A/cm^2 at 1 T and 4.2 K, were obtained for grain colonies separated by

scattering by the precipitates, indicating the possibility that strong core

with elongation along the flow. At the interface, this contraction of chains is

  Model Checking","29 pages",,,,"cs.DC cs.AR",,"  The memory model of a shared-memory multiprocessor is a contract between the
designer and programmer of the multiprocessor. The sequential consistency
memory model specifies a total order among the memory (read and write) events
performed at each processor. A trace of a memory system satisfies sequential
consistency if there exists a total order of all memory events in the trace
that is both consistent with the total order at each processor and has the
property that every read event to a location returns the value of the last
write to that location.
  Descriptions of shared-memory systems are typically parameterized by the
number of processors, the number of memory locations, and the number of data
values. It has been shown that even for finite parameter values, verifying
sequential consistency on general shared-memory systems is undecidable. We
observe that, in practice, shared-memory systems satisfy the properties of
causality and data independence. Causality is the property that values of read
events flow from values of write events. Data independence is the property that
all traces can be generated by renaming data values from traces where the
written values are distinct from each other. If a causal and data independent
system also has the property that the logical order of write events to each
location is identical to their temporal order, then sequential consistency can
be verified algorithmically. Specifically, we present a model checking
algorithm to verify sequential consistency on such systems for a finite number
of processors and memory locations and an arbitrary number of data values.

  discovery potential","Master's thesis",,,,"hep-ph",,"  In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), the simultaneous
appearance of lepton and baryon number violation causes the proton to decay
much faster than the experimental bound allows. Customarily, a discrete
symmetry known as R-parity is imposed to forbid these dangerous interactions.
This work begins by arguing that there is no deep theoretical motivation for
preferring R-parity over other discrete symmetries and continues by adopting
the MSSM with baryon number conservation replacing R-parity conservation. For
the purpose of studying the influence of the consequent lepton number violating
interactions, 1278 new decay channels of supersymmetric particles into Standard
Model particles have been included in the PYTHIA event generator. The augmented
event generator is then used in combination with the atlfast detector
simulation to study the impact of lepton number violation on event topologies
in the ATLAS detector, and trigger menus designed for LV-SUSY are proposed
based on very general conclusions. The subsequent analysis uses a combination
of primitive cuts and neural networks to optimize the discriminating power
between signal and background events. In all scenarios studied, it is found
that a $5\sigma$ discovery is possible for cross sections down to $10^{-10}$ mb
with an integrated luminosity of 30 fb$^{-1}$.

infrared cutoff $\ssig\ll 1$ and an ultraviolet cutoff $\Lambda\sim 1$ in the
interaction term, in units of the mass of the charged particle. Due to
translation invariance, it suffices to study $\Hps$, the restriction of the
hamiltonian to the fibre Hilbert space of the conserved momentum operator
associated to total momentum $p\in\R^3$. Under the condition that the coupling
constant $g$ and the conserved momentum $p$ are sufficiently small, the
following statements hold: (1) For every $\ssig>0$, $E_0:=inf spec \Hps$ is an
eigenvalue with corresponding eigenvector $\Omega[p,\ssig]\in\Hp$. (2) For all
$\ssig\geq0$, the first and second derivatives of $(\Egrd-\frac{|p|^2}{2})$ are
$O(g^\delta)$ for some $\delta>0$. (3) $\Omega[p,\ssig]$ is not an element of
the Fock space $\Hp$ in the limit $\ssig\to0$, if $|p|>0$. Our proofs are based
on the operator-theoretic renormalization group of V. Bach, J. Fr\""ohlich, and

the strictly marginal nature of the leading interaction term, and a main issue

compare cards and the holder of the smallest card wins. Using the rate
equations approach, we treat the stochastic version of the game in which cards
are drawn randomly. We obtain an exact solution for arbitrary initial
conditions. In general, the game approaches a steady state where the card
densities of the two players are proportional to each other. The leading small
size behavior of the initial card densities determines the corresponding
proportionality constant, while the next correction governs the asymptotic time
dependence. The relaxation towards the steady state exhibits a rich behavior,
e.g., it may be algebraically slow or exponentially fast. Moreover, in ruin
situations where one player eventually wins all cards, the game may even end in
a finite time.

effective Lagrangians. The model includes one- and two-pion exchange
contributions up to chiral order three. We show that a quantitative fit of the
$NN$ $D$-wave phase shifts requires contact terms (which represent the short
range force) of order four. Within this framework, the $NN$ phase shifts below
300 MeV lab. energy and the properties of the deuteron are reproduced with
high-precision. This chiral $NN$ potential represents a reliable starting point
for testing the chiral effective field theory approach in exact few-nucleon and
microscopic nuclear many-body calculations. An important implication of the
present work is that the chiral $2\pi$ exchange at order four is of crucial
interest for future chiral $NN$ potential development.

surface energy, neutron skin thickness and binding energy per nucleon are also
displayed as a function of temperature and their behaviours are discussed. It
is shown that the caloric curve is sensitive to the proton fraction and to the
Coulomb interaction. At T=0 the droplet properties do not depend on the
parameterization used. At finite temperature however, the sensitivity appears.

accelerating gradient of ~25 MeV/m, i.e., the ""new working point."" The uv
pulses required for cathode excitation will be generated by tripling the output
of a Ti:sapphire laser system consisting of a highly stable cw mode-locked
