diffusion have been calculated for initial iron abundances of [Fe/H] = -2.3,
-2.1, -1.9 and -1.7. These models were calculated for a large variety of masses
and three separate mixing lengths, \alpha = 1.50, 1.75 and 2.00 (with \alpha =
1.75 being the solar calibrated mixing length). The change in the surface iron
abundance for stars of different masses was determined for the ages 11, 13 and
15 Gyr. Iron settles out of the surface convection zone on the main sequence;
this iron is dredged back up when the convection zone deepens on the giant
branch. In all cases, the surface [Fe/H] abundance in the turn-off stars was at
least 0.28 dex lower than the surface [Fe/H] abundance in giant-branch stars of
the same age. However, recent high dispersion spectra of stars in the globular
cluster NGC 6397 found that the turn-off and giant branch stars had identical
(within a few percent) iron abundances of [Fe/H] =-2.03 (Gratton et al. 2001).
These observations prove that heavy element diffusion must be inhibited in the
surface layers of metal-poor stars. When diffusion is inhibited in the outer
layers of a stellar model, the predicted temperatures of the models are similar
to models evolved without diffusion, while the predicted lifetimes are similar
to stars in which diffusion is not inhibited. Isochrones constructed from the
models in which diffusion is inhibited fall half-way between isochrones without
diffusion, and isochrones with full diffusion. As a result, absolute globular
cluster ages which are based upon the absolute magnitude of the turn-off are 4%
larger than ages inferred from full diffusion isochrones, and 4% smaller than
ages inferred from no diffusion isochrones.

between the creation of stars and dust in a massive proto galaxy and the growth
of its central black hole. This model predicts that sub-mm luminosity peaks
after only ~ 0.2 Gyr. However, without a very massive seed black hole,
Eddington-limited growth means that a black hole mass of 10^9 solar masses, and
hence very luminous AGN activity, cannot be produced until > 0.5 Gyr after the
formation of the first massive stars in the halo. The model thus predicts a
time-lag between the peak of sub-mm luminosity and AGN luminosity in a massive
proto-elliptical of a few times 10^8 years. For a formation redshift z = 5,
this means that powerful AGN activity is delayed until z = 3.5, by which time
star formation in the host is 90% complete, and sub-mm luminosity has declined
to ~ 25% of its peak value. This provides a natural explanation for why
successful sub-mm detections of luminous radio galaxies are largely confined to
z > 2.5. Conversely the model also predicts that while all high-redshift
luminous sub-mm-selected sources should contain an active (and growing) black
hole, the typical luminosity of the AGN in such objects is ~1000 times smaller
than that of the most powerful AGN. This is consistent with the almost complete
failure to detect sub-mm selected galaxies with existing X-ray surveys. Finally
the model yields a black-hole:spheroid mass ratio which evolves rapidly in the
first Gyr, but asymptotes to ~ 0.001-0.003 in agreement with results at low
redshift. This ratio arises not because the AGN terminates star formation, but
because fueling of the massive black hole is linked to the total mass of gas
available for star formation in the host.

produced by a binary star placed at the center of an empty spherical cavity
inside a circumbinary ellipsoidal and optically thin envelope made of dust
grains. Mie single-scattering is considered along with pre- and post-scattering
extinction factors which produce a time-varying optical depth and affect the
morphology of the periodic variations. We are interested in the effects that
various parameters will have on the average polarization, the amplitude of the
polarimetric variations, and the morphology of the variability. We show that
the absolute amplitudes of the variations are smaller for Mie scattering than
for Thomson scattering. Among the four grain types that we have studied, the
highest polarizations are produced by grains with sizes in the range 0.1-0.2
micron. In general, the variations are seen twice per orbit. In some cases,
because spherical dust grains have an asymmetric scattering function, the
polarimetric curves produced also show variations seen once per orbit.
Circumstellar disks produce polarimetric variations of greater amplitude than
circumbinary envelopes.
  Another goal of these simulations is to see if the 1978 BME (Brown, McLean, &
Emslie, ApJ, 68, 415) formalism, which uses a Fourier analysis of the
polarimetric variations to find the orbital inclination for Thomson-scattering
envelopes, can still be used for Mie scattering. We find that this is the case,
if the amplitude of the variations is sufficient and the true inclinations is
i_true > 45 deg. For eccentric orbits, the first-order coefficients of the
Fourier fit, instead of second-order ones, can be used to find almost all
inclinations.

following an approximately 13 yr outburst which ended in Feb 2001. Unlike all
other known transient neutron stars, the duration of this recent outburst is as
long as the thermal diffusion time of the crust. The large amount of heat
deposited by reactions in the crust will have heated the crust to temperatures
much higher than the equilibrium core temperature. As a result, the thermal
luminosity currently observed from the neutron star is dominated not by the
core, but by the crust. Moreover, the level and the time evolution of quiescent
luminosity is determined mostly by the amount of heat deposited in the crust
during the most recent outburst. Using estimates of the outburst mass accretion
rate, our calculations of the quiescent flux immediately following the end of
the outburst agree with the observed quiescent flux to within a factor of a
few. We present simulations of the evolution of the quiescent lightcurve for
different scenarios of the crust microphysics, and demonstrate that monitoring

extension shows a shell-like morphology, suggesting that they are a pair of
superbubbles induced by the superwind activity rather than by the interaction
between the radio jet and the ambient gas clouds. If this is the case, the
intense starburst responsible for the formation of superbubbles could occur
$\sim 1 \times 10^9$ yr ago. On the other hand, the age of the radio jets may
be of the order of $\sim 10^6$ yr, being much shorter than the starburst age.
Therefore, the two events, i.e., the starburst and the radio-jet activities,
are independent phenomena. However, their directions of the expanding motions
could be governed by the rotational motion of the gaseous component in the host
galaxy. This idea appears to explain the alignment effect of MRC 0406$-$244.

angular momentum transfer rate including self-gravity and calculated the
transfer rate with the results of our $N$-body simulations. Spiral structure is
formed within Roche limit by self-gravity and energy dissipation of inelastic
collisions, and angular momentum is effectively transfered outward. Angular
momentum transfer is dominated by both gravitational torque due to the spiral
structure and particles' collective motion associated with the structure. Since
formation and evolution of the spiral structure is regulated by the disk
surface density, the angular momentum transfer rate depends on surface density,
but not on particle size or number, so that the time scale of evolution of a
particulate disk is independent on the number of particles ($N$) that is used
to represent the disk, if $N$ is large enough to represent the spiral
structure. With $N=10^5$, the detailed spiral structure is resolved while it is
only poorly resolved with $N=10^3$, however, we found that calculated angular
momentum transfer does not change as long as $N \gtrsim 10^3$.

the structure of the simulations. Stronger driving produces greater density
fluctuations, and longer wavelength driving produces larger structures.
Magnetic fields have a less pronounced effect on structure, and one that is not
monotonic with field strength. Aligned structures are seen only with
low-density tracers, and when the intensity of the field is large. Comparing
different regions with the same tracers (or the same region with different
tracers) can give information about physical conditions: different density
tracers can help determine the size of the density fluctuations and thus the
strength of the driving. Nevertheless, velocity superposition of multiple
physical clumps can fully obscure the physical properties of those clumps, and
short wavelength driving worsens this effect. Regarding Larson's relationships,
we confirm previous claims that the mean density-size relationship is an
artifact of the observations; and the velocity dispersion-size relationship, is
consistent with observations. Regarding the mass spectra, we show that, when we
look for clumps with high enough resolution, they converge to a log-normal

in the theory of derivative pricing. Specific applications of this principle
have been used quite often under the name of `change of numeraire', but in
recent work it was shown that when invoked as a fundamental first principle, it
provides a powerful alternative method for the derivation of prices and hedges
of derivative securities, when prices of the underlying tradables are driven by
Wiener processes. In this article we extend this work to the pricing problem in
markets driven not only by Wiener processes but also by Poisson processes, i.e.
jump-diffusion models. It is shown that in this case too, the focus on symmetry
aspects of the problem leads to important simplifications of, and a deeper
insight into the problem. Among the applications of the theory we consider the
pricing of stock options in the presence of jumps, and Levy-processes. Next we
show how the same theory, by restricting the number of jumps, can be used to
model credit risk, leading to a `market model' of credit risk. Both the
traditional Duffie-Singleton and Jarrow-Turnbull models can be described within
this framework, but also more general models, which incorporate default
correlation in a consistent way. As an application of this theory we look at
the pricing of a credit default swap (CDS) and a first-to-default basket

restores non-local correlations to the dynamical mean field approximation
(DMFA) while preserving the lattice symmetries. The DCA becomes exact for an
infinite cluster size, while reducing to the DMFA for a cluster size of unity.
We present a generalization of the Hirsch-Fye QMC algorithm for the solution of
the embedded cluster problem. We use the two-dimensional Hubbard model to
illustrate the performance of the DCA technique. At half-filling, we show that
the DCA drives the spurious finite-temperature antiferromagnetic transition
found in the DMFA slowly towards zero temperature as the cluster size
increases, in conformity with the Mermin-Wagner theorem. Moreover, we find that
there is a finite temperature metal to insulator transition which persists into
the weak-coupling regime. This suggests that the magnetism of the model is
Heisenberg like for all non-zero interactions. Away from half-filling, we find
that the sign problem that arises in QMC simulations is significantly less
severe in the context of DCA. Hence, we were able to obtain good statistics for
small clusters. For these clusters, the DCA results show evidence of non-Fermi
liquid behavior and superconductivity near half-filling.

of this thesis (in the form it was submitted to the University of London,

encompasses all individual Dirac-ADM actions corresponding to different choices
$\sf T$ of foliating $\cal Y$. The history Poisson brackets of spacetime fields

diffeomorphisms Diff$\cal Y$ and temporal diffeomorphisms Diff$\cal T$. Both of

loop, but also at two loops: slowly with sharp cutoff (as a momentum-scale
expansion), and rapidly in the case of a smooth exponential cutoff. We also
show that the two loop contributions to certain higher derivative operators

  Freyberger, Holger Mack, and Michael Mussinger","Estimation of quantum channels with finite resources","15 pages, submitted to J. Phys. A",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We investigate the problem of determining the parameters that describe a
quantum channel. It is assumed that the users of the channel have at best only
partial knowledge of it and make use of a finite amount of resources to
estimate it. We discuss simple protocols for the estimation of the parameters
of several classes of channels that are studied in the current literature. We
define two different quantitative measures of the quality of the estimation
schemes, one based on the standard deviation, the other one on the fidelity.
The possibility of protocols that employ entangled particles is also
considered. It turns out that the use of entangled particles as a new kind of
nonclassical resource enhances the estimation quality of some classes of
quantum channel. Further, the investigated methods allow us to extend them to
higher dimensional quantum systems.
