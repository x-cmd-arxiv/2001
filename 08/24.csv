effective temperature (34,500 K) and surface gravity (log g=8.3) of the WD. The
radius of the dK component is 18% larger than that of a normal Hyades dwarf of
the same mass. This expansion is attributed to the extensive coverage of the
surface by starspots, causing the star to expand in response. The WD radius,
determined from a radiometric analysis and from eclipse ingress timings, is
0.0107 Rsun. The position of the star in the M-R plane is in full accord with
theory for a degenerate CO WD. The high temperature and mass of the WD present
an evolutionary paradox: the WD is the most massive known in the Hyades, but
also the hottest and youngest. We suggest that the explanation is that the WD
is indeed very young, and is descended from a triple consisting of a blue
straggler and a more-distant dK companion. We estimate that the common-envelope

monitored for 35 days and 12 days with ASCA and RXTE (and EUVE for Ton S180).
The short time scale (hours-days) variability patterns were very similar across
energy bands, with no evidence of lags between any of the energy bands studied.
The fractional variability amplitude was almost independent of energy band. It
is difficult to simultaneously explain soft Seyferts stronger variability,
softer spectra, and weaker energy-dependence of the variability relative to
hard Seyferts. The soft and hard band light curves diverged on the longest time
scales probed, consistent with the fluctuation power density spectra that
showed relatively greater power on long time scales in the softest bands. The
simplest explanation is that a relatively hard, rapidly-variable component
dominates the total X-ray spectrum and a slowly-variable soft excess is present
in the lowest energy channels of ASCA. Although it would be natural to identify
the latter with an accretion disk and the former with a corona surrounding it,
a standard thin disk could not get hot enough to radiate significantly in the
ASCA band, and the observed variability time scales are much too short. The
hard component may have a more complex shape than a pure power-law. The most
rapid factor of 2 flares and dips occurred within ~1000 sec in Ark 564 and a
bit more slowly in Ton S180. The speed of the luminosity changes rules out
viscous or thermal processes and limits the size of the individual emission
regions to <~15 Schwarzschild radii (and probably much less), that is, to
either the inner disk or small regions in a corona.

with high precision at various locations in \v{C}erenkov pool using a
distributed array of telescopes. It was shown earlier that this photon front
can be fitted with a spherical surface traveling at a speed of light and
originating from a single point on the shower axis. Radius of curvature of the
spherical shower front ($R$) is approximately equal to the height of shower
maximum from observation level. For a given primary species, it is also found
that $R$ varies with the primary energy ($E$) and this provides a method of
estimating the primary energy. In general, one can estimate the arrival times
at each telescope using the radius of curvature, arrival direction of the
primary and the core location. This, when compared with the data enables us to
estimate the above parameters for each shower. This method of obtaining the
arrival direction alleviates the difficulty in the form of systematics arising
out of the plane wavefront approximation for the \v{C}erenkov front. Another
outstanding problem in the field of atmospheric \v{C}erenkov technique is the
difficulty in locating the shower core. This method seems to solve both these

the energy of the primary if the nature of the primary is known. Combining
these two independent estimates of the primary energy, the energy resolution

within perturbative QCD up to a few nonperturbative constants. Though
suppressed at large transverse momentum by a factor Lambda_QCD m_b/p_t^2
relative to b quark fragmentation production, it can be important at large
rapidities. A signature for this heavy-quark recombination mechanism in
proton-antiproton colliders is the presence of rapidity asymmetries in B cross
sections. Given reasonable assumptions about the size of nonperturbative
parameters entering the calculation, we find that the asymmetries are only
significant for rapidities larger than those currently probed by collider

broadening of the vector meson width and dropping vector meson masses lead to a
small enhancement of the dilepton yield below the $\omega$ meson mass pole in
$p Cu$ collisions compared to $p C$, which is, however, not sufficient to
explain the enhanced production of dileptons as observed in the experiment by
the KEK-PS E325 collaboration. It is argued that such in-medium effects are
expected to be small due to kinematical reasons -- the dominant part of vector
mesons radiate dileptons and decay outside the nucleus due to the finite
formation time for $\rho$ and $\omega$ mesons, which is large by Lorentz
covariance since the produced vector mesons move with high velocity relative to
the target nucleus.
