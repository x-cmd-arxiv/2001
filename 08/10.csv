halos and their mass assembly histories, using a statistical sample of halos in
a high-resolution N-body simulation of the LCDM cosmology. For each halo at
z=0, we identify its merger-history tree, and determine concentration
parameters c_vir for all progenitors, thus providing a structural merger tree
for each halo. We fit the mass accretion histories by a universal function with
one parameter, the formation epoch a_c, defined when the log mass accretion
rate dlogM/dloga falls below a critical value S. We find that late forming
galaxies tend to be less concentrated, such that c_vir ``observed'' at any
epoch a_o is strongly correlated with a_c via c_vir=c_1*a_o/a_c. Scatter about
this relation is mostly due to measurement errors in c_v and a_c, implying that
the actual spread in c_vir for halos of a given mass can be mostly attributed
to scatter in a_c. We demonstrate that this relation can also be used to
predict the mass and redshift dependence of c_v, and the scatter about the
median c_vir(M,z), using accretion histories derived from the Extended
Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism, after adjusting for a constant offset between
the formation times as predicted by EPS and as measured in the simulations;this
new ingredient can thus be easily incorporated into semi-analytic models of
galaxy formation. The correlation found between halo concentration and mass
accretion rate suggests a physical interpretation: for high mass infall rates
the central density is related to the background density; when the mass infall
rate slows, the central density stays approximately constant and the halo
concentration just grows as R_vir. The tight correlation demonstrated here
provides an essential new ingredient for galaxy formation modeling.

we show that such a geometry will induce a phase change in the eigenstates of a
massive neutrino and we calculate the phase change. We also calculate the delay
in the neutrino flight times in this geometry. Applying our results to the
presently observed background vacuum energy density, we find that for neutrino
sources further than $1.5 Gpc$ away both effects become non-trivial, being of
the order of the standard relativistic corrections. Such sources are within the
obsevable Hubble Deep Field. The results which are theoretically interesting
are also potentially useful, in the future, as detection techniques improve.
For example such effects on neutrinos from distant sources like supernovae
could be used, in an independent method alternative to standard candles, to
constrain the dark energy density and the deceleration parameter. The
discussion is extended to investigate Caianiello's inertial or maximal
acceleration (MA) effects of such a vacuum dominated spacetime on neutrino
oscillations. Assuming that the MA phenomenon exists, we find that its form as
generated by the presently observed vacuum energy density would still have
little or no measurable effect on neutrino phase evolution.

consistent with their being the progenitors of early-type galaxies. The optical
and IR colors, number-magnitude relation and angular clustering together
indicate modest evolution and increased star formation rates among the

galaxies with $H$ magnitudes between 17 and 20 rise with a slope that is much
steeper than that of the total H sample. The surface density of red galaxies
drops from roughly 3000 per square degree at H = 20.5, I-H > 3 to ~ 20 per

magnitudes bluer on average than a pure old population and span a range of more
than three magnitudes. The colors, and photometric redshifts derived from them,
indicate that the red galaxies have redshift distributions adequately described
by Gaussians with sigma_z ~ 0.2$ centered near redshift one, with the exception
that galaxies having $V-I<1.6$ and $I-H>3$ are primarily in the 1.5 < z < 2

to, or larger than, those found for early-type galaxies at lower redshifts. A
simple photometric evolution model reproduces the counts of the red galaxies,
with only a ~ 30% decline in the underlying space density of early-type

that the near-infrared H2 images can trace previously undetected molecular

brightest in the bright radio bar, at the interface between the supernova
remnant and the giant molecular cloud, and following filaments in the radio
shell. The near-infrared [Fe II] and the mid-infrared 12-18 micron filter

mid-infrared spectrum is dominated by bright ionic lines and H2 S(2) through
S(7). There are no aromatic hydrocarbons associated with the shocks, nor is
their any mid-infrared continuum, suggesting that macromolecules and very small

related to the discrepancies between the model (as determined by the scientific
purpose) and the actual distribution of Fourier samples. The flexibility and
rapidity of the method are well adapted to the full array design. A software
named APO that can be used for the design of new generation interferometers

than 20% of the total flux density. We detect low polarization in the GPS
sources -- i.e., typically less than a few percent and often less than one
percent. This establishes that low polarization in the parsec scale structure
is an important defining characteristic of the GPS sources. The dichotomy in
the radio morphology versus optical identification, i.e., galaxies are
symmetric and quasars are not, is basically confirmed from these new data,
which also indicate that the radio emission from GPS quasars is dominated by a
jet, with often a weak or hidden core, suggesting they are at moderate angles
to the line of sight, and so are only moderately beamed.

produces correctly one and two-particle imaginary time correlation functions in
the limit of small densities even for finite Trotter numbers P. We discuss the
conceptual differences between both methods and compare the convergence rate of
both approaches. While the HOA method converges faster than the EPr approach,
EPr gives surprisingly good estimates of thermal quantities already for P = 1.

improvements over simple trigram models have been found, including caching,
higher-order n-grams, skipping, interpolated Kneser-Ney smoothing, and
clustering. We present explorations of variations on, or of the limits of, each
of these techniques, including showing that sentence mixture models may have
more potential. While all of these techniques have been studied separately,
they have rarely been studied in combination. We find some significant
interactions, especially with smoothing and clustering techniques. We compare a
combination of all techniques together to a Katz smoothed trigram model with no
count cutoffs. We achieve perplexity reductions between 38% and 50% (1 bit of
entropy), depending on training data size, as well as a word error rate
reduction of 8.9%. Our perplexity reductions are perhaps the highest reported
compared to a fair baseline. This is the extended version of the paper; it

avenues of language modeling research. Unfortunately, long training times make
maximum entropy research difficult. We present a novel speedup technique: we
change the form of the model to use classes. Our speedup works by creating two
maximum entropy models, the first of which predicts the class of each word, and
the second of which predicts the word itself. This factoring of the model leads
to fewer non-zero indicator functions, and faster normalization, achieving
speedups of up to a factor of 35 over one of the best previous techniques. It
also results in typically slightly lower perplexities. The same trick can be
used to speed training of other machine learning techniques, e.g. neural
networks, applied to any problem with a large number of outputs, such as
language modeling.

  Groundwork for Extension to Gravity","12 pages, no figures",,,,"gr-qc",,"  It has been shown [1,2] that the electromagnetic quantum vacuum makes a
contribution to the inertial mass, $m_i$, in the sense that at least part of
the inertial force of opposition to acceleration, or inertia reaction force,
springs from the electromagnetic quantum vacuum. As experienced in a Rindler
constant acceleration frame the electromagnetic quantum vacuum mainfests an
energy-momentum flux which we call the Rindler flux (RF). The RF, and its
relative, Unruh-Davies radiation, both stem from event-horizon effects in
accelerating reference frames. The force of radiation pressure produced by the
RF proves to be proportional to the acceleration of the reference frame, which
leads to the hypothesis that at least part of the inertia of an object should
be due to the interaction of its quarks and electrons with the RF. We
demonstrate that this quantum vacuum inertia hypothesis is consistent with
general relativity (GR) and that it answers a fundamental question left open
within GR, viz. is there a physical mechanism that generates the reaction force
known as weight when a specific non-geodesic motion is imposed on an object?
The quantum vacuum inertia hypothesis provides such a mechanism, since by
assuming the Einstein principle of local Lorentz-invariance (LLI), we can
immediately show that the same RF arises due to curved spacetime geometry as
for acceleration in flat spactime. Thus the previously derived expression for
the inertial mass contribution from the electromagnetic quantum vacuum field is
exactly equal to the corresponding contribution to the gravitational mass,
$m_g$. Therefore, within the electromagnetic quantum vacuum viewpoint proposed
in [1,2], the Newtonian weak equivalence principle, $m_i=m_g$, ensues in a
straightforward manner.

those states whose truncated n-point functions of the free field are smooth for

is recovered by taking the limit of massless fermions followed by the W boson

this leads to a direct computation of certain topological string amplitudes in
a closed form. This yields new formulae for intersection numbers of cohomology
classes on moduli of Riemann surfaces with punctures (including all the
amplitudes of pure topological gravity in two dimensions). The reinterpretation
of these computations in terms of BPS degeneracies of domain walls leads to
novel integrality predictions for these amplitudes. Moreover we find evidence

Local Realism at phi-factories and p anti-p machines.

Wigner function is determined if $N$ is an odd number, but it does not exist if

standard phase estimation can be applied to measure the energy. Our essential
assumption is that the considered system can be brought into interaction with a
quantum computer. For large n the algorithm could still be applicable for
estimating the density of energy states and might therefore be useful for
finding energy gaps in solid states.

  We show that a simple trick allows to measure eigenvalues of U\otimes

therefore to estimate the autocorrelation function of the density of
eigenstates of U. This can be applied to find periodicities in the energy
spectrum of a quantum system with unknown Hamiltonian if it can be coupled to a
