near-infrared photometry, is designed to robustly identify a statistically
significant and representative sample of evolved galaxies at redshifts z>1. We
have completed an H-band imaging survey over 1.1 square degrees of sky in six
separate fields. The average 5 sigma detection limit in a four arcsecond
diameter aperture is H ~ 20. Here we describe the design of the survey, the
observation strategies, data reduction techniques, and object identification
procedures. We present sample near-infrared and optical photometric catalogs
for objects identified in two survey fields. We perform object detection in all
bandpasses and identify ~ 54,000 galaxies over 1,408 square arcminutes of sky
in the two fields. Of these galaxies, ~ 14,000 are detected in the H-band and ~
2,000 have the colors of evolved galaxies, I - H >3, at z > 1. We find that (1)
the differential number counts N(m) for the H-band detected objects has a slope
of 0.44 at H < 19 and 0.27 for H > 19. In addition, we find that (2) the
differential number counts for the H detected red objects has a slope of 0.85
at H < 20 and 0.32 at H > 20, with a mean surface density ~ 3,000 degree^{-2}
mag^{-1} at H=20. Finally, we find that (3) galaxies with red optical to
near-IR colors (I-H > 3) constitute ~ 20% of the H detected galaxies at H ~ 21,
but only 2% at H = 19. We show that red galaxies are strongly clustered, which
results in a strong field to field variation in their surface density.
Comparisons of observations and predictions based on various formation
scenarios indicate that these red galaxies are consistent with mildly evolving
early-type galaxies at z ~ 1, although with a significant amount of on-going
star formation as indicated by the large scatter in their V-I colors.

a source of experimental information on quantum gravitational effects. While
absent in the framework of general relativity, second harmonic generation
appears in the toy models of sonic and electromagnetic black holes, where
spatial dispersion at high frequencies for waves boosted towards the horizon is
introduced. Localization effects in the light scattering from random
fluctuations of matter fields and space-time metric near the black hole horizon
produce a pronounced peak in the angular distribution of second harmonics of
light in the direction normal to the horizon. Such second harmonic light has
the best chances to escape the vicinity of the black hole. This phenomenon is
similar to the well-known strong enhancement of diffuse second harmonic
emission from a randomly rough metal surface in the direction normal to the
surface.

characterized by a scale-invariant tensorial spectral index and a weakly
scale-dependent scalar spectral index might account for a generic large-scale
structure formation in the multiverses scenario of eternal inflation. Here it
is shown that this statement remains true if the tensorial index is allowed to
slowly vary in a wide range of angular scales. In the cases analyzed in this
paper, the scalar index also slightly depends on the scales. Therefore, the
production of closely resembling each other universes seems to be a common
feature of inflationary scenarios with weakly scale-dependent spectral indices.
With power-law inflation as the extreme case, this is the class of scenarios
which may give the best fit to near future CMB observations.

more subtle sort, giving rise to erroneous conclusions. In particular we show
that [1] the age-metallicity diagram is well populated at all ages and
especially that old, metal-rich stars do exist, [2] the scatter in metallicity
at any given age is larger than the observational errors, [3] the exclusion of
cooler dwarf stars from an age-metallicity sample preferentially excludes old,
metal-rich stars, depleting the upper right-hand corner of the age-metallicity

we do not find significant evidence for large-scale dipole errors in the

elemental abundance ratios, the galaxies in our sample are generally too blue
at a given Mg_2; we ascribe this to the well-known enhancement of the
$\alpha$-elements in luminous early-type galaxies. We confirm a tight relation
between stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma$ and the SBF `fluctuation count'
parameter \Nbar, which is a luminosity-weighted measure of the total number of
stars in a galaxy. The correlation between \Nbar and $\sigma$ is even tighter
than that between Mg_2 and $\sigma$. Finally, we derive FP photometric
parameters for 280 galaxies from the SBF survey data set. Comparisons with
external sources allow us to estimate the errors on these parameters and derive
the correction necessary to bring them onto the SMAC system. The data are used

localization) is ultimately a wave phenomenon has led to the suggestion that
photons could be similarly localized by disorder. This conjecture attracted
wide interest because the differences between photons and electrons - in their
interactions, spin statistics, and methods of injection and detection - may
open a new realm of optical and microwave phenomena, and allow a detailed study
of the Anderson localization transition undisturbed by the Coulomb interaction.
To date, claims of three-dimensional photon localization have been based on
observations of the exponential decay of the electromagnetic wave as it
propagates through the disordered medium. But these reports have come under
close scrutiny because of the possibility that the decay observed may be due to
residual absorption, and because absorption itself may suppress localization.
Here we show that the extent of photon localization can be determined by a
different approach - measurement of the relative size of fluctuations of
certain transmission quantities. The variance of relative fluctuations
accurately reflects the extent of localization, even in the presence of
absorption. Using this approach, we demonstrate photon localization in both
weakly and strongly scattering quasi-one-dimensional dielectric samples and in
periodic metallic wire meshes containing metallic scatterers, while ruling it
out in three-dimensional mixtures of aluminum spheres.

the substrate in the presence of an inhomogeneous flux distribution instead of
successively closing and opening of source shutters is studied via Monte Carlo
simulations. It is found that the concentration of each compound is
sinusoidally modulated along the growth direction, caused by the uneven arrival
of Se and Te atoms at a given point of the sample, and by the variation of the
Te/Se ratio at that point due to the rotation of the substrate. In this way we
obtain a ZnSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ alloy in which the composition $x$ varies
sinusoidally along the growth direction. The period of the modulation is
directly controlled by the rate of the substrate rotation. The amplitude of the
compositional modulation is monotonous for small angular velocities of the
substrate rotation, but is itself modulated for large angular velocities. The
average amplitude of the modulation pattern decreases as the angular velocity
of substrate rotation increases and the measurement position approaches the
center of rotation. The simulation results are in good agreement with
previously published experimental measurements on superlattices fabricated in
this manner.

PSC asserts that, given a group action, for any group-invariant Lagrangian the

group-invariant fields are equivalent to the Euler-Lagrange equations of a
canonically defined, symmetry-reduced Lagrangian. We investigate the validity
of PSC for local gravitational theories built from a metric. It is shown that
there are two independent conditions which must be satisfied for PSC to be
valid. One of these conditions, obtained previously in the context of
transverse symmetry group actions, provides a generalization of the well-known
unimodularity condition that arises in spatially homogeneous cosmological
models. The other condition seems to be new. The conditions that determine the
validity of PSC are equivalent to pointwise conditions on the group action
alone. These results are illustrated with a variety of examples from general
relativity. It is straightforward to generalize all of our results to any

fermion action for quarks and an RG-improved gauge action for gluons on a
$16^3\times 32\times 16$ and $24^3\times 32\times 16$ lattice at $\beta=2.6$
corresponding to the lattice spacing $1/a\approx 2$GeV. Quark loop contractions
which appear in Penguin diagrams are calculated by the random noise method, and
the $\Delta I=1/2$ matrix elements which require subtractions with the quark
loop contractions are obtained with a statistical accuracy of about 10%. We
confirm the chiral properties required of the $K\to\pi$ matrix elements.
Matching the lattice matrix elements to those in the continuum at $\mu=1/a$
using the perturbative renormalization factor to one loop order, and running to
the scale $\mu=m_c=1.3$ GeV with the renormalization group for $N_f=3$ flavors,
we calculate all the matrix elements needed for the decay amplitudes. With
these matrix elements, the $\Delta I=3/2$ decay amplitude shows a good
agreement with experiment in the chiral limit. The $\Delta I=1/2$ amplitude, on
the other hand, is about 50--60% of the experimental one even after chiral
extrapolation. In view ofthe insufficient enhancement of the $\Delta I=1/2$
contribution, we employ the experimental values for the real parts of the decay
amplitudes in our calculation of $\epsilon'/\epsilon$. We find that the $\Delta
I=3/2$ contribution is larger than the $\Delta I=1/2$ contribution so that
$\epsilon'/\epsilon$ is negative and has a magnitude of order $10^{-4}$.
Possible reasons for these unsatisfactory results are discussed.

proceeds via an expanding shell of dilaton gradients and curvature which
interpolates between two regions of distinct angular geometry. The string
coupling remains weak throughout. For small tachyon VEVs, evidence comes from
quiver theories on D-branes probes, in which deformations by twisted couplings
smoothly connect non-supersymmetric orbifolds to supersymmetric orbifolds of
reduced order. For large tachyon VEVs, evidence comes from worldsheet RG flow
and spacetime gravity. For $\IC^2/\IZ_n$, we exhibit infinite sequences of
transitions producing SUSY ALE spaces via twisted closed string condensation
from non-supersymmetric ALE spaces. In a $T$-dual description this provides a
mechanism for creating NS5-branes via {\it closed} string tachyon condensation

  version",,,,"math-ph math.MP math.OA",,"  We study various noncommutative geometric aspects of the compact quantum
group SU_q(2) for positive q (not equal to 1), following the suggestion of
Connes and his coauthors [CL, CD] for considering the so-called true Dirac
operator.
  However, it turns out that the method of the above references do not extend
to the case of positive (not equal to 1) values of q in the sense that the true
Dirac operator does not have bounded commutators with ""smooth"" algebra elements
in this case, in contrast to what happens for complex q of modulus 1.
Nevertheless, we show how to obtain the canonical volume form, i.e. the Haar
state, using the true Dirac operator.

space in the linear strand of a canonical curve C of even genus g=2k lying on a

the geometric syzygies constructed by Green and Lazarsfeld [1984] from
g^1_{k+1}'s form a non degenerate configuration of finitely many rational
normal curves on this P^{k+1}. This proves a natural generalization of Green's
conjecture [1984], namely that the geometric syzygies should span the space of
all syzygies, in this case.
