measurable by the space-based detector it LISA to large redshifts. This
suggests that LISA may be able to observe black holes grow and evolve as the
universe evolves, mapping the distribution of black hole masses as a function
of redshift. An immediate difficulty with this idea is that LISA measures
certain redshifted combinations of masses with good accuracy: if a system has
some mass parameter m, then LISA measures (1+z)m. This mass-redshift degeneracy
makes it difficult to follow the mass evolution. In many cases, LISA will also
measure the luminosity distance D of a coalescence accurately. Since
cosmological parameters (particularly the mean density, the cosmological
constant, and the Hubble constant) are now known with moderate precision, we
can obtain z from D and break the degeneracy. This makes it possible to
untangle the mass and redshift and to study the mass and merger history of
black holes. Mapping the black hole mass distribution could open a window onto
an early epoch of structure formation.

around the star HD 83443. The inner and more massive planet, HD 83443b, has the
smallest semi-major axis among all currently known exoplanets. Unlike other
short period exoplanets, it maintains a substantial orbital eccentricity,
e_1=0.079+/- 0.008, in spite of efficient tidal damping. This is a consequence
of its secular interactions with HD 83443c whose orbital eccentricity
e_2=0.42+/-0.06. Dissipation, associated with tides the star raises in the
inner planet, removes energy but not angular momentum from its orbit, while
secular interactions transfer angular momentum but not energy from the inner to
the outer planet's orbit. The outward transfer of angular momentum decreases
the tidal decay rate of the inner planet's orbital eccentricity while
increasing that of the outer planet. The alignment of the apsides of the
planets' orbits is another consequence of tidal and secular interactions. In
this state the ratio of their orbital eccentricities, e_1/e_2, depends upon the
secular perturbations the planets exert on each other and on additional
perturbations that enhance the inner planet's precession rate. Tidal and
rotational distortions of the inner planet along with general relativity
provide the most important of these extra precessional perturbations, each of
which acts to reduce e_1/e_2. Provided the planets' orbits are coplanar, the
observed eccentricity ratio uniquely relates sin i and
C=(k_2/k_{2J})(R_1/R_J)^5, where the tidal Love number, k_2, and radius, R_1,
of the inner planet are scaled by their Jovian equivalents.

low velocity INSs come to the stage of accretion. At this stage INS's period
evolution is governed by magnetic braking and angular momentum accreted. Since
the interstellar medium is turbulized accreted momentum can either accelerate

character.
  Our calculations show that in the case of constant magnetic field accreting
INSs have relatively long spin periods (some hours and more, depending on INS's

Such periods are much longer than the values measured by {\emph ROSAT} for 3

the disk-halo features (except for CO for which there is insufficient spatial
coverage). The HI features extend to about 7 kpc above the plane. In one case,
a loop is detected in position-velocity space, and are also observed over a
large velocity range. This implies that the disk-halo features represent
expanding supershells. However, the shells may be incomplete and partially
open-topped, suggesting that we are observing the breakup of the supershells as
they traverse the disk-halo interface. There is some evidence for acceleration
with z height and both redshifted and blueshifted velocities are present,
although the gas which is lagging with respect to galactic rotation dominates.
The radio continuum spectral index is flatter around the shell rims, suggesting
that shocks may be important in these regions (thermal contribution can not
account for this flattening). The H alpha emission is located interior to the
HI. For feature F3, the H alpha emission forms the interior ""skin"" of the HI
shell, yet there appears to be a minimum of in-disk star formation immediately
below the feature. We present a picture of a ""typical"" HI supershell which
accelerates and breaks up through the disk-halo interface. Such a feature is
likely internally generated via an energetic event in the disk.

generation of strongly twisted field lines in large scales. If it can work in
black hole magnetospheres, the global axisymmetric structure and the main

study the instability condition in the framework of the variational principle,
paying special attention to a stabilizing effect due to field-line rotation
against the screw-unstable modes satisfying the well-known Kruskal-Shafranov
criterion. The basic formulation for the stability analysis of rotating
force-free fields in Kerr geometry is provided. Then, for the practical use of
the analytical method, the stationary configuration is assumed to be
cylindrical, and we treat the long-wave mode perturbations excited at large
distances from the central black hole, where the strength of gravity becomes
negligibly small. This allows us to derive clearly the new criterion dependent
on the rotational angular velocity of magnetic field lines, and the
implications of the results obtained for magnetic activities of jets driven by
a black hole are briefly discussed.

observed in the only currently forming galaxies -- the so-called Tidal Dwarf
Galaxies, hereafter TDGs -- through observations of the molecular gas detected
via its CO emission. These objects are formed of material torn off of the outer
parts of a spiral disk due to tidal forces in a collision between two massive
galaxies. Molecular gas is a key element in the galaxy formation process,
providing the link between a cloud of gas and a bona fide galaxy. We have
detected CO in 8 TDGs (two of them have already been published in Braine et al.
2000), with an overall detection rate of 80%, showing that molecular gas is
abundant in TDGs, up to a few 10^8 M_sun. The CO emission coincides both
spatially and kinematically with the HI emission, indicating that the molecular
gas forms from the atomic hydrogen where the HI column density is high. A
possible trend of more evolved TDGs having greater molecular gas masses is
observed, in accord with the transformation of HI into H2.... Although higher
spatial resolution CO (and HI) observations would help reduce the
uncertainties, we find that TDGs require no dark matter, which would make them
the only galaxy-sized systems where this is the case. Dark matter in spirals
should then be in a halo and not a rotating disk. Most dwarf galaxies are dark
matter-rich, implying that they are not of tidal origin....

holes?"" in mind, we investigate the properties of such spheres from a classical
point of view. The investigation is carried out numerically by integrating the
Oppenheimer-Volkov equation for relativistic charged fluid spheres and finding
interior Reissner-Nordstr\""om solutions for these objects. We consider both
constant density and adiabatic equations of state, as well as several possible
charge distributions, and examine stability by both a normal mode and an energy
analysis. In all cases, the stability limit for these spheres lies between the
extremal ($Q = M$) limit and the black hole limit ($R = R_+$). That is, we find
that charged spheres undergo gravitational collapse before they reach $Q = M$,
suggesting that extremal Reissner-Nordtr\""om black holes produced by collapse
are ruled out. A general proof of this statement would support a strong form of
the cosmic censorship hypothesis, excluding not only stable naked
singularities, but stable extremal black holes. The numerical results also
indicate that although the interior mass-energy $m(R)$ obeys the usual $m/R <
4/9$ stability limit for the Schwarzschild interior solution, the gravitational
mass $M$ does not. Indeed, the stability limit approaches $R_+$ as $Q \to M$.
In the Appendix we also argue that Hawking radiation will not lead to an
extremal Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole. All our results are consistent with
the third law of black hole dynamics, as currently understood.

dimensional space-time with three ordinary and one time dimensions. We have
known for more than 70 years that (elementary) particles have spin degrees of
freedom, we also know that besides spin they also have charge degrees of
freedom, both degrees of freedom in addition to the position and momentum
degrees of freedom. We may call these ''internal degrees of freedom '' the
''internal space'' and we can think of all the different particles, like quarks
and leptons, as being different internal states of the same particle. The
question then naturally arises: Is the choice of the Minkowski metric and the
four-dimensional space-time influenced by the ''internal space''?
  Making assumptions (such as particles being in first approximation massless)
about the equations of motion, we argue for restrictions on the number of space
and time dimensions. (Actually the Standard model predicts and experiments
confirm that elementary particles are massless until interactions switch on
masses.)
  Accepting our explanation of the space-time signature and the number of

be haviour of the nuclear waste disposal process.The physical situation can be
described as an array made of high number of alveoles inside of a low permeable
layer (e.g. clay) included between two layers with slightly higher permeability
(e.g. limestone). Radioactive elements are leaking from their containers over a
period of time ]0,t_m[ . In a porous media (clay) there is a dilution effect
(similar to diffusion) and convection due to some underground water flow. The
real physical situation is simplified by replacing 5 alveoles by one macro
alveole and by considering the convection velocity as a given field. These
simplifications seam to be unimportant for understanding the global effects.
The typical size of such macro alveole is of order : 100 m width, 1000 m
length, 5 m hight. The distance between two alveoles is also of order 100 m.
The size of law permeable layer is of order 150 m hight, and 3000 length. Since
alveoles are small compared to the size of layer and their number is large
direct numerical simulations using the {\em microscopic} model is unrealistic.
On the other hand the ratio between domain length and the length of one alveole
is small, of order 1/30, and allows an asymptotic study with respect to that
small parameter, denoted by \epsilon, using the method of homogenization and
boundary layers.
