three decades in optical luminosity. Using a sub-sample of Seyfert galaxies,
which have black-hole mass estimates from both reverberation mapping and
stellar velocity dispersions, we investigate the geometry of the AGN broad-line
region (BLR). It is demonstrated that a model in which the orbits of the
line-emitting material have a flattened geometry is favoured over randomly
orientated orbits. Using this model we investigate the M_{bh}-L_{bulge}
relation for a combined 90-object sample, consisting of the AGN plus a sample
of 18 nearby inactive elliptical galaxies with dynamical black-hole mass
measurements. It is found that, for all reasonable mass-to-light ratios, the
M_{bh}-L_{bulge} relation is equivalent to a linear scaling between bulge and
black-hole mass. The best-fitting normalization of the M_{bh}-M_{bulge}
relation is found to be M_{bh}=0.0012M_{bulge}, in agreement with recent
black-hole mass studies based on stellar velocity dispersions. Furthermore, the
scatter around the M_{bh}-L_{bulge} relation for the full sample is found to be
significantly smaller than has been previously reported (Delta \log M_{bh}=0.39
dex). Finally, using the nearby inactive elliptical galaxy sample alone, it is
shown that the scatter in the M_{bh}-L_{bulge} relation is only 0.33 dex,
comparable to that of the M_{bh}-sigma relation. These results indicate that
reliable black-hole mass estimates can be obtained for high redshift galaxies.

objects suffer significant deformations during the passage of primary
gamma-rays through the intergalactic medium. The recently reported fluxes of
diffuse infrared background radiation indicate that we detect, most probably,
heavily absorbed TeV radiation from Mkn 421 and Mkn 501. This implies that the
absorption-corrected spectrum of Mkn 501 may contain a sharp pile-up which
contradicts to the predictions of the conventional models of TeV blazars, and
thus may leads to the so-called ""IR background-TeV gamma-ray crisis"". To
overcome this difficulty, in this paper we propose two independent hypotheses
assuming that (i) the TeV radiation from Mkn 501 has a secondary origin, i.e.
it is formed during the development of electron-photon cascades in the
intergalactic medium initiated by primary gamma-rays; (ii) the pile-up in the
source spectrum is a result of comptonization (in deep Klein-Nishina regime) of
ambient optical radiation by an ultrarelativistic conical cold outflow (jet)
with bulk motion Lorentz factor Gamma_0 >= 3 10^7. Within the uncertainties
caused by the limited energy resolution of spectral measurements, the observed
TeV radiation of Mkn 501 formally can be explained by the intergalactic cascade
gamma-rays, assuming however an extremely low intergalactic magnetic field in
the direction to the source at the level of < 10^{-18} G. We also demonstrate
that the ""bulk motion comptonization"" scenario can quite naturally reproduce
the unusual spectral features in the absorption-corrected TeV spectrum of Mkn
501, and briefly discuss the astrophysical implications of this hypothesis.

X-ray burst (the ``super burst'') observed by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer
(RXTE) from the low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) 4U 1820-30. This is the longest
X-ray burst ever observed from this source, and perhaps one of the longest ever
observed in great detail from any source. We show that the super burst is
thermonuclear in origin. The level of the accretion driven flux as well as the
total energy release of ~1.5 x 10^{42} ergs indicate that helium could not be
the energy source for the super burst. We outline the physics relevant to
carbon production and burning on helium accreting neutron stars and present
calculations of the thermal evolution and stability of a carbon layer and show
that this process is the most likely explanation for the super burst. We show
that for large columns of accreted carbon fuel, a substantial fraction of the
energy released in the carbon burning layer is radiated away as neutrinos, and
the heat that is conducted from the burning layer in large part flows inward,
only to be released on timescales longer than the observed burst. Thus the
energy released possibly exceeds that observed in X-rays by more than a factor
of ten. Spectral analysis during the super burst reveals the presence of a
broad emission line between 5.8 - 6.4 keV and an edge at 8 - 9 keV likely due
to reflection of the burst flux from the inner accretion disk in 4U 1820-30. We
believe this is the first time such a signature has been unambiguously detected
in the spectrum of an X-ray burst.

within a limited spatial regime and have average value zero. In addition to
their use as source characterizers, wavelet functions are rapidly gaining
currency within the source detection field. Wavelet-based source detection
involves the correlation of scaled wavelet functions with binned,
two-dimensional image data. If the chosen wavelet function exhibits the
property of vanishing moments, significantly non-zero correlation coefficients
will be observed only where there are high-order variations in the data; e.g.,
they will be observed in the vicinity of sources.
  In this paper, we describe the mission-independent, wavelet-based source
detection algorithm WAVDETECT, part of the CIAO software package. Aspects of
our algorithm include: (1) the computation of local, exposure-corrected
normalized (i.e. flat-fielded) background maps; (2) the correction for exposure
variations within the field-of-view; (3) its applicability within the
low-counts regime, as it does not require a minimum number of background counts
per pixel for the accurate computation of source detection thresholds; (4) the
generation of a source list in a manner that does not depend upon a detailed
knowledge of the point spread function (PSF) shape; and (5) error analysis.
These features make our algorithm considerably more general than previous
methods developed for the analysis of X-ray image data, especially in the low
count regime. We demonstrate the algorithm's robustness by applying it to
various images.

faint galaxies for three cosmological models for (1) the standard cold dark
matter (CDM) universe, (2) a low-density flat universe with nonzero
cosmological constant, and (3) a low-density open universe with zero
cosmological constant. The novelty of our SAM analysis is the inclusion of
selection effects arising from the cosmological dimming of surface brightness
of high-redshift galaxies, and also from the absorption of visible light by
internal dust and intergalactic \ion{H}{1} clouds. Contrary to previous SAM
analyses which do not take into account such selection effects, we find, from
comparison with observed counts and redshifts of faint galaxies in the Hubble
Deep Field (HDF), that the standard CDM universe is {\it not} preferred, and a
low-density universe either with or without cosmological constant is favorable,
as suggested by other recent studies. Moreover, we find that a simple
prescription for the time scale of star formation (SF), being proportional to
the dynamical time scale of the formation of the galactic disk, is unable to
reproduce the observed number- redshift relation for HDF galaxies, and that the
SF time scale should be nearly independent of redshift, as suggested by other
SAM analyses for the formation of quasars and the evolution of damped

in a $\Lambda$ dominated cold dark matter universe using a combination of
dissipationless N-body simulations and a semi-analytic galaxy formation model.
The N-body simulations enable us to calculate orbits of galaxies in simulated
clusters. Therefore we can incorporate stripping of cold gas from galactic
disks by ram pressure from intracluster medium into our model. In this paper we
study how ram pressure stripping (RPS) and small starburst induced by a minor
merger affect colors, star formation rates, and morphologies of cluster
galaxies. We find that the RPS is not important for colors and SFRs of galaxies
in the cluster core if star formation time-scale is properly chosen, because
the star formation is sufficiently suppressed by consumption of the cold gas in
the disks. Then observed color and SFR gradients can be reproduced without the
RPS. The small starburst triggered by a minor merger hardly affects the SFRs
and colors of the galaxies as well. We also examine whether these two processes
can resolve the known problem that the major merger-driven bulge formation
scenario predict too few galaxies of intermediate bulge-to-total luminosity
ratio (B/T) in clusters. When the minor burst is taken into account, the
intermediate B/T population is increased and the observed morphology gradients
in clusters are successfully reproduced. When the minor burst is considered,
the RPS also plays an important role in formation of the intermediate B/T
galaxies. We present redshift evolution of morphological fractions predicted by
our models. The predicted number ratios of the intermediate B/T galaxies to the
bulge-dominated galaxies show nearly flat or slightly increasing trends with
increasing redshift.

are much bluer than predicted by models suggesting that CO may be more abundant
in these objects than expected, as has been found for the T6 dwarf Gl 229B. We
also find that K-L' increases monotonically through most of the M, L, and T
subclasses, but it is almost constant between types L6 and T5. The degeneracy
is probably due to the onset of methane absorption at the blue edge of the L'
bandpass. The JHK colors of L dwarfs show significant scatter, suggesting that
the fluxes in these bandpasses are sensitive to variations in photospheric dust
properties. The H-K colors of the later T dwarfs also show some scatter which
we suggest is due to variations in pressure-induced molecular hydrogen opacity,
which is sensitive to gravity and metallicity.

Detailed calculations are presented of the equilibrium between heating by the
protons, electron thermal conduction, bremsstrahlung and multiple Compton
scattering in this layer. Its temperature is of the order 40-70 keV. Its
optical depth increases with the incident proton energy flux, and is of the
order unity for accretion at $10^{-2}$--$10^{-1}$ of the Eddington rate. At
these rates, the X-ray spectrum produced by the layer has a hard tail extending
to 100 keV, and is similar to the observed spectra of accreting neutron stars
in their hard states. The steep gradient at the base of the heated layer gives
rise to an excess of photons at the soft end of the spectrum (compared to a
blackbody) through an `inverse photosphere effect'. The differences with
respect to previous studies of similar problems are discussed, they are due
mostly to a more accurate treatment of the proton penetration process and the

density. If it is assumed that the space density of FR I radio galaxies at z>1
is similar to that found in the local universe, then the chance of finding two
FR I radio galaxies at these high radio powers in such a small area of sky is
<1%. This suggests that these objects were significantly more abundant at z>1
than at present, effectively ruling out the possibility that FR I radio sources
undergo no cosmological evolution. We suggest that FR I and FR II radio
galaxies should not be treated as intrinsically distinct classes of objects,
but that the cosmological evolution is simply a function of radio power with FR
I and FR II radio galaxies of similar radio powers undergoing similar
cosmological evolutions. Since low power radio galaxies have mainly FR I
morphologies and high power radio galaxies have mainly FR II morphologies, this
results in a generally stronger cosmological evolution for the FR IIs than the
FR Is. We believe that additional support from the V/Vmax test for evolving and
non-evolving populations of FR IIs and FR Is respectively is irrelevant, since
this test is sensitive over very different redshift ranges for the two classes.

curves which are inevitably stretched by cosmological time dilation. We
construct the empirical relation using both individual PDSs and averaged PDSs.
An error estimates of $z$ are 1.09 and 1.11 for the empirical relation by

absorption bands at 1.15um and 1.4um, the latter of which shows a smooth
increase in depth through the L and T sequences and can be used to classify
both spectral types. The other two indices make use of methane absorption
features in the H and K bands, with the K band index also applicable to mid to
late L dwarfs. Continuum indices shortward of 1um used by previous authors to
classify L dwarfs are found to be useful only through mid L subclasses. We
employ the 1.5um water index and the 2.2um methane index to complete the L
classification through L9.5 and to link the new system with a modified version
of the 2MASS ``Color-d'' index. By correlating the depths of the methane and
water absorption features, we establish a T spectral sequence from types T0 to
T8, based on all four indices, which is a smooth continuation of the L
sequence. We reclassify two 2MASS L8 dwarfs as L9 and L9.5 and identify one

relativistic pair fireball, converting its internal energy into kinetic energy
of a relativistically moving plasmoid and subsequently into radiation. Here, we
investigate the early stages of this evolution, after the pair fireball has
become optically thin to gamma-gamma pair production. We show that for a short
period of time, ~ 0.1 - a few seconds after the initial explosion, the pair
plasmoid evolution might be dominated by collisional processes prior to the
formation of a collisionless shock. We simulate these processes during the
early pair plasmoid evolution and calculate the expected radiative signatures.
We show that the radiation from the collision-dominated pair plasmoid phase
results in a short (~ a few ms) flash of thermal soft X-ray emission, followed
by a transition phase of < 1 s during which the fireball turns Thomson thin,
but its radiation remains dominated by thermal Comptonization, peaking at
around E_pk ~ 100 MeV - a few GeV. While the very early thermal emission could
be associated with the quasi-thermal radiation signatures found in the very
early phases of several bright BATSE GRBs, the predicted subsequent flash of
high-energy emission should be easily detectable with the GLAST satellite.

collisions with thermal photons and with the matter of the envelope, mainly via
pion production. When the temperature of the radiation inside the envelope of

losing energy and produce high energy neutrinos. We estimate the flux of muon
neutrinos emitted during such an early phase of the pulsar - supernova envelope

neutrinos above 1 TeV within about one year after the explosion from a
supernova in our Galaxy. This result holds if these pulsars are able to
efficiently accelerate nuclei to energies $\sim 10^{20}$ eV, as postulated

transition via the appearance of a critical endpoint. A semi-quantitative
discussion is given in terms of recent experiments on MnSi and UGe_2. It is
then shown that the critical temperature for spin-triplet, p-wave
superconductivity mediated by spin fluctuations is generically much higher in a

  Many features of real granular fluids under rapid flow are replicated by a
system of smooth hard spheres with inelastic collisions. For such a system, it
is tempting to apply standard methods of kinetic theory and hydrodynamics to
calculate properties of interest. The domain of validity for such methods is a
priori uncertain due to the inelasticity, but recent systemmatic studies
continue to support the utility of kinetic theory and hydrodynamics as both
qualitative and quantitative descriptions for many physical states. The current
status of kinetic theory and hydrodynamics is reviewed and interpreted, with
the optimistic conclusion that much existing phenomenology can be placed on
firm grounds for further understanding of complex states observed in rapid
granular flow.

scattering by a conduction band quantum plasma taking into account the presence
of the filled valence band in doped semiconductor nanostructures within a
generalized resonant random phase approximation (RPA). Our generalized RPA
theory explicitly incorporates the two-step resonance process where an electron
from the filled valence band is first excited by the incident photon into the
conduction band before an electron from the conduction band falls back into the
valence band emitting the scattered photon. We show that when the incident
photon energy is close to a resonance energy, i.e. the valence-to-conduction
band gap of the semiconductor structure, the Raman scattering spectral weight
at single particle excitation energies may be substantially enhanced even for
long wavelength excitations, and may become comparable to the spectral weight
of collective charge density excitations (plasmon). Away from resonance, i.e.
when the incident photon energy is different from the band gap energy, plasmons
dominate the Raman scattering spectrum. We find no qualitative difference in
the resonance effects on the Raman scattering spectra among systems of
different dimensionalities (one, two and three) within RPA. This is explained
by the decoherence effect of the resonant interband transition on the
collective motion of conduction band electrons. Our theoretical calculations
agree well (qualitatively and semi-quantitatively) with the available
experimental results, in contrast to the standard nonresonant RPA theory which
predicts vanishing long wavelength Raman spectral weight for single particle
excitations.

discussed within the framework of a simple mass transfer model first introduced
by K.H. Andersen et al. [Phys. Rev. E 63, 066308 (2001)]. Two scenarios for the
selection of the final pattern are identified. When the initial state is
homogeneous with uniform random perturbations, a unique final state is reached
which depends only on the shape of the interaction function $f(\lambda)$. A
potential formulation of the dynamics suggests that the final wavelength is
determined by a Maxwell construction applied to $f(\lambda)$, but comparison
with numerical simulations shows that this yields only an upper bound. In
contrast, the evolution from a perfectly homogeneous state with a localized
perturbation proceeds through the propagation of wavelength doubling fronts.
The front speed can be predicted by standard marginal stability theory. In this
case the final wavelength depends on the initial wavelength in a complicated
manner which involves multiplication by factors of 2 and rational ratios such
as 4/3.

solutions along classical antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chains at low
energies. The equation of motion is derived and found to have long range
position- and velocity-dependent two-body forces. A 'quiescent' regime is
identified where the forces between walls are all repelling. Outside this
regime some of the interactions are attractive, giving rise to wall collisions
whereupon the colliding walls annihilate. The momentum of the system is found
to be conserved in the quiescent regime and to suffer discontinuous jumps upon
annihilation. The dynamics are illustrated by an exact solution for a double
wall system and a numerical solution for a many-wall system.
  On circular chains the equations support stable periodic stripes that can
rotate as a rigid body. It is found that the stripes are more stable the faster
they rotate. The periodic structure can be destabilised by perturbing the
walls' angular velocity in which case there is a transition to another periodic
structure, possibly via a cascade of annihilation events.

orbifold and an orientifold of Type II is considered. The D-branes of the
orbifold theory (that were recently determined by Gutperle) are all non-BPS and
do not carry any conserved gauge charges. It is shown that they carry
non-trivial K-theory charges, and that they can be understood in terms of
branes wrapping certain homology classes of the M-theory compactification.
Using the adiabatic argument, dual partners of some of these non-BPS D-branes
are proposed. The relations between these dual states are found to be in
agreement with the M-theory description of the D-branes.

Chiral symmetry is restored at high energy density, corresponding to large
black holes. But the entropy of the black hole solutions decreases as one
proceeds to higher temperatures, indicating that there is a thermodynamic
instability and that the canonical ensemble is ill-defined. For certain limits

two-dimensional sphere as extra dimensions. The Dirac-Wu-Yang monopole is set
in two-sphere S^2 as a background gauge field. The nontrivial topology of the
monopole induces topological defects, i.e. vortices. When the radius of S^2 is
larger than a critical radius, the scalar field develops a vacuum expectation
value and creates vortices in S^2. Then the vortices break the rotational
symmetry of S^2. We exactly evaluate the critical radius as r_q =
\sqrt{|q|}/\mu, where q is the monopole number and \mu is the imaginary mass of
the scalar. We show that the vortices repel each other. We analyze the vacua of
the models with one scalar field in each case of q=1/2, 1, 3/2 and find that:
when q=1/2, a single vortex exists; when q=1, two vortices sit at diametrical
points on S^2; when q=3/2, three vortices sit at the vertices of the largest
triangle on S^2. The symmetry of the model G = U(1) x SU(2) x CP is broken to
H_{1/2} = U(1)', H_{1} = U(1)'' x CP, H_{3/2} = D_{3h}, respectively. Here
D_{3h} is the symmetry group of a regular triangle. We extend our analysis to
the doublet scalar fields and show that the symmetry is broken from G_{doublet}
= U(1) x SU(2) x SU(2)_f x P to H_{doublet} = SU(2)' x P. Finally we obtain the
exact vacuum of the model with the multiplet (q_1, q_2,..., q_{2j+1}) = (j,
j,..., j) and show that the symmetry is broken from G_{multiplet} = U(1) x

that a careful analysis of dynamics of the topological defects is required for

finite dimensional ``windows'' spanned by finite subsequences having length
equal to the degree of one or the other of the polynomials V_1, V_2. The
vectors formed by such subsequences satisfy ""dual pairs"" of first order systems
of linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients, having rank
equal to one of the degrees of V_1 or V_2 and degree equal to the other. They
also satisfy recursion relations connecting the consecutive windows, and
deformation equations, determining how they change under variations in the

their measure representation. The measures are shown to be random cascades
generated by an infinitely divisible distribution. This probability
distribution is uniquely determined by the exponent function in the
multifractal theory of random cascades. Curve fitting to a large number of
complete genomes of bacteria indicates that the Gamma density function provides
an excellent fit to the exponent function, and hence to the probability
distribution of the complete genomes.

E, Vol. 64, 031903 (2001)","10.1103/PhysRevE.64.031903",,"physics.bio-ph q-bio",,"  This paper introduces the notion of measure representation of DNA sequences.
Spectral analysis and multifractal analysis are then performed on the measure
representations of a large number of complete genomes. The main aim of this
paper is to discuss the multifractal property of the measure representation and
the classification of bacteria. From the measure representations and the values
of the $D_{q}$ spectra and related $C_{q}$ curves, it is concluded that these
complete genomes are not random sequences. In fact, spectral analyses performed
indicate that these measure representations considered as time series, exhibit
strong long-range correlation. For substrings with length K=8, the $D_{q}$
spectra of all organisms studied are multifractal-like and sufficiently smooth
for the $C_{q}$ curves to be meaningful. The $C_{q}$ curves of all bacteria
resemble a classical phase transition at a critical point. But the 'analogous'
phase transitions of chromosomes of non-bacteria organisms are different. Apart
from Chromosome 1 of {\it C. elegans}, they exhibit the shape of double-peaked
specific heat function.

bubbles levitated in a liquid are discussed. Using a linear coupled-oscillator
model, it is shown theoretically that when the system contains $N$ bubbles of
different sizes, each bubble has $2N - 1$ (or less) transition frequencies
which make the phase difference between an external sound and a bubble's
pulsation $\pi / 2$. Furthermore, we discuss a discrepancy appearing between
the present result regarding the transition frequencies and existing ones for
the resonance frequencies in a two-bubble case, and show that the transition
frequency, defined as above, and the resonance frequency have a different
physical meaning when $N \ge 2$, while they are consistent for $N = 1$.

decoherence in consequence of quantum complementarity and entanglement.
Utilizing the phase selective manipulations with enviroment, it is demonstrated
how the complementarity particularly induces a preservation of visibility,
whereas quantum decoherence is more progressive due to pronounced entanglement
between system and enviroment. This effect can be directly observed using the
proposed cavity QED measurements.

quantization if dynamical operator is an operator of multiplication on a

and provides information in form of the choice of a measurement result from all
possible measurement results. If infinitely many (different) measurement
results would be possible, the choice of a measurement result could deliver an
infinite quantity of information. But the results of physical measurings (of
finite duration) never deliver an infinite quantity of information, they
describe past, finite reality. Therefore the set of all possible measurement
results a priori is finite. In the physical reality only a finite information
quantity can be processed within a finite time interval. For mathematical
models whose representation requires a processing of an infinite quantity of
information, for example irrational numbers, no (exact) equivalent exists in
the physical reality. So mathematical calculations, which have an equivalent in
physical reality, can include only rational (finitely many elementary)
combinations of rational numbers. Conclusions arise from this for the
foundations of mathematical physics.
