Donato et al. (2001) to the $\beta$-radioactive nuclei $^{10}$Be, $^{26}$Al and
$^{36}$Cl. These species are be shown to be particularly sensitive to the
properties of the local interstellar medium (LISM). As studies of the LISM
suggest that we live in an underdense bubble of extent $r_{hole} \sim 50 - 200
\unit{pc}$, this local feature must be taken into account. We present a
modified version of our diffusion model which describes the underdensity as a
hole in the galactic disc. It is found that the presence of the bubble leads to
a decrease in the radioactive fluxes which can be approximated by a simple
factor $\exp(-r_{hole}/l_{rad})$ where $l_{rad}=\sqrt{K \gamma \tau_0}$ is the
typical distance travelled by a radioactive nucleus before it decays. We find
that each of the radioactive nuclei independently point towards a bubble radius
$\lesssim 100 \unit{pc}$. If these nuclei are considered simultaneously, only
models with a bubble radius $r_{hole} \sim 60 - 100 \unit{pc}$ are marginally
consistent with data. In particular, the standard case $r_{hole}=0 \unit{pc}$
is disfavoured. Our main concern is about the consistency of the currently
available data, especially $^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al.

should be constant along streamlines to prevent compressional (PdV) work from
being done cyclically around every orbit. In a pure Kepler potential, flow
along aligned, elliptical streamlines of constant eccentricity will satisfy
this condition. For most density profiles, differential precession driven by
the pressure gradient will destroy the alignment; however, in the razor-thin
approximation there is a family of simple equilibria in which the precession
frequency is the same at all radii. These disks may therefore be long-lived at
significant eccentricities. The density can be made axisymmetric as r goes to
0, while maintaining the precession rate, by relaxing the requirement of
constancy along streamlines in an arbitrarily small transition region near the
center. In the limit of small eccentricity, the models can be seen as
acoustically perturbed axisymmetric disks, and the precession rate is shown to
agree with linear theory. The perturbation is a traveling wave similar to an
ocean wave, with the fluid rising and falling epicyclically in the
gravitational field of the central mass. The expected emission line profiles
from the eccentric disks are shown to be strongly asymmetric in general, and,
in extreme cases, prone to misinterpretation as single narrow lines with
significant velocity offsets.

hump' component at energies <2 keV shows flux variations on timescales down to
1 day that are well correlated with the photon index and the 2-10 keV band
flux. A broad Fe K$\alpha$ emission is detected. There is a evidence for a
narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line at ~6.8 keV, indicating an origin in ionized material.
We do not detect significant variations of the line flux or EW on ~1 day-1 week
timescales. The softness ratio reveals spectral variability on timescales down
to ~1000 s, indicating that the power-law continuum and soft hump fluxes are
not well correlated on this timescale. It also shows a slow decline across the
observation, due to a combination of the different time-variability of the
power-law continuum and soft hump flux on timescales of ~1 week. The X-ray
emission originates within 12 Schwarzschild radii, and the amplitudes and
timescales of the rapid variations we observed are consistent with those
expected within disk-corona models. The soft hump variability timescale rules
out an origin in large scale components (circumnuclear starburst). The
$\Gamma$-soft hump correlation is consistent with the soft hump being produced
by up-scattering of the accretion disk radiation within a flaring disk corona.

  (minor changes)","Astron.J. 122 (2001) 2850","10.1086/324231",,"astro-ph",,"  We present moderate resolution Keck spectroscopy of quasars at z=5.82, 5.99
and 6.28, discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that the
Ly Alpha absorption in the spectra of these quasars evolves strongly with
redshift. To z~5.7, the Ly Alpha absorption evolves as expected from an
extrapolation from lower redshifts. However, in the highest redshift object,
SDSSp J103027.10+052455.0 (z=6.28), the average transmitted flux is
0.0038+-0.0026 times that of the continuum level over 8450 A < lambda < 8710 A
(5.95<z(abs)<6.16), consistent with zero flux. Thus the flux level drops by a
factor of >150, and is consistent with zero flux in the Ly Alpha forest region
immediately blueward of the Ly Alpha emission line, compared with a drop by a
factor of ~10 at z(abs)~5.3. A similar break is seen at Ly Beta; because of the
decreased oscillator strength of this transition, this allows us to put a
considerably stronger limit, tau(eff) > 20, on the optical depth to Ly Alpha
absorption at z=6.
  This is a clear detection of a complete Gunn-Peterson trough, caused by
neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium. Even a small neutral hydrogen
fraction in the intergalactic medium would result in an undetectable flux in
the Ly Alpha forest region. Therefore, the existence of the Gunn-Peterson
trough by itself does not indicate that the quasar is observed prior to the
reionization epoch. However, the fast evolution of the mean absorption in these
high-redshift quasars suggests that the mean ionizing background along the line
of sight to this quasar has declined significantly from z~5 to 6, and the
universe is approaching the reionization epoch at z~6.

significant. This variation in the color of the giant branch corresponds to a
metallicity variation of about -0.25 Dex. The existence of a metallicity

Draco's red giants, red horizontal branch stars and subgiants down to i=21.7
mag does not provide evidence for the existence of tidally induced tails or a
halo of unbound stars. The radial profile can be fit by King models as well as
by a generalized exponential. The core radius and the limiting (or tidal)
radius along the major axis are 7.7' and 40.1', respectively, making Draco 40%
larger than previously measured. Down to our magnitude limit tidal effects can
only exist at a level of 10^-3 of the central surface density of Draco or
below. The regular structure of Draco found from the new data argues against it
being a portion of an unbound tidal stream and lends support to the assumption
of dynamical equilibrium. We estimate Draco's total mass to be 2.2 - 3.5 times
10^7 solar masses. We obtain an overall mass-to-light ratio of 146+-42 or
92+-28 solar masses depending on the details of the mass and luminosity

outflows that should have a profound effect on the structure and kinematics of
both the galaxies themselves and their environment. The interstellar absorption
spectra of both Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and local starburst galaxies are
remarkably similar to those of damped Ly-alpha (DLA) systems in QSO spectra.
Their rest-frame UV spectra typically show broad, blueshifted Ly-alpha
absorption accompanied by low-ionization metallic absorption lines with complex
profiles. Hydrodynamical simulations of galactic winds suggest that the
absorption arises in a collection of dense clouds entrained in the hot wind
and/or in shells swept up by the outflow. It seems likely that outflows would
also give rise to DLA absorption when seen in absorption against a background
QSO. It is emphasized that some differences are expected between the properties
of DLA systems in the emission weighted galaxy spectra, which always probe the
centers of star formation, and those in random sight lines through the outflow.
The observed LBGs alone can account for all DLA absorption at z ~ 3 if the
cross section for DLA absorption is pi*r^2 with r = 19 h^{-1} kpc. If the cross
section is smaller than this, then the fraction of DLA systems arising in
outflows could still be significant if there are many wind-driving galaxies
below the current detection limits. This is certainly possible since the z=3
luminosity function is still rising down to the detection limit of 0.1 L_star
and observations and simulations of local dwarf galaxies indicate that many of
these fainter galaxies drive winds as well.

with small libration amplitudes. The libration of both lowest order mean-motion
resonance variables, theta_1 and theta_2, and the secular resonance variable,
theta_3, about 0 deg. differs from the familiar geometry of the Io-Europa pair,
where theta_2 and theta_3 librate about 180 deg. By considering a condition for
stable simultaneous librations of theta_1 and theta_2, we show that the GJ 876
geometry results because of the large orbital eccentricities e_i, whereas the
very small e_i in the Io-Europa system lead to the latter's geometry.
Surprisingly, the GJ 876 resonance configuration remains stable for e_1 up to
0.86 and for amplitude of libration of theta_1 approaching 45 deg. with the
current e_i. We find that inward migration of the outer planet of the GJ 876

<0.06 and e_2<0.03 and the migration rate |(da_2/dt)/a_2| < 0.03(a_2/AU)^{-3/2}
yr^{-1}. The bound on the migration rate is easily satisfied by migration due
to planet-nebula interaction. If there is no eccentricity damping, eccentricity
growth is rapid with continued migration within the resonance, with e_i
exceeding the observed values after a further reduction in the semi-major axes
a_i of only 7%. With eccentricity damping (de_i/dt)/e_i = -K|(da_i/dt)/a_i|,
the e_i reach equilibrium values that remain constant for arbitrarily long
migration within the resonances. The equilibrium e_i are close to the observed
e_i for K=100 (K=10) if there is migration and damping of the outer planet only

produce the large value of K required to obtain the observed eccentricities.

solution of this problem involves stellar feedback. A strong baryonic wind
driven by vigorous star formation can remove a large fraction of the gas,
causing the dark matter to expand. We explore the maximum effect of the
feedback with an instantaneous removal of the gaseous disk. The energy input
depends on the compactness of the disk, hence the specific angular momentum of
the disk. For the plausible cosmological parameters and a large range of the
disk angular momentum, the feedback is insufficient to destroy the central halo
cusp, while the inner density is lowered only by a modest factor of 2 to 6. Any
realistic modeling of the feedback would have even lesser impact on dark

from the SM due to an additional flavour changing structure beyond the CKM
matrix. We analyze the compatibility of this model with present data and
suggest specific tests in forthcoming experiments in B physics. In addition to
the CP-asymmetries in B-meson decays and the Bs-bar(Bs) mass difference, we
emphasize measurements of the radiative transition b -> d gamma as sensitive
probes of the postulated flavour changing structure. Interestingly, the
CKM-unitarity analysis in these models also allows solutions with gamma > pi/2,
where gamma=-arg(Vub). Such large values of gamma are hinted by the current
measurements of the branchig ratios for the decays B -> pi pi and B -> K pi.

Since our CWBA model contains the electromagnetic interaction between the core
and the target nucleus to all orders, this means that higher order effects
(including postacceleration effects) are small in the case of high beam
energies and forward scattering. Our model also predicts a scaling behavior of
the differential cross section, that is, different systems (with different
binding energies, beam energies and scattering angles) show the same dependence
on two variables x and y.

properties associated with the folding of DNA into nucleosomes and chromatin is
presented. For this purpose experimentally determined elastic constants of
linear DNA and a simple fold geometry are assumed to derive constants for the
higher order folding. The model predicts the correct order of magnitude for the
experimentally determined Young's and shear modulus of condensed chromatin.
Thus we have demonstrated that the elastic properties of DNA are the primary
determinant of the elastic properties of each folded state. The derived elastic
constants are then used to predict the speed of propagation of small amplitude
waves. It is shown that extension/compression, twist, bend or shear waves can
be excite in each folded state.

development of several new technologies, e.g. single-spin transistors and
solid-state quantum computation. Magnetic resonance force microscopy with a
cyclic adiabatic inversion, which utilizes a cantilever oscillations driven by

the quantum dynamics of a single spin interacting with a quasiclassical
cantilever. It was found that in a similar fashion to the Stern-Gerlach
interferometer the quantum dynamics generates a quantum superposition of two
quasiclassical trajectories of the cantilever which are related to the two spin
projections on the direction of the effective magnetic field in the rotating
reference frame. Our results show that quantum jumps will not prevent a
single-spin measurement if the coupling between the cantilever vibrations and
the spin is small in comparison with the amplitude of the radio-frequency
external field.

which macroscopic patterns are both initiated and sustained by quantum noise.
Familiar methods based linearization about a pseudo-classical field fail in
this regime and new approaches are required. We employ a method in which the
pump field is treated as a $c$-number variable but is driven by the $c$-number
representation of the quantum sub-harmonic signal field. This allows us to
include the effects of the fluctuations in the signal on the pump, which in
turn act back on the signal. We find that the non-classical effects, in the
form of squeezing, survive just above the threshold of the convective regime.
Further above threshold the macroscopic quantum noise suppresses these effects.
