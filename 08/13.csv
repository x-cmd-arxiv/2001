in a differentially rotating star. A magnetic instability in the toroidal field
(wound up by differential rotation) replaces the role of convection in closing
the field amplification loop. Tayler instability is likely to be the most
relevant magnetic instability. A dynamo model is developed from these
ingredients, and applied to the problem of angular momentum transport in
stellar interiors. It produces a prodominantly horizontal field. This dynamo
process might account for the observed pattern of rotation in the solar core.

disk-accreting magnetic neutron star and a very low mass, hydrogen-depleted
companion in a 42-min binary. We have resolved the previously reported Ne/O
emission line complex near 1 keV into Doppler pairs of broadened (2500 km/s
FWHM) lines from highly ionized Ne and O. In most cases, the blue and red line
components are of comparable strength, with blueshifts of 1550-2610 km/s and
redshifts of 770-1900 km/s. The lines appear to originate in hot (10^6 K),
dense material just below the X-ray-heated skin of the outer Keplerian
accretion disk, or else possibly in a disk wind driven from the pulsar's
magnetopause. The observed photoelectric absorption edges of Ne and O appear
nearly an order of magnitude stronger than expected from interstellar material
and are likely formed in cool, metal-rich material local to the source. Based
on the inferred local abundance ratios, we argue that the mass donor in this
binary is probably the 0.02 M_sun chemically fractionated core of a C-O-Ne or
O-Ne-Mg white dwarf which has previously crystallized.

the two components cannot be perfectly separated in an incomplete sky map. We
also present a simple approximation scheme that accounts for mixing of E and B

components increases the difficulty of detecting the subdominant B component by
a factor of two or more in observing time; however, for larger survey sizes the
effect of mixing is less pronounced. Surprisingly, mixing of E and B components
can enhance the detectability of the E component by increasing the effective

the angular sizes $\theta_T\sim$10 angular seconds in range of the wavelength
0.1 cm$\leq\lambda\leq$1 cm. The expected number density and frequency
dependence of the amplitude permit to recognize this effect and to discriminate
it from the noise. This method applied to the small scale variations of CMB
temperature complements well the traditional spectral approach.
  The number density and the amplitude of observed 'negative' intensity patches
depend upon the redshift of reionization that allow to estimate roughly this
redshift. The ionized bubbles formed just before the period of reionization
could also be seen as the highest peaks. The expected results are sensitive to
the Jeans scale at the period of reionization, to the small scale shape of the

improvement, we further use the `duration' of the event and the signal-to-noise

microlensing events. We have discovered one convincing new candidate,
sc33_4505, and seven other marginal cases. The convincing candidate (sc33_4505)
is caused by a slow-moving, and likely low-mass, object, similar to other known
parallax events. We found that irregular sampling and gaps between observing
seasons hamper the recovery of parallax events. We have also searched for
long-duration events that do not show parallax signatures. The lack of parallax
effects in a microlensing event puts a lower-limit on the Einstein radius
projected onto the observer plane, which in turn imposes a lower limit on the
lens mass divided by the relative lens-source parallax. Most of the constraints

longitudinal polarization ($P_L$) of the muon is proportional to the direct CP
violating amplitude. On the other hand the energy asymmetry and the
out-of-plane polarization ($P_N$) depend on both indirect and direct CP
violating amplitudes. Although the branching ratio is small and difficult to
measure because of background, the asymmetries could be large $\cal{O}$(1) in
the Standard Model. A combined analysis of the energy asymmetry, $P_L$ and
$P_N$ could be used to separate indirect CPV, direct CPV, and CP conserving
contributions to the decay.

Homestake detector, after subtraction of the signal from boron neutrinos, gives
the flux of Be+CNO neutrinos, and $P_{ee}$ for the corresponding energy

Gallium detectors, GALLEX, SAGE and GNO, detect additionally pp-neutrinos. The
pp-flux can be calculated subtracting from the gallium signal the rate due to
boron, beryllium and CNO neutrinos. The ratio of the measured $pp$-neutrino
flux to that predicted by the SSM gives the survival probability for

best option to tackle CP violation, although a combination of two baselines

the interaction length changes in the point of roots degeneration. This leads
to the sharp decrease of start current if condition of dynamical diffraction is
fulfilled. The dependence of amplification coefficient changes, too. So the
interaction length for generation appears shorter. The proposed scheme can be
used for generation in wide spectral range from microwaves to X-rays. The
operating features of undulator VFEL is considered.

whenever the so-called ``qubit space'' is not afflicted with Heisenberg
Uncertainty. It turns out that all optical experimental realizations of EPR's

states pointed out. In the vicinity of such singular points the phase changes
sharply and precisely at these points it becomes undefined. A closed circuit in
the parameter space around such points results in a measurable phase shift
equal to 2n\pi, where n is an integer. Such effects have earlier been observed
in interference experiments with pure polarization states of light, a system
isomorphic to the spin-1/2 system in quantum mechanics. Implications of phase
singularities for the interpretation of experiments with partially polarized
and unpolarized neutrons are discussed. New kinds of topological phases
involving variables representing decoherence (depolarization) of pure states
