stellar population analyses and spatial information of both Magellanic Clouds
(MCs). The Magellanic Clouds - especially the LMC with its large size and small
depth (<300pc) - are suitable laboratories and testing ground for theoretical
models of star formation. With distance moduli of 18.5 and 18.9mag for the LMC
and SMC, respectively, and small galactic extinction, their stellar content can
be studied in detail from the most massive stars of the youngest populations
(<25Myr) connected to H-alpha emission down to the low mass end of about 1/10
of a solar mass. Based on broad-band photometry (U,B,V) I present results for
the supergiant shell (SGS) SMC1, some regions at the LMC east side incl. LMC2
showing different overlapping young populations and the region around N171 with
its large and varying colour excess, and LMC4. This best studied SGS shows a
coeval population aged about 12Myr with little age spread and no correlation to
distance from LMC4's centre. I will show that the available data are not
compatible with many of the proposed scenarios like SSPSF or a central trigger
(like a cluster or GRB), while a large-scale trigger like the bow-shock of the
rotating LMC can do the job.

periodic and non-periodic variability; at least 15% of these sources appear to
be variable on a time scale of several months. We discovered a new bright
transient source ~2.9' from the nucleus in the June observation; this source
faded significantly and was no longer detected in December. The behaviour of
the object is similar to a handful of Galactic LMXB transients, most of which
are supposed to harbor black holes. We detected pulsations with a period of
\~865 s from a source with a supersoft spectrum. The flux of this source
decreased significantly between the two XMM observations. The detected period
is unusually short and points to a rapidly spinning magnetized white dwarf. The
high luminosity and transient nature of the source suggest its possible
identification with classical or symbiotic nova, some of which were observed
earlier as supersoft sources.

from high-redshift quasars. We describe the discovery of three new quasars, at
z=5.82, 5.99 and 6.28, respectively. Their spectra show strong and broad Ly
alpha+NV emission lines, and very strong Ly alpha absorption, with a mean
continuum decrement D_A > 0.90. The ARC 3.5m spectrum of the z=6.28 quasar
shows that over a range of 300 A immediately blueward of the Ly alpha emission,
the average transmitted flux is only 0.003 +/-0.020 times that of the continuum
level, consistent with zero flux, and suggesting a tentative detection of the
complete Gunn-Peterson trough. The existence of strong metal lines suggests
early chemical enrichment in the quasar enviornment. The three new objects,
together with the previously published z=5.8 quasar form a complete

discuss the contribution of quasars to the ionizing background at z~6. The
luminous quasars discussed in the paper have central black hole masses of
several times 10^9 M_sun by the Eddington argument. Their observed space
density provides a sensitive test of models of quasar and galaxy formation at

Using Hydro-PM simulations, I compute the three-dimensional power spectrum of
the Lyman-alpha forest flux, P_F(k,mu), from which the redshift-space
anisotropy of the correlation can be obtained. I find that box size ~40 Mpc/h
and resolution ~40 Kpc/h are necessary for convergence of the calculations to
<5% on all relevant scales, although somewhat poorer resolution can be used for
large scales. I compute directly the linear theory bias parameters of the
Lyman-alpha forest, potentially allowing simulation results to be extended to
arbitrarily large scales. I investigate the dependence of P_F(k,mu) on the
primordial power spectrum, the temperature-density relation of the gas, and the
mean flux decrement, finding that the redshift-space anisotropy is relatively
insensitive to these parameters. A table of results is provided for different
parameter variations. I investigate the constraint that can be obtained on
Omega_Lambda using quasars from a large survey. Assuming 13 (theta/1')^2 pairs
at separation <theta, and including separations <10', a measurement to <5% can
be made if simulations can predict the redshift-space anisotropy with <5%
accuracy, or to <10% if the anisotropy must be measured from the data. The
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) will obtain spectra for a factor ~5 fewer pairs
than this, so followup observations of fainter pair candidates will be
necessary. I discuss the requirements on spectral resolution and
signal-to-noise ratio (SDSS-quality spectra are sufficient).

H2-cooling in cosmological minihalos with virial temperatures of a few 1000K.
However, their abundance is likely to have been severely limited by feedback
processes which suppressed H2 formation. The formation of the protogalaxies
responsible for reionization and metal-enrichment of the intergalactic medium,
then had to await the collapse of larger halos. Here we investigate the
radiative cooling and collapse of gas in halos with virial temperatures Tvir >
10^4K. In these halos, efficient atomic line radiation allows rapid cooling of
the gas to 8000 K; subsequently the gas can contract nearly isothermally at
this temperature. Without an additional coolant, the gas would likely settle
into a locally gravitationally stable disk; only disks with unusually low spin
would be unstable. However, we find that the initial atomic line cooling leaves
a large, out-of-equilibrium residual free electron fraction. This allows the
molecular fraction to build up to a universal value of about x(H2) = 10^-3,
almost independently of initial density and temperature. We show that this is a
non--equilibrium freezeout value that can be understood in terms of timescale
arguments. Furthermore, unlike in less massive halos, H2 formation is largely
impervious to feedback from external UV fields, due to the high initial
densities achieved by atomic cooling. The H2 molecules cool the gas further to
about 100K, and allow the gas to fragment on scales of a few 100 Msun. We
investigate the importance of various feedback effects such as
H2-photodissociation from internal UV fields and radiation pressure due to
Ly-alpha photon trapping, which are likely to regulate the efficiency of star

volume ($\omega $) magnetostriction properties of Pr$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$MnO$_3$
were investigated. The LTE decreases smoothly from 300 K without a clear
anomaly either around the Curie (T$_C$ = 270 K) or the Neel temperature (T$_N$

upon warming. Isothermal magnetization study suggests that 13 % of the
ferromagnetic phase coexists with 87 % of the antiferromagnetic phase at 25 K.
The parallel and perpendicular magnetostrictions undergo rapid changes during
the metamagnetic transition. Contrary to the isotropic giant volume
magnetostriction reported in manganites so far, this compound exhibits a giant
anisotropic magnetostriction ($\lambda_t \approx 10^{-3}$) and smaller volume
($\omega \approx 10^{-4}$) magnetostrictions below T$_N$. We suggest that the
field induced antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic transition is accompanied by a
structural transition from the d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital ordered antiferromagnetic
(orthorhombic) to the orbital disordered ferromagnetic (tetragonal) phase. The
metamagnetic transition proceeds through nucleation and growth of the
ferromagnetic domains at the expense of the antiferromagnetic phase. The
preferential orientation of the ferromagnetic (tetragonal) domains along the
field direction increases the linear dimension of the sample in the field
direction and decreases in the orthogonal direction leading to the observed
giant anisotropic magnetostriction effect. Our study also suggests that
nanodomains of the low temperature antiferromagnetic phase possibly exist in
the temperature region T$_N$ < T < T$_C$.

arrive at a very promising variational approximation method. Within the Local
Potential Approximation, we construct a function, C, of the coupling constants;
it has the property that (for unitary theories) it decreases monotonically
along flows and is stationary only at fixed points - where it `counts degrees

with respect to the Weyl group of $F_4$ root system and can be obtained by
averaging over an orbit of the Weyl group. Alternative way of finding these
variables exploiting a property of duality of the $F_4$ model is presented. It
is demonstrated that in these variables the Hamiltonian of each model can be
expressed as a quadratic polynomial in the generators of some
infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of differential operators in a
finite-dimensional representation. Both Hamiltonians preserve the same flag of
polynomials and each subspace of the flag coincides with the finite-dimensional
representation space of this algebra. Quasi-exactly-solvable generalization of
the rational $F_4$ model depending on two continuous and one discrete
parameters is found.

contributions are calculated by dispersion theory thus conserving the
analyticity of momentum distributions. The transport theoretical spectral

superconductors under non equilibrium conditions has stimulated an experimental
research in which the operating parameters of the experiment have been pushed
to values higher than those employed in previous attempts. The results confirm
the existence of an unexpected physical interaction. An apparatus has been
constructed and tested in which the superconductor is subjected to peak
currents in excess of 10^4 A, surface potentials in excess of 1 MV, trapped
magnetic field up to 1 T, and temperature down to 40 K. In order to produce the
required currents a high voltage discharge technique has been employed.
Discharges originating from a superconducting ceramic electrode are accompanied
by the emission of radiation which propagates in a focused beam without
noticeable attenuation through different materials and exerts a short repulsive
force on small movable objects along the propagation axis. Within the
measurement error (5 to 7 %) the impulse is proportional to the mass of the
objects and independent on their composition. It therefore resembles a
gravitational impulse. The observed phenomenon appears to be absolutely new and
unprecedented in the literature. It cannot be understood in the framework of
general relativity. A theory is proposed which combines a quantum gravity
approach with anomalous vacuum fluctuations.
