dwarf galaxy LGS 3 from deep Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 observations. LGS 3
is intriguing because ground-based observations showed that, while its stellar
population is dominated by old, metal-poor stars, there is a handful of young,
blue stars. Also, the presence of HI gas makes this a possible ``transition
object'' between dwarf spheroidal and dwarf irregular galaxies. The HST data
are deep enough to detect the horizontal branch and young main sequence for the
first time. A new distance of D=620+/-20 kpc has been measured from the
positions of the TRGB, the red clump, and the horizontal branch. The mean
metallicity of the stars older than 8 Gyr is Fe/H = -1.5 +/- 0.3. The most
recent generation of stars has Fe/H ~ -1. For the first few Gyr the global star
formation rate was several times higher than the historical average and has
been fairly constant since then. However, we do see significant changes in
stellar populations and star formation history with radial position in the
galaxy. Most of the young stars are found in the central 63 pc (21''), where
the star formation rate has been relatively constant, while the outer parts
have had a declining star formation rate.

has $N/\sqrt{p}$ particles, but the data are distributed in such a way that

much larger number of processors without losing efficiency compared to what was

elongates north-south with FWHM of 0.3 x 0.2 arcsec. Spectral energy
distribution (SED) of the central peak is fitted to have the silicate
absorption feature of tau_9.7um = 0.9 +/- 0.3. This is half of the absorption
expected from the near-infrared (NIR) feature of carbonaceous dust. This
suggests a temperature gradient of the absorbing dust along the line of sight.
Another possibility, which is not distinguishable here, is the size
distribution of dust different from our Galaxy. Intrinsic luminosity of
emission from the central peak is 3 x 10^37 W. The SED shows a hint of the poly
aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features. Although a high spatial
resolution MIR spectrum is required, it suggests that the PAH carriers near the
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are sheltered from the high-energy emission from
the AGNs and the AGNs have nuclear starbursts. For the NIR disklike structures,
no counterparts are detected in the MIR. The nature of the structures remains

the case of large telescopes, the technical validity has never been discussed

technique places the CCD in the image plane of the telescope. This does not
represent a problem in the case of small telescopes, where the practical
angular resolution attainable by LO is not limited by aperture smoothing.
Photon-generated charge is read out at millisecond rate on a column-per-column
basis, as the diffraction pattern of the occulted star is being tracked. Two LO
events (SAO 79031 and SAO 77911) were observed to demonstrate the feasibility
of the method. Data analysis was carried out and no angular diameter the
observed stars were resolved. We show, however, that the technique could be
useful for close binary detections with small telescopes. A discussion of the
limiting resolution and magnitude imposed by our instrumentation is carried
out, showing that drift-scanning technique could be extended to 1-2m telescopes
for stellar diameter determination purposes. Finally, we point out that the
technical demands required by this technique can be easily met by most small
professional observatories and advanced amateurs.

(B-V)_0 = 0.47 +- 0.17. The color evolution of the OAs is negligible although
their brightness declines by several magnitudes during the considered time
interval. Such a strong concentration of the color indices also suggests that
the intrinsic reddening (inside their host galaxies) must be quite similar and
relatively small for all these events. The absolute brightness of OAs in the
observer frame, corrected for the host galaxy, lies within M_(R_0) = -26.5 to
-22.2 for (t-T_0)_rest = 0.25 days. This spread of M_(R_0) is not significantly
influenced by the shifts of lambda, caused by the different redshift z of the
respective OAs. The general decline rate of the OA sample considered here seems
to be independent of the absolute optical brightness of the OA, measured at
some t-T_0 identical for all OAs, and the light curves of all events are almost
parallel, when corrected for the redshift-induced time dilation.

neuronal processing units leads naturally to a population representation of
information. We show how a time-dependent probability density, residing in a
specified function space of dimension D, may be decoded from the neuronal
activities in a population as a linear combination of certain decoding
functions, with coefficients given by the N firing rates (generally with D <<
N). We show how the neuronal encoding process may be described by projecting a
set of complementary encoding functions on the probability density, and passing
the result through a rectifying nonlinear activation function. We show how both
encoders and decoders may be determined by minimizing cost functions that
quantify the inaccuracy of the representation. Expressing a given computation
in terms of manipulation and transformation of probabilities, we show how this
representation leads to a neural circuit that can carry out the required
computation within a consistent Bayesian framework, with the synaptic weights
being explicitly generated in terms of encoders, decoders, conditional
probabilities, and priors.

particular, we focus on how the addition of a hydrogen atom affects the ground
state geometry, total energy and the first excited electronic level gap of an
Si$_{n}$ cluster. We discuss the nature of bonding of hydrogen in these
clusters. We find that hydrogen bonds with two silicon atoms only in Si$_{2}$H,
Si$_{3}$H and Si$_{5}$H clusters, while in other clusters (i.e. Si$_{4}$H,
Si$_{6}$H, Si$_{7}$H, Si$_{8}$H, Si$_{9}$H and Si$_{10}$H) hydrogen is bonded
to only one silicon atom. Also in the case of a compact and closed silicon
cluster hydrogen bonds to the cluster from outside. We find that the first
excited electronic level gap of Si$_{n}$ and Si$_{n}$H fluctuates as a function
of size and this may provide a first principles basis for the short-range
potential fluctuations in hydrogenated amorphous silicon. Our results show that
the addition of a single hydrogen can cause large changes in the electronic
structure of a silicon cluster, though the geometry is not much affected. Our
calculation of the lowest energy fragmentation products of Si$_{n}$H clusters
shows that hydrogen is easily removed from Si$_{n}$H clusters.

Beyond one loop, only universal (angular independent) corrections are known to
all orders except for massless $e^+ e^- \longrightarrow f {\overline f}$
processes where also angular dependent corrections exist in the literature. In
this paper we present general arguments for the consistent resummation of
angular dependent subleading (SL) logarithmic corrections to all orders in the
regime where all invariants are still large compared to the gauge boson masses.
We discuss soft isospin correlations, fermion mass and gauge boson mass gap
effects, the longitudinal and Higgs boson sector as well as mixing
contributions including CKM effects for massive quarks. Two loop arguments are
interpreted in the context of the effective high energy effective theory based
on the Standard Model Lagrangian in the symmetric basis with the appropriate
matching conditions to include the soft QED regime. The result is expressed in
exponentiated operator form in a CKM-extended isospin space in the symmetric
basis. Thus, a full electroweak SL treatment based on the infrared evolution
equation method is formulated for arbitrary high energy processes at future

curvature, we prove that these functionals have a uniform lower bound, via the
effective use of Tian's inequality. Consequently, we prove the following
theorem: Let $M$ be a K\""ahler-Einstein manifold with positive scalar
curvature. If the initial metric has nonnegative bisectional curvature and
positive at least at one point, then the K\""ahler Ricci flow will converge
exponentially fast to a K\""ahler-Einstein metric with constant bisectional
curvature. Such a result holds for K\""ahler-Einstein orbifolds.

pattern formation in semiconductors. Under galvanostatic control both systems
are unstable with respect to the formation of stationary large amplitude
current domains. The current domains as well as the homogeneous steady state
exhibit oscillatory instabilities for slow dynamics of the potential drop
across the double layer, or across the semiconductor device, respectively. The
interplay of the different instabilities leads to complex spatio-temporal
