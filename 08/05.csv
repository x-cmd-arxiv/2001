that GSH 305+01-24 most likely formed from stellar winds in the Centaurus OB1
stellar association. There is associated radio, infrared and H-alpha continuum
emission. Both shells are situated in the Sagittarius-Carina arm, with GSH

rotating, non-magnetic neutron star in an LMXB during a type I X-ray burst. Our
analysis takes into account the rapid rotation of the star and the lift-up of
the burning ocean during the burst. We find a new regime for spreading of a
nuclear burning front, where the flame is carried along a coherent shear flow
across the front. If turbulent viscosity is weak, the speed of flame
propagation is ~20 km/s, while, if turbulent viscosity is dynamically
important, the flame speed increases, and reaches the maximum value, ~300 km/s,
when the eddy overturn frequency is comparable to the Coriolis parameter. We
show that, due to rotationally reduced gravity, the thermonuclear runaway is
likely to begin on the equator. The equatorial belt is ignited first, and the
flame then propagates from the equator to the poles. Inhomogeneous cooling
(equator first, poles second) drives strong zonal currents which may be
unstable to formation of Jupiter-type vortices; we conjecture that these
vortices are responsible for modulation of X-ray flux in the tails of some
bursts. We consider the effect of strong zonal currents on the frequency of
modulation of the X-ray flux and show that the large values of the frequency
drifts observed in some bursts can be accounted for within our model combined
with the model of homogeneous radial expansion. Also, if inhomogeneities are
trapped in the forward zonal flows around the propagating burning front, chirps
with large frequency ranges (~25-500 Hz) may be detectable during the burst
rise. We argue that an MHD dynamo within the burning front can generate a
small-scale magnetic field, which may enforce vertically rigid flow in the
front's wake and can explain the coherence of oscillations in the burst tail.

Extended emission dominated by cold dust is detected up to 15 arcmin (~ 10 kpc)

probably related to large-scale outflows of gas (superwinds) which originate in

currently accessible experimental $p_{T}$ window and the non-abelian energy
loss of fast partons propagating through hot and dense medium. The recently
introduced two component hybrid model, which combines a quenched jet PQCD

""soft"" part, is further elaborated to take into account the full 3D expansion

field is considered from the quantum field theory point of view. The fermionic
determinant is computed using a general procedure that contains all possible
regularizations. The nonrelativistic grand-potential can be expressed in terms
polylogarithm functions, whereas the partition function in 2+1 dimensions and
vanishing chemical potential can be compactly written in terms of the Dedekind
eta function. The strong and weak magnetic fields limits are easily studied in
the latter case by using the duality properties of the Dedekind function.

"math/0108031","Leonardo Zapponi","Leonardo Zapponi","Galois Action on Diameter Four Trees","27 pages, 3 figures",,,,"math.AG math.NT",,"  The object of this paper is the study of a class of dessins d'enfants, the
so-called diameter four trees. These objects, first introduced by G. Shabat,
can be considered as the simplest non trivial example of etale covers of the
projective line minus three points. Their arithmetic properties are still
mysterious, and their study can inspire the understanding of more general
situations. Here, the main interest is devoted to the action of the absolute
Galois group on these (isomorphism classes of) coverings. In particular, in
many cases, we are able to distinguish Galois orbits and to describe the action
of the decomposition groups. One other central result concerns the study of
wild ramification, for which we show how to reduce to the tame case, and then
deduce some detailed arithmetical informations.

integrable evolution equations are considered. It has been previously observed
that the symmetries of the integrable evolution equations obtained through
their recursion operators do not satisfy the symmetry equations. There have
been several attempts to resolve this problem. It is shown that in the case of
time dependent evolution equations or time dependent recursion operators,
associativity is lost. Due to this fact such recursion operators need
modifications. A general formula is given for the missing term of the recursion
operators. Apart from the recursion operators a method is introduced to
calculate the correct symmetries. For illustrations several examples of scalar
and coupled system of equations are considered.

  Physical Review E, in press",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.64.046304",,"nlin.PS nlin.CD",,"  A model consisting of a mixed Kuramoto - Sivashinsky - KdV equation, linearly
coupled to an extra linear dissipative equation, is proposed. The model applies
to the description of surface waves on multilayered liquid films. The extra
equation makes its possible to stabilize the zero solution in the model,
opening way to the existence of stable solitary pulses (SPs). Treating the
dissipation and instability-generating gain in the model as small
perturbations, we demonstrate that balance between them selects two
steady-state solitons from their continuous family existing in the absence of
the dissipation and gain. The may be stable, provided that the zero solution is
stable. The prediction is completely confirmed by direct simulations. If the
integration domain is not very large, some pulses are stable even when the zero
background is unstable. Stable bound states of two and three pulses are found
too. The work was supported, in a part, by a joint grant from the Israeli
Minsitry of Science and Technology and Japan Society for Promotion of Science.
