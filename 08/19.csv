  tables, 10 figures",,"10.1086/339317",,"astro-ph",,"  The source population of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) declines towards the present
epoch being consistent with the measured decline of the star formation rate. We
show this using the brightness distribution of 3255 long BATSE GRBs found in an
off-line scan of the BATSE continuous 1.024 s count rate records. The
significance of this conclusion is enhanced by the detection of three GRBs with
known redshifts brighter than 10^{52} erg/s during the last two years. This is
an argument in favor of the generally believed idea that GRBs are strongly
correlated with the star production, at least on cosmological time scales, and
favors the association of long GRBs with collapses of supermassive stars.
However, we still cannot rule out neutron star mergers if the typical delay
time for binary system evolution is relatively short. If we assume a steep
decline of the GRB population at z>1.5, then their luminosity function can be
clearly outlined. The luminosity function is close to a power law, dN/dL ~
L^{-1.4}, for low luminosities over at least 1.7 orders of magnitude. Then the
luminosity function breaks to a steeper slope or to an exponential decline
around L = 3*10^{51} erg/s in the 50-300 keV range assuming isotropic emission.

Starting from cosmological initial conditions we follow the evolution of

field. CRIs and primary CREs are injected and accelerated at large scale
structure shocks. Secondary CREs are continuously generated through inelastic
p-p collisions. We include spatial transport, adiabatic expansion/compression,
Coulomb collisions, bremsstrahlung, synchrotron (SE)and inverse Compton (IC)
emission. We find that, from the perspective of cosmic shock energy and
acceleration efficiency, the few detections of hard X-ray radiation excess
could be explained in the framework of IC emission of primary CREs in clusters
undergoing high accretion/merger phase. Instead, IC emission from both primary
and secondary CREs accounts at most for a small fraction of the radiation
excesses detected in the extreme-UV (except for the Coma cluster as reported by
Bowyer et al.1999). Next, we calculate the SE after normalizing the magnetic
field so that for a Coma-like cluster <B^2>^1/2~3 \muG. Our results indicate
that the SE from secondary CREs reproduces several general properties of radio
halos, including the recently found P_1.4GHz vs T relation, the morphology and
polarization of the emitting region and, to some extent, the spectral index.
Moreover, SE from primary CREs turns out sufficient to power extended regions
resembling radio relics observed at the outskirts of clusters. Again we find
striking resemblance between morphology, polarization and spectral index of our
synthetic maps and those reported in the literature.

are completely specified by two Tomonaga-Luttinger parameters $K_{\rho}$ and
$v_{\sigma}$. In this paper we discuss microscopic estimates of the values of
these parameters in semiconductor quantum wires that exploit their relationship
to thermodynamic properties. Motivated by the recognized similarity between
correlations in the ground state of a one-dimensional electron liquid and
correlations in a Wigner crystal, we evaluate these thermodynamic quantities in
a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. According to our calculations,
the Hartree-Fock approximation ground state is a Wigner crystal at all electron
densities and has antiferromagnetic order that gradually evolves from
spin-density-wave to localized in character as the density is lowered. Our
results for $K_{\rho}$ are in good agreement with weak-coupling perturbative
estimates $K_{\rho}^{pert}$ at high densities, but deviate strongly at low
densities, especially when the electron-electron interaction is screened at
long distances. $K_{\rho}^{pert}\sim n^{1/2}$ vanishes at small carrier density
$n$ whereas we conjecture that $K_{\rho}\to 1/2$ when $n\to 0$, implying that
$K_{\rho}$ should pass through a minimum at an intermediate density.
Observation of such a non-monotonic dependence on particle density would allow
to measure the range of the microscopic interaction. In the spin sector we find
that the spin velocity decreases with increasing interaction strength or
decreasing $n$. Strong correlation effects make it difficult to obtain fully
consistent estimates of $v_{\sigma}$ from Hartree-Fock calculations. We
conjecture that $v_{\sigma}/\vf\propto n/V_0$ in the limit $n\to 0$ where $V_0$
is the interaction strength.

prevalence of magnetism in the normal state and the persistence of

and magnetism are not compatible. But recent neutron scattering results
indicate that antiferromagnetism can appear deep in the superconducting state
in an applied magnetic field. Magnetic fields penetrate a superconductor in the
form of quantized flux lines each one representing a vortex of supercurrents.
Superconductivity is suppressed in the core of the vortex and it has been
suggested that antiferromagnetism might develop there. To address this question
it is important to perform electronic structural studies with spatial
resolution. Here we report on implementation of a high field NMR imaging
experiment that allows spatial resolution of the electronic behavior both
inside and outside the vortex cores. Outside we find strong antiferromagnetic
fluctuations, and localized inside there are electronic states rather different
from those found in conventional superconductors.

for the twisted sectors of heterotic orbifolds. In [1] we explained how in M
theory the twisted states couple to gauge fields apparently living on M9 branes

involves 7D gauge fields which live on fixed planes of the (T^4/Z_N) x
(S^1/Z_2) x R^{5,1} orbifold and lock onto the 10D gauge fields along the
intersection planes. The physics of such intersection planes does not follow
directly from the M theory but there are stringent kinematic constraints due to
duality and local consistency, which allowed us to deduce the local fields and
the boundary conditions at each intersection. In this paper we explain various
phenomena at the intersection planes in terms of duality between HW and type I'
superstring theories. The orbifold fixed planes are dual to stacks of D6
branes, the M9 planes are dual to O8 orientifold planes accompanied by D8
branes, and the intersections are dual to brane junctions. We engineer several
junction types which lead to distinct patterns of 7D/10D gauge field locking,
7D symmetry breaking and/or local 6D fields. Another aspect of brane
engineering is putting the junctions together; sometimes, the combined effect
is rather spectacular from the HW point of view and the quantum numbers of some
twisted states have to `bounce' off both ends of the eleventh dimension before
their heterotic identity becomes clear. Some models involve D6/O8 junctions
where the string coupling diverges towards the orientifold plane. We use the
heterotic-HW-I' duality to predict what should happen at such junctions.

"math/0108127","Gregory J. Chaitin","G. J. Chaitin (IBM Research)","Paradoxes of Randomness",,,,,"math.HO math.LO",,"  I'll discuss how Goedel's paradox ""This statement is false/unprovable"" yields
his famous result on the limits of axiomatic reasoning. I'll contrast that with
my work, which is based on the paradox of ""The first uninteresting positive
whole number"", which is itself a rather interesting number, since it is
precisely the first uninteresting number. This leads to my first result on the
limits of axiomatic reasoning, namely that most numbers are uninteresting or
random, but we can never be sure, we can never prove it, in individual cases.
And these ideas culminate in my discovery that some mathematical facts are true
for no reason, they are true by accident, or at random. In other words, God not
only plays dice in physics, but even in pure mathematics, in logic, in the
world of pure reason. Sometimes mathematical truth is completely random and has
no structure or pattern that we will ever be able to understand. It is NOT the
case that simple clear questions have simple clear answers, not even in the
world of pure ideas, and much less so in the messy real world of everyday life.

"physics/0108036","Jan M. L. Martin","Srinivasan Parthiban, Jan M.L. Martin, and Joel F. Liebman","The heats of formation of the haloacetylenes XCCY [X, Y = H, F, Cl]:
  basis set limit ab initio results and thermochemical analysis","Mol. Phys., in press (E. R. Davidson issue)",,"10.1080/00268970110082015",,"physics.chem-ph physics.ao-ph",,"  The heats of formation of haloacetylenes are evaluated using the recent W1
and W2 ab initio computational thermochemistry methods. These calculations
involve CCSD and CCSD(T) coupled cluster methods, basis sets of up to spdfgh
quality, extrapolations to the one-particle basis set limit, and contributions
of inner-shell correlation, scalar relativistic effects, and (where relevant)
first-order spin-orbit coupling. The heats of formation determined using W2
theory are: \hof(HCCH) = 54.48 kcal/mol, \hof(HCCF) = 25.15 kcal/mol,
\hof(FCCF) = 1.38 kcal/mol, \hof(HCCCl) = 54.83 kcal/mol, \hof(ClCCCl) = 56.21
kcal/mol, and \hof(FCCCl) = 28.47 kcal/mol. Enthalpies of hydrogenation and
destabilization energies relative to acetylene were obtained at the W1 level of
theory. So doing we find the following destabilization order for acetylenes:
FCCF $>$ ClCCF $>$ HCCF $>$ ClCCCl $>$ HCCCl $>$ HCCH. By a combination of W1
theory and isodesmic reactions, we show that the generally accepted heat of
formation of 1,2-dichloroethane should be revised to -31.8$\pm$0.6 kcal/mol, in
excellent agreement with a very recent critically evaluated review. The
performance of compound thermochemistry schemes such as G2, G3, G3X and CBS-QB3
theories has been analyzed.
