spectrum which is incompatible with the assumption that the cosmic ray spectra
measured locally hold throughout the Galaxy: the spectrum above 1 GeV, where
the emission is supposedly dominated by pi^0-decay, is harder than that derived
from the local cosmic ray proton spectrum.
  We demonstrate that in case of a SNR origin of cosmic ray nucleons part of
this gamma-ray excess may be attributed to the dispersion of the spectral
indices in these objects. In global averages, as are gamma-ray line-of-sight
integrals, this dispersion leads to a positive curvature in the composite
spectrum, and hence to modified pi^0-decay gamma-ray spectra.

a spread of transfer rates in systems with similar orbital period. The effect
is maximal if the specific angular momentum in the shell is the same as the
specific orbital angular momentum of the white dwarf. We show analytically that
in this case the nova-induced widening of the mass transfer rate distribution
can be significant if the system, in the absence of nova outbursts, is close to
mass transfer instability (i.e., within a factor of ~1.5 of the critical mass
ratio). Hence the effect is negligible below the period gap and for systems
with high-mass white dwarfs. At orbital periods between about 3 and 6 hrs the
width of the mass transfer rate distribution exceeds an order of magnitude if
the mass accreted on the white dwarf prior to the runaway is larger than a few
10^{-4} M_sun. At a given orbital period in this range, systems with the
highest transfer rate should on average have the largest ratio of donor to
white dwarf mass. We show results of population synthesis models which confirm
and augment the analytic results.

gravitational systems is examined, both in the case of the full $N$-body
problem and that of trajectories moving in the gravitational field of
non-interacting background particles. In the latter case, for $N \ge 10000$,
some trajectories, even if unstable, had exceedingly long diffusion times,
which correlated with the characteristic e-folding timescale of the
instability. For trajectories of $N \approx 100000$ systems this timescale
could be arbitrarily large --- and thus appear to correspond to regular orbits.
For centrally concentrated systems, low angular momentum trajectories were
found to be systematically more unstable. This phenomenon is analogous to the
well known case of trajectories in generic centrally concentrated non-spherical
smooth systems, where eccentric trajectories are found to be chaotic. The
exponentiation times also correlate with the conservation of the angular
momenta along the trajectories. For $N$ up to a few hundred, the instability
timescales of $N$-body systems and their variation with particle number are
similar to those of the most chaotic trajectories in inhomogeneous
non-interacting systems. For larger $N$ (up to a few thousand) the values of
the these timescales were found to saturate, increasing significantly more
slowly with $N$. We attribute this to collective effects in the fully
self-gravitating problem, which are apparent in the time-variations of the time
dependent Liapunov exponents. The results presented here go some way towards
resolving the long standing apparent paradoxes concerning the local instability
of trajectories of gravitational systems (abridged).

giant stars by far most of the nonradial modes are confined to to the deep
interior, where they have the g-mode character. Only modes at resonant
frequencies of the p-mode cavity have substantial amplitudes in the outer
layers. We have shown that such modes can be unstable with the linear growth
rates similar to those of corresponding to radial modes.
  We have been unable to explain the observed oscillation properties of alpha
UMa, either in terms of mode instability or in terms of stochastic excitation
by turbulent convection. Modes at the lowest frequencies, which exhibit the
largest amplitudes and may correspond to the first three radial modes, are
found stable if all effects of convection are taken into account. The observed
frequency dependence of amplitudes does not agree with what one expects from
stochastic excitation. The predicted fundamental mode amplitude is by about two
orders of magnitude smaller than those of high frequency modes, which is in

one-dimensional attractive Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian is investigated in
connection with directed polymers in random media. The excitation gap \Delta is
obtained by exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the two- and
three-particle sectors and also by an exact Bethe Ansatz solution in the
two-particle sector. The dynamic exponent z is found to be 2. However, in the
intermediate range of the size L where UL~O(1), U being the attractive
interaction, the effective dynamic exponent shows an anomalous peak reaching
high values of 2.4 and 2.7 for the two- and the three-particle sectors,
respectively. The anomalous behavior is related to a change in the sign of the
first excited-state energy. In the two-particle sector, we use the Bethe Ansatz
solution to obtain the effective dynamic exponent as a function of the scaling
variable UL/\pi. The continuum version, the attractive delta-function Bose-gas
Hamiltonian, is integrable by the Bethe Ansatz with suitable quantum numbers,
the distributions of which are not known in general. Quantum numbers are
proposed for the first excited state and are confirmed numerically for an
arbitrary number of particles.

them on the insulating side of the superconductor-insulator transition, the

which reduce the transition temperature and ultimately quench
superconductivity, changed the sign of the reponse of the conductance to

films with rectangular arrays of magnetic dots. In this type of pinning
geometry, a change in the periodicity and shape of the minima in the
magnetoresistance occurs for magnetic fields exceeding a certain threshold
value. This has been explained recently in terms of a reconfiguration
transition of the vortex lattice due to an increasing vortex-vortex interaction
with increasing magnetic field. In this picture the dominating elastic energy
at high fields forces the vortex lattice to form a square symmetry rather than
being commensurate to the rectangular geometry of the pinning array. In this
paper we present a comparative study of rectangular arrays with Ni-dots,
Co-dots and holes. In the magnetic dot arrays, we found a strong fractional
matching effect up to the second order matching field. In contrast, no clear
fractional matching is seen after the reconfiguration. Additionally, we
discovered the existence of hysteresis in the magnetoresistance in the
crossover between the low and the high field regime. We found evidence that
this effect is correlated to the reconfiguration phenomenon rather than to the
magnetic state of the dots. The temperature and angular dependences of the
effect have been measured and possible models are discussed to explain this
behavior.

indication that the transition is first order. This transition has been
theoretically studied since the early sixties, mostly within an approach in
which the microscopic configurations of a DNA molecule are given by an
alternating sequence of non-interacting bound segments and denaturated loops.
Studies of these models neglect the repulsive, self-avoiding, interaction
between different loops and segments and have invariably yielded continuous
denaturation transitions. In this study we exploit recent results on scaling
properties of polymer networks of arbitrary topology in order to take into
account the excluded-volume interaction between denaturated loops and the rest
of the chain. We thus obtain a first-order phase transition in d=2 dimensions
and above, in agreement with experiments. We also consider within our approach
the unzipping transition, which takes place when the two DNA strands are pulled
apart by an external force acting on one end. We find that the unzipping
transition is also first order. Although the denaturation and unzipping
transitions are thermodynamically first order, they do exhibit critical
fluctuations in some of their properties. For instance, the loop size
distribution decays algebraically at the transition and the length of the
denaturated end segment diverges as the transition is approached. We evaluate
these critical properties within our approach.

and has been tested in various condensed matter experiments. However, from the
viewpoint of particle physics and cosmology, gauge field theories are more
relevant than global theories. In recent years, there have been significant
advances in the theory of defect formation in gauge field theories, which make
precise predictions possible, and in experimental techniques that can be used
to test these predictions in superconductor experiments. This opens up the
possibility of carrying out relatively simple and controlled experiments, in
which the non-equilibrium phase transition dynamics of gauge field theories can
be studied. This will have a significant impact on our understanding of phase
transitions in the early universe and in heavy ion collider experiments. In
this paper, I review the current status of the theory and the experiments in
which it can be tested.

$S^1/(Z_2\times Z_2')$ orbifold GUT models allow an appealing explanation of
the observed hierarchical structure of the quark and lepton masses and mixing
angles. Flavor hierarchies arise from the geometrical suppression of some
couplings when fields propagate in different numbers of dimensions, or on
different fixed branes. Restrictions arising from locality in the extra
dimension allow interesting texture zeroes to be easily generated. In addition
the detailed nature of the SU(5)-breaking orbifold projections lead to simple
theories where $b-\tau$ unification is maintained but similar disfavored SU(5)
relations for the lighter generations are naturally avoided. We find that
simple 5d models based on $S^1/(Z_2\times Z_2')$ are strikingly successful in
explaining many features of the masses and mixing angles of the 2nd and 3rd
generation. Successful three generation models of flavor including neutrinos
are constructed by generalizing the $S^1/(Z_2\times Z'_2)$ model to six
dimensions. Large angle neutrino mixing is elegantly accommodated. Novel
features of these models include a simple $m_u=0$ configuration leading to a
solution of the strong CP problem.

one-parameter unitary group W(\theta) in L^2(R) which rotates the
time-frequency plane. In particular, W(\pi/2) is the Fourier transform. When
W(\theta) is applied to any frame of Gabor wavelets, the result is another such
frame with identical frame bounds. Thus each Gabor frame gives rise to a
one-parameter family of frames, which we call a deformation of the original.
For example, beginning with the usual tight frame F of Gabor wavelets generated
by a compactly supported window g(t) and parameterized by a regular lattice in
the time-frequency plane, one obtains a family of frames F_\theta generated by
the non-compactly supported windows g_\theta=W(theta)g, parameterized by
rotated versions of the original lattice. This gives a method for constructing
tight frames of Gabor wavelets for which neither the window nor its Fourier
transform have compact support. When \theta=\pi/2, we obtain the well-known
Gabor frame generated by a window with compactly supported Fourier transform.
The family F_\theta therefore interpolates these two familiar examples.

scalar wavelets with vector coefficients developed earlier is generalized to
wavelets with polarization, which are matrix-valued. The construction proceeds
in four stages: (1) A Hilbert space H of solutions is considered, based on a
conformally invariant inner product. (2) The analytic-signal transform extends
solutions from real space-time to a complex space-time domain T (double tube).
The evaluation map E_z, which sends any solution F=B+iE in H to the value F(z)
at z\in T, is bounded. The electromagnetic wavelets are defined as the adjoints
the \Psi_z=E_z^*. (3) The eight real parameters z=x+iy\in T are given a
complete physical interpretation: x\in R^4 is interpreted as a space-time point
about which \Psi_z is focussed, and the timelike vector y gives its scale and
velocity. Thus wavelets parameterized by the set of {\sl Euclidean} points
(real space, imaginary time) have stationary centers, and the others are
Doppler-shifted versions of the former. All the wavelets can be obtained from a
single ""mother wavelet"" by conformal transformations. (4) A resolution of unity
is established in H, giving a representation of solutions as ""atomic
compositions"" of wavelets parameterized by z\in E. This yields a constructive
method for generating solutions with initial data specified locally in space
and by scale. Other representations, employing wavelets with moving centers,
are obtained by applying conformal transformations to the stationary
representation. This could be useful in the analysis of electromagnetic waves
reflected or emitted by moving objects, such as radar signals.

controversial even though it is perhaps the best-documented sequence modulation

is distinguished by the large static curvature and characteristic bending
dynamics, suggesting that the computed effect corresponds to the experimental
phenomenon. The results poorly agree with earlier views that attributed a
decisive role in DNA bending to sequence specific base pair stacking or binding
of solvent counterions, but lend additional support to the hypothesis of a
compressed frustrated state of the backbone as the principal physical cause of
the static curvature. We discuss the possible ways of experimental verification
