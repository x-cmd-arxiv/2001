Grating Spectrometer. Many emission lines of highly ionized elements are
detected with the relativistic blue and red Doppler shifts. The lines are
measurably broadened to 1700 km/s (FWHM) and the widths do not depend
significantly on the characteristic emission temperature, suggesting that the
emission occurs in a freely expanding region of constant collimation with
opening angle of 1.23 +/- 0.06 deg. The blue shifts of lines from low
temperature gas are the same as those of high temperature gas within our
uncertainties, again indicating that the hottest gas we observe to emit
emission lines is already at terminal velocity. Fits to the emission line
fluxes give a range of temperatures in the jet from 5e6 to 1e8 K. We derive the
emission measure as a function of temperature for a four component model that
fits the line flux data. Using the density sensitive Si XIII triplet, the
characteristic electron density is 1e14 cm^{-3}, where the gas temperature is
about 1.3e7 K. Based on an adiabatic expansion model of the jet, the electron
densities drop from ~2e15 to 4e13 cm^{-3} at distances of 2e10 to 2e11 cm from
the apex of the jet cone. The jet mass outflow rate is 1.5e-7 Msun / yr. The
kinetic power is 3.2e38 erg/s, which is x1000 larger than the unabsorbed 2-10
keV X-ray luminosity. The bremsstrahlung emission associated with the lines can
account for the entire continuum; we see no direct evidence for an accretion
disk. The image from zeroth order shows extended emission at a scale of ~2"",
aligned in the general direction of the radio jets.

photoionizing background due to stars and quasars. We use this model to predict
the thermodynamic history of the IGM when photoionized by galaxies forming in a
cold dark matter (CDM) universe. The evolution of the galaxies is calculated
using a semi-analytical model, including a detailed treatment of the effects of
tidal stripping and dynamical friction on satellite galaxies orbiting inside
larger dark matter halos. We include in the model the negative feedback on
galaxy formation from the photoionizing background. Photoionization inhibits
galaxy formation in low-mass dark matter halos in two ways: (i) heating of the
IGM and inhibition of the collapse of gas into dark halos by the IGM pressure,
and (ii) reduction in the radiative cooling of gas within halos. The result of
our method is a self-consistent model of galaxy formation and the IGM. The IGM
is reheated twice (during reionization of HI and HeII), and we find that the
star formation rate per unit volume is slightly suppressed after each episode
of reheating. We find that galaxies brighter than L_* are mostly unaffected by
reionization, while the abundance of faint galaxies is significantly reduced,
leading to present-day galaxy luminosity functions with shallow faint end
slopes, in good agreement with recent observational data. Reionization also
affects other properties of these faint galaxies, in a readily understandable
way.

that surviving satellites are preferentially those that formed before the

about an order of magnitude smaller than the number inferred by identifying
satellites with subhalos in high-resolution simulations of the dark matter. The
resulting satellite population has an abundance and a distribution of circular

properties of satellite galaxies, including their gas content, metallicity and
star formation rate, and find generally good agreement with available data. Our
model predicts the existence of many as yet undetected satellites in the Local

surface brightness and also in terms of their constituent stars. A
near-complete census of the Milky Way's satellites would require imaging to
V~20 and to a surface brightness fainter than 26 V-band magnitudes per square

100 stars brighter than B=26, with central stellar densities of a few tens per

(40% of the expected HI for the LBs and morphological types of the member

groups globally, DefHI = 0.62 (24% of the expected HI), due in most cases to
efficient gas stripping from individual galaxies into the group environment
visible in the VLA maps. The degree of deficiency is found to be similar to the
central galaxies of Virgo and Coma cluster, and Coma I group, in spite of the
significantly different characteristics of these environments. Phase
transformation of the HI should explain the deficiency. The detection rate of
HCGs at X-ray wavelengths is larger for HI deficient groups. In the
evolutionary scenario we propose, the amount of detected HI would decrease
further with evolution, by continuous tidal stripping and/or heating. The H2
content also tends to be lower than expected for the galaxies in HI deficient

breaks the balance between the disruption of molecular clouds by star formation

magnification ratio of a typical image pair will deviate significantly from the
value predicted by a smooth lensing potential if, near the Einstein radius,
only a few percent of the lens surface density is contained in subhalos. The
angular size of the continuum source dictates the range of subclump masses that
can have a detectable effect: to avoid confusion with gravitational
microlensing caused by stars in the lens galaxy, the background source must be
larger than the optical continuum-emitting region of a QSO. We also find that
substructure will cause distortions to images on milli-arcsecond scales and
bias the distribution of QSO magnification ratios -- two other possible methods

global profile widths W_{R,I}^i, the HI RCs allow direct measurements of the
maximum rotation Vmax and the amplitudes Vflat of the outer flat parts. The
dynamical state of the gas disks could also be determined in detail. For large
galaxy samples, the M^{b,i}_R - Log(W_{R,I}^i) correlation in conjunction with
strict selection criteria is preferred for distance determinations with a 7%
accuracy. Galaxies with rising RCs at the last measured point lie
systematically on the low velocity side of the TF-relation. Galaxies with
partly declining RCs (Vmax>Vflat) tend to lie on the high velocity side when
using W_{R,I}^i or Vmax. These trends are eliminated when Vflat is used. The
M^{b,i}_B - Log(2Vflat) residuals correlate consistently with morphology,
color, surface brightness and gas mass fraction. These correlations are absent
for the near-IR M^{b,i}_K' - Log(2Vflat) residuals. The tightest correlation
(Xred=1.1) is found for the M^{b,i}_K' - Log(2Vflat) relation with a slope of
-11.3 +/- 0.5 and a total scatter of 0.26^m with a most likely intrinsic
scatter of zero. The tightness of the near-IR correlation is preserved when
converting it into a baryonic TF-relation which has a slope of -10.0 for
(Mgas/L_K')=1.6 while a zero intrinsic scatter remains most likely. The
tightness of the near-IR and baryonic correlations suggests that the
TF-relation reflects a correlation between the dark matter halo mass, indicated
by Vflat, and the total baryonic mass Mbar where Mbar~Vflat^4. The distribution
of the baryons inside halos of similar mass is irrelevant for this relation.

  sets","Submitted to ApJ; 30 pages, 7 figures, uses AASTeX v5.0",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present a neural net algorithm for parameter estimation in the context of
large cosmological data sets. Cosmological data sets present a particular
challenge to pattern-recognition algorithms since the input patterns (galaxy
redshift surveys, maps of cosmic microwave background anisotropy) are not fixed
templates overlaid with random noise, but rather are random realizations whose
information content lies in the correlations between data points. We train a
``committee'' of neural nets to distinguish between Monte Carlo simulations at
fixed parameter values. Sampling the trained networks using additional Monte
Carlo simulations generated at intermediate parameter values allows accurate
interpolation to parameter values for which the networks were never trained.
The Monte Carlo samples automatically provide the probability distributions and
truth tables required for either a frequentist or Bayseian analysis of the one
observable sky. We demonstrate that neural networks provide unbiased parameter
estimation with comparable precision as maximum-likelihood algorithms but
significant computational savings. In the context of CMB anisotropies, the
computational cost for parameter estimation via neural networks scales as
$N^{3/2}$. The results are insensitive to the noise levels and sampling schemes
typical of large cosmological data sets and provide a desirable tool for the
new generation of large, complex data sets.

Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code to model the evolution of the system, and
take the neutron star to be a polytrope with a soft (adiabatic index G=2 and
G=5/3) equation of state and the black hole to be a Newtonian point mass. The
only non-Newtonian effect we include is a gravitational radiation back reaction
force, computed in the quadrupole approximation for point masses. We use
irrotational binaries as initial conditions for our dynamical simulations,
which are begun when the system is on the verge of initiating mass transfer and
followed for approximately 23 ms. For all the cases studied we find that the
star is disrupted on a dynamical time-scale, and forms a massive (the disc mass
is approximately 0.2 solar masses) accretion torus around the spinning (Kerr)
black hole. The rotation axis is clear of baryons (less than 1.e-5 solar masses
within 10 degrees) to an extent that would not preclude the formation of a
relativistic fireball capable of powering a cosmological gamma ray burst. Some
mass (the specific amount is sensitive to the stiffness of the equation of
state) may be dynamically ejected from the system during the coalescence and
could undergo r-process nucleosynthesis. We calculate the waveforms,
luminosities and energy spectra of the gravitational radiation signal and show

velocities show strong deviations from those expected for a pure Keplerian

nearest-neighbor flares. This analysis is based on the joint use of two
distinct techniques. The first is the direct evaluation of the distribution
function $\psi(\tau)$, or of the probability, $\Psi(tau)$, that no time
distance smaller than a given $\tau$ is found. We adopt the paradigm of the
inverse power law behavior, and we focus on the determination of the inverse
power index $\mu$, without ruling out different asymptotic properties that
might be revealed, at larger scales, with the help of richer statistics. The
second technique, called Diffusion Entropy (DE) method, rests on the evaluation
of the entropy of the diffusion process generated by the time series. The
details of the diffusion process depend on three different walking rules, which
determine the form and the time duration of the transition to the scaling
regime, as well as the scaling parameter $\delta$. With the first two rules the
information contained in the time series is transmitted, to a great extent, to
the transition, as well as to the scaling regime. The same information is
essentially conveyed, by using the third rules, into the scaling regime, which,
in fact, emerges very quickly after a fast transition process. We show that the
significant information hidden within the time series concerns memory induced
by the solar cycle, as well as the power index $\mu$. The scaling parameter
$\delta$ becomes a simple function of $\mu$, when memory is annihilated. Thus,
the three walking rules yield a unique and precise value of $\mu$ if the memory
is wisely taken under control, or cancelled by shuffling the data. All this
makes compelling the conclusion that $\mu = 2.138 \pm 0.01$.

scalar field is studied in the large N limit with the goal of comparing the
dynamics predicted from the renormalization group improved effective potential
to that obtained including the fermionic backreaction. The effective potential
is of the Coleman-Weinberg type. Its renormalization group improvement is
unbounded from below and features a Landau pole. When viewed self-consistently,
the initial time singularity does not arise. The different regimes of the
dynamics of the fully renormalized theory are studied both analytically and
numerically. Despite the existence of a Landau pole in the model, the dynamics
of the mean field is smooth as it passes the location of the pole. This is a
consequence of a remarkable cancellation between the effective potential and
the dynamical chiral condensate. The asymptotic evolution is effectively
described by a quartic upright effective potential. In all regimes, profuse
particle production results in the formation of a dense fermionic plasma with
occupation numbers nearly saturated up to a scale of the order of the mean
field. This can be interpreted as a chemical potential. We discuss the
implications of these results for cosmological preheating.

field, compute the expectation values of the vector and axial vector currents,
and recover the well known anomaly $e^2 E/\pi$ in the divergence of the latter.
A final intriguing result is that the theory seems to exhibit a phase
transition in the limit of infinite $L$.

electrodynamics through photon-photon scattering, in Maxwell's equation. The
photon-photon scattering gives rise to self-interaction terms, which are
similar to the nonlinearities due to the polarisation in nonlinear optics.
These self-interaction terms vanish in the limit of parallel propagating waves,
but if instead of parallel propagating waves the modes generated in wavesguides
are used, there will be a non-zero total effect. Based on this idea, we
calculate the nonlinear excitation of new modes and estimate the strength of
this effect. Furthermore, we suggest a principal experimental setup.

the presence of cryoprotectors: dimethyl sulfoxide and glycerol. Three types of
phospholipid membranes: DPPC, DMPC, DSPC are chosen for the investigation as
well-studied model biological membranes. A special cryostat is used for sample
cooling from 14.1C to -55.4C. The ice formation is only detected by WAXS in
binary phospholipid/water and ternary phospholipid/cryoprotector/water systems
in the condition of excess solvent. Ice formation in a binary
phospholipid/water system creates an abrupt decrease of the membrane repeat
distance by delta-d, so-called ice-induced dehydration of intermembrane space.
The value of delta-d decreases as the cryoprotector concentration increases.
The formation of ice does not influence the membrane structure (delta-d = 0)
for cryoprotector mole fractions higher than 0.05.

precision, or (ii) the collection of all 1-qudit gates together with V produces
all n-qudit gates exactly. We show that (i) and (ii) are equivalent conditions

polarization and in space. Here we show how the spatial entanglement can be

elements. Spatial entanglement as an additional resource leads to a substantial
improvement in entanglement output compared to a previous scheme.
Interestingly, in the present context the thermal character of down-conversion
sources can be turned into an advantage. Our scheme is realizable with current
technology.

parctically independent to the heating effects i.e., can perform logic
operations constantly without cooling the RDS crystal. Also, we have proposed
the quantum parallelsim i.e., parallel coherent laser beams are injected at the
input of the RDS crystals. By using the RDS crystal we can perform the reduce
the requirements of the linear and nonlinear optical components.

  discussion a bit","J. Math. Phys. 43(9):4341--4352, 2002.","10.1063/1.1498489",,"quant-ph",,"  We consider two apparently separated problems: in the first part of the paper
we study the concept of a scalable (approximate) programmable quantum gate
(SPQG). These are special (approximate) programmable quantum gates, with nice
properties that could have implications on the theory of universal computation.
Unfortunately, as we prove, such objects do not exist in the domain of usual
quantum theory. In the second part the problem of noisy dense coding (and
generalizations) is addressed. We observe that the additivity problem for the
classical capacity obtained is of apparently greater generality than for the
usual quantum channel (completely positive maps): i.e., the latter occurs as a
special case of the former, but, as we shall argue with the help of the
non-existence result of the first part, the former cannot be reduced to an
instance of the latter. We conclude by suggesting that the additivity problem
for the classical capacity of quantum channels, as posed until now, may
conceptually not be in its appropriate generality.

  Discussion of results added","Quant. Inf. Comp. 6, 433 (2002).",,,"quant-ph",,"  In this paper we present the computational model underlying the one-way
quantum computer which we introduced recently [Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 5188
(2001)]. The one-way quantum computer has the property that any quantum logic
network can be simulated on it. Conversely, not all ways of quantum information
processing that are possible with the one-way quantum computer can be
understood properly in network model terms. We show that the logical depth is,
for certain algorithms, lower than has so far been known for networks. For
example, every quantum circuit in the Clifford group can be performed on the
one-way quantum computer in a single step.
