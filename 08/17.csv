emission is found to be centered 4.3 +/- 1.3 arcsec east and 3.5(-0.6,+1.3)
arcsec north of image B, nearer than previous estimates. Its spectrum can be
modeled well with a thermal plasma model consistent with the emission
originating from a cluster at a redshift of 0.36. Our best-fit estimates of the
cluster temperature of T_e = 2.09(-0.54,+0.83) keV (90 percent confidence) and
mass distribution of the cluster are used to derive the convergence parameter
kappa, the ratio of the cluster surface mass density to the critical density
required for lensing. We estimate the convergence parameter at the location of
the lensed images A and B to be kappa_A = 0.22(+0.14,-0.07) and kappa_B =
0.21(+0.12,-0.07), respectively (90 percent confidence levels). The observed
cluster center, mass distribution and convergence parameter kappa provide
additional constraints to lens models of this system. Our new results break a
mass-sheet degeneracy in GL models of this system and provide better
constraints of ~ 29 percent (90 percent confidence levels) on the Hubble
constant. We also present results from the detection of the most distant X-ray
jet (z = 1.41) detected to date. The jet extends approximately 8 arcsec NE of
image A and three knots are resolved along the X-ray jet with flux densities
decreasing with distance from the core. The observed radio and optical flux
densities of the knots are fitted well with a synchrotron model and the X-ray
emission is modeled well with inverse Compton scattering of Cosmic Microwave
Background photons by synchrotron-emitting electrons in the jet.

briefly reviewed. Though still uncertain due to the small sample, the number of
O VI absorbers per unit redshift is quite high, and these absorbers appear to
trace an important baryon reservoir. The O VI systems are intervening; they are
highly displaced from the background QSO redshifts and are correlated with
foreground luminous galaxies. Their physical conditions are variable and
sometimes complicated. In some cases, there is clear evidence that the
absorbers have a multiphase nature. Some appear to be photoionized by the UV
background from QSOs, while others are probably collisionally ionized. However,
the majority of the O VI lines have b-values that suggest an origin in
collisionally ionized hot gas. The observations are in agreement with
hydrodynamic simulations of cosmological structure growth, which predict
substantial quantities of shock-heated, hot intergalactic gas at low z, but
more observational and theoretical work is needed to confirm the nature of the

on our clusters with those from the literature we parametrize the redshift

resolved more than 50% of the CIRB intensity, hence allowing to investigate the
origin of the CIRB. From our fits to the observed optical-IR SEDs, these
objects appear to involve massive galaxies hosting luminous starbursts (SFR 100
Mo/yr). Our evolutionary scheme considers a bimodal star formation (SF),
including long-lived quiescent SF, and enhanced SF taking place during
transient events recurrently triggered by interactions and merging. We
interpret the strong observed evolution as an increase with z of the rate of
interactions between galaxies (density evolution) and an increase of their IR
luminosity due to the more abundant fuel available in the past (luminosity
evolution). Very schematically, we associate the origin of the bulk of the
optical/NIR background to the quiescent evolution, while the CIRB is
interpreted as mostly due the dusty starburst phase (the latter possibly
leading to the formation of galaxy spheroids). The large energy contents in the
CIRB and optical backgrounds are not easily explained, considering the moderate
efficiency of energy generation by stars: a top-heavy stellar IMF associated
with the starburst phase (and compared with a more standard IMF during the
quiescent SF) would alleviate the problem. IR data suggest that the strong
observed evolution to z~1 should turn over at higher z: scenarios in which a
dominant fraction of stellar formation occurs at very high-z are not supported
by our analysis.

MgB2 will be a good material for both large scale applications and electronic
devices. During the last seven month, MgB2 has been fabricated in various

still to be resolved, a wide range of values being reported, between 1.2 and 9.
Also there is no consensus about the existence of a single anisotropic or
double energy gap. One central issue is whether or not MgB2 represents a new
class of superconductors, being the tip of an iceberg who awaits to be
discovered. Up to date MgB2 holds the record of the highest Tc in its class.
However, the discovery of superconductivity in MgB2 revived the interest in

occurs, when the sum of the two exchange interactions is ferromagnetic and it

novel exchange interaction arising from that of pair excitations of

multiple SDW are stabilized when their incommensurate ordering wave-numbers
$\pm{\bf Q}$ are multiple; magnetizations of different $\pm{\bf Q}$ components
are orthogonal to each other in double and triple SDW when magnetic anisotropy
is weak enough. Unless $\pm 2{\bf Q}$ are commensurate, charge density waves
(CDW) with $\pm 2{\bf Q}$ coexist with SDW with $\pm{\bf Q}$. Because the
quenching of magnetic moments by the Kondo effect depends on local numbers of
electrons, the phase of CDW or electron densities is such that magnetic moments
are large where the quenching is weak. It is proposed that the so called stipe

dynamics for this variable predict a mean (unforced) passage time $\tau$ that
scales as $N^2$, even in the presence of an entropic barrier. However, the time
it takes for a free polymer to diffuse a distance of the order of its radius by
Rouse dynamics scales with an exponent larger than 2, and this should provide a
lower bound to the translocation time. To resolve this discrepancy, we perform
numerical simulations with Rouse dynamics for both phantom (in space dimensions
$d=1$ and 2), and self-avoiding (in $d=2$) chains. The results indicate that
for large $N$, translocation times scale in the same manner as diffusion times,
but with a larger prefactor that depends on the size of the hole. Such scaling
implies anomalous dynamics for the translocation process. In particular, the

energy as well as force-minimization calculations, we found a shortest H-H
separation of 1.95 {\AA} in accordance with recent high resolution powder
neutron diffraction experiments. When the Th$_2$Al matrix is hydrogenated, the
volume expansion is highly anisotropic, which is quite opposite to other
hydrides having the same crystal structure. The bonding nature of these
materials are analyzed from the density of states, crystal-orbital Hamiltonian
population and valence-charge-density analyses. Our calculation predicts
different nature of bonding for the H atoms along $a$ and $c$. The strongest
bonding in Th$_2$AlH$_4$ is between Th and H along $c$ which form dumb-bell
shaped H-Th-H subunits. Due to this strong covalent interaction there is very
small amount of electrons present between H atoms along $c$ which makes
repulsive interaction between the H atoms smaller and this is the precise
reason why the 2 {\AA} rule is violated. The large difference in the
interatomic distances between the interstitial region where one can accommodate
H in the $ac$ and $ab$ planes along with the strong covalent interaction
between Th and H are the main reasons for highly anisotropic volume expansion
on hydrogenation of Th$_2$Al.

the quasiparticle band. $N({\bf k},\omega)$ is shown to lead to a strong

invariant and coincides with the Euclidean AdS_5 metric on the one-instanton

arbitrary boundary metric the AdS/CFT bulk space-time is the instanton moduli
space equipped with the Information Metric.
  To test this proposal, we examine the variation of the instanton moduli and
the Information Metric for first-order perturbations of the boundary metric and
obtain three non-trivial and somewhat surprising results: (1) The perturbed
Information Metric is Einstein. (2) The perturbed instanton density is the
corresponding massless boundary-to-bulk scalar propagator. (3) The regularized
boundary-to-bulk geodesic distance is proportional to the logarithm of the
perturbed instanton density. The Hamilton-Jacobi equation implied by (3) equips
the moduli space with a rich geometrical structure which we explore.
  These results tentatively suggest a picture in which the one-instanton sector
of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory (rather than some large-N limit) is in some sense
holographically dual to bulk gravity.

at 23.8 and 31.4 GHz and of retrievals of water vapor and liquid water path
from these brightness temperatures are evaluated using the detrended
fluctuation analysis method. As quantified by the parameter $\alpha$, this
method (i) enables identification of the time scales over which noise dominates
the time series and (ii) characterizes the temporal range of correlations in
the time series. The more common spectral analysis method is also used to
assess the data and its results are compared with those from detrended
fluctuation analysis method. The assumption that measurements should have
certain scaling properties allows the quality of the measurements to be
characterized. The additional assumption that the scaling properties of the
measurements of an atmospheric quantity are preserved in a useful retrieval
provides a means for evaluating the retrieval itself. Applying these two
assumptions to microwave radiometer measurements and retrievals demonstrates
three points. First, the retrieved water vapor path during cloudy-sky periods
can be dominated by noise on shorter than ~30~min time scales
($\alpha$-exponent = 0.1) and exhibits no scaling behavior at longer time
scales. However, correlations in the brightness temperatures and liquid water
path retrievals are found to be consistent with a power-law behavior for time
scales up to 3 hr with an $\alpha$-exponent equal to approximately 0.3, as in
other geophysical phenomena. Second, clear-sky, moist atmospheres show the
expected scaling for both measurements and retrievals of the water vapor path.
Third, during clear-sky, dry atmospheric days, instrument noise from the 31.4
GHz channel compromises the quality of the water vapor path retrieval.
