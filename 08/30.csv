protostellar collapse candidate, using data from HST/NICMOS and the W.M. Keck
Observatory. These data allow a new quantitative test of the ""inside-out""
collapse model previously proposed to explain molecular line profiles observed
toward this region. We find that the shape of the density profile is well
matched by the collapse model, but that the amount of extinction corresponds to
larger column densities than predicted. An unstable Bonnor-Ebert sphere with
dimensionless outer radius xi_max=12.5+/-2.6 provides an equally good
description of the density profile, and is indistinguishable from the collapse
model over the range in radius sampled by the data. The bipolar outflow driven
by the embedded YSO has an important effect on the extinction through the core,
and modeling the outflow as a hollowed-out bipolar cone of constant opening
angle provides a good match to theobservations. The complete exinction map is
well reproduced by a model that includes both infall and outflow, and an extra
20% dispersion that likely results from residual turbulent motions. This fitted
model has an infall radius of R_inf=26""+/-3""(0.031pc for 250pc distance), and
an outflow cone semi-opening angle of alpha=41+/-2 degrees. The fitted infall
radius is consistent with those derived from molecular line observations and
supports the inside-out collapse interpretation of the density structure. The
fitted opening angle of the outflow is slightly larger than observed in CO
emission, perhaps because the full extent of the outflow cone in CO becomes
confused with ambient core emission at low velocities.

forming star must somehow be removed or redistributed during the formation
process. The possible transport mechanisms and the possible fates of the excess
angular momentum are discussed, and it is argued that transport processes in
disks are probably not sufficient by themselves to solve the angular momentum
problem, while tidal interactions with other stars in forming binary or
multiple systems are likely to be of very general importance in redistributing
angular momentum during the star formation process. Most, if not all, stars
probably form in binary or multiple systems, and tidal torques in these systems
can transfer much of the angular momentum from the gas around each forming star
to the orbital motions of the companion stars. Tidally generated waves in
circumstellar disks may contribute to the overall redistribution of angular
momentum. Stars may gain much of their mass by tidally triggered bursts of
rapid accretion, and these bursts could account for some of the most energetic
phenomena of the earliest stages of stellar evolution, such as jet-like
outflows. If tidal interactions are indeed of general importance,
planet-forming disks may often have a more chaotic and violent early evolution
than in standard models, and shock heating events may be common. Interactions
in a hierarchy of subgroups may play a role in building up massive stars in
clusters and in determining the form of the upper IMF. Many of the processes
discussed here have analogs on galactic scales, and there may be similarities
between the formation of massive stars by interaction-driven accretion
processes in clusters and the buildup of massive black holes in galactic
nuclei.

  publication in ApJ",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present the Chandra observation of the cluster of galaxies MS 1455.0+2232.
  From previous ASCA and ROSAT observations, this cluster was identified as a
``relaxed'' cluster that hosts one of the most massive cooling flows detected.
With higher angular resolution, the Chandra X-ray image shows the presence of
two surface brightness edges on opposite sides of the X-ray peak: the first at
190 kpc to the north and the second at 450 kpc to the south. Even though the
low exposure of this observation limits our ability to constrain the
temperature jump across both edges, we show that the northern edge is likely to
be a ``cold front'' similar to others observed recently by Chandra in the
clusters A2142, A3667, RX J1720.1+2638, and A2256. The observed cold front is
most likely produced by the motion, from south to north, of a group-size dark
matter halo. The most natural explanation for the presence of this observed
moving subclump is that MS 1455.0+2232 is a merger cluster in the very last
stage before it becomes fully relaxed. This scenario, however, appears to be
unlikely as the cluster shows no further sign of ongoing merger. Moreover, it
is not clear if a massive cooling flow could have survived this kind of merger.
We propose an alternative scenario in which, as for RX J1720.1+2638, MS
1455.0+2232 is the result of the hierarchical collapse of two co-located
density perturbations, the first a group-scale perturbation collapse followed
by a second cluster-scale perturbation collapse that surrounded, but did not
destroy, the first. We suggest that a cooling flow may have begun inside the
already collapsed group-scale perturbation and may have been later amplified by
the gas compression induced by the infall of the overlying main cluster mass.

collapsed objects is reanalyzed. It has been suggested by many authors that the
PS mass function agrees well with the mass function given by $N$-body
simulations, while many too simple assumptions are contained in the formalism.
In order to understand why the PS formalism works well we consider the
following three effects on the mass function: the filtering effect of the
density fluctuation field, the peak ansatz in which objects collapse around
density maxima, and the spatial correlation of density contrasts within a
region of a collapsing halo because objects have non-zero finite volume.
According to the method given by Yano, Nagashima & Gouda (YNG) who used an
integral formula proposed by Jedamzik, we resolve the missing link in the PS
formalism, taking into account the three effects. While YNG showed that the
effect of the spatial correlation alters the original PS mass function, in this
paper, we show that the filtering effect almost cancels out the effect of the
spatial correlation and that the original PS is almost recovered by combining
these two effects, particularly in the case of the top-hat filter. On the other
hand, as for the peak ansatz, the resultant mass functions are changed
dramatically and not in agreement especially at low-mass tails in the cases of
the Gaussian and the sharp $k$-space filters. We show that these properties of
the mass function can be interpreted in terms of the kernel probability
$P(M_{1}| M_{2})$ in the integral formula qualitatively.

into the behaviour of the fundamental strong and electroweak interactions. This
thesis examines observations of B0, B0bar, and B+- mesons produced in
proton-antiproton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of sqrt{s}=1.8 TeV. The
B-meson decay products are recorded using the Collider Detector at Fermilab
(CDF) located on the Tevatron collider at Fermilab, USA. Four B-meson decays
and their charge conjugates are studied: B+ -> J/psi K+, B0 -> J/psi K*(892)0,
B+ -> psi(2S) K+, and B0 -> psi(2S) K*(892)0. Using a data sample corresponding
to a time-integrated luminosity of (109 +- 7)/pb, statistically significant
signals are observed in all the channels. Topological similarities between the
B decays are exploited to measure the six relative branching fractions (Br) of
each channel with respect to the other channels. The ratios involving the B+ ->
J/psi K+ mode are Br(B0 -> J/psi K*(892)0) / Br(B+ -> J/psi K+) = 1.76 +-
0.14[stat] +- 0.15[syst], Br(B+ -> psi(2S) K+) / Br(B+ -> J/psi K+) = 0.558 +-
0.082[stat] +- 0.056[syst], and Br(B0 -> psi(2S) K*(892)0) / Br(B+ -> J/psi K+)
= 0.908 +- 0.194[stat] +- 0.100[syst]. The indicated uncertainties are
statistical and systematic, respectively. In ratios involving unlike B-meson
species, equal production rates for B+ and B0 mesons have been assumed. The B+
-> psi(2S) K+ and B0 -> psi(2S) K*(892)0 reconstructions are the first
observations of these processes at a hadron collider. The branching-fraction
ratio measurements are consistent with phenomenological predictions that employ
the factorization Ansatz, and the derived absolute branching-fraction
measurements are consistent with previous world-average limits and values from
e+e- colliders. [abridged]

project aimed to produce a complete calculation for two-loop predictions in the
Standard Model. As a first step an algorithm, proposed by F. V. Tkachov and
based on the so-called generalized Bernstein functional relation, is applied to
one-loop multi-leg diagrams with particular emphasis to the presence of
infrared singularities, to the problem of tensorial reduction and to the
classification of all singularities of a given diagram. Successively, the
extension of the algorithm to two-loop diagrams is examined. The proposed
solution consists in applying the functional relation to the one-loop
sub-diagram which has the largest number of internal lines. In this way the
integrand can be made smooth, a part from a factor which is a polynomial in the
vector of Feynman parameters needed for the complementary sub-diagram with the
smallest number of internal lines. Since the procedure does not introduce new
singularities one can distort the integration hyper-contour into the complex
hyper-plane, thus achieving numerical stability. The algorithm is then modified
to deal with numerical evaluation around normal thresholds. Concise and
practical formulas are assembled and presented, numerical results and
comparisons with the available literature are shown and discussed for the
so-called sunset topology.

indicated the viability of operating X-band linacs with accelerating gradients
in excess of 100 MeV/m. Conventional scaling of traveling wave traveling wave
linacs with frequency scales the cell dimensions with l. Because Q scales as
l1/2, the length of the structures scale not linearly but as l3/2 in order to
preserve the attenuation through each structure. For NLC we chose not to follow
this scaling from the SLAC S-band linac to its fourth harmonic at X-band. We
wanted to increase the length of the structures to reduce the number of
couplers and waveguide drives which can be a significant part of the cost of a
microwave linac. Furthermore, scaling the iris size of the disk-loaded
structures gave unacceptably high short range dipole wakefields. Consequently,
we chose to go up a factor of about 5 in average group velocity and length of
the structures, which increases the power fed to each structure by the same
factor and decreases the short range dipole wakes by a similar factor.
Unfortunately, these longer (1.8 m) structures have not performed nearly as
well in high gradient tests as the short structures. We believe we have at
least a partial understanding of the reason and will discuss it below. We are
now studying two types of short structures with large apertures with moderately
good efficiency including: 1) traveling wave structures with the group velocity
lowered by going to large phase advance per period with bulges on the iris, 2)

  Submitted to special issue of American Journal of Physics","Am. J. Phys. 70, 719-737 (2002).","10.1119/1.1475328",,"quant-ph",,"  Quantum trajectory theory, developed largely in the quantum optics community
to describe open quantum systems subjected to continuous monitoring, has
applications in many areas of quantum physics. In this paper I present a simple
model, using two-level quantum systems (q-bits), to illustrate the essential
physics of quantum trajectories and how different monitoring schemes correspond
to different ``unravelings'' of a mixed state master equation. I also comment
briefly on the relationship of the theory to the Consistent Histories formalism
and to spontaneous collapse models.

Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs is proposed. In this model, it is the strict
obedience of conservation laws in each event at the quantum level that uphold
the perfect correlation of two spatially-separated particles, instead of
nonlocality in the orthodox formulation of quantum mechanics. Therefore, one
can conclude that all components of the spin of two particles, and the position
and momentum of a particle can be measured simultaneously. The proposed model
yields the same statistical prediction on an ensemble of individual particles
as the orthodox formulation does. This suggests that the wave function is not a
complete description of individual particle as assumed in the orthodox
formulation, but only a statistical description of an ensemble of particles.
