used to probe the universe. Clues about how and when was the intergalactic
medium ionized can be read off the UV emission spectrum of GRB explosions from
the first generation of stars. The existence of intergalactic and galactic
stars can be inferred from their gravitational microlensing effect on GRB
afterglows. Prior to reionization, quasars should be surrounded by a halo of
scattered Lyman-alpha radiation which probes the neutral intergalactic medium
(IGM) around them. The situation is analogous to the appearance of a halo of
scattered light around a street lamp which is embedded in a dense fog. Outflows
from quasars magnetize the IGM at all redshifts. As a result, the shocks
produced by converging flows during the formation of large scale structure in
the IGM, accelerate electrons to relativistic energies and become visible in
the radio regime through their synchrotron emission and in the gamma-ray regime
through their inverse-Compton scattering of the microwave background photons.
During transient episodes of strong mergers, X-ray clusters should therefore
appear as extended radio or gamma-ray sources on the sky.

contrasts with the enormous far-infrared luminosity of this galaxy based on our

new discoveries made using the Two Micron All Sky Survey. These objects are
distinguished from warmer (L-type) brown dwarfs by the presence of methane
absorption bands in the 1--2.5 $\micron$ spectral region. A first attempt at a
near-infrared classification scheme for T dwarfs is made, based on the
strengths of CH$_4$ and H$_2$O bands and the shapes of the 1.25, 1.6, and 2.1
$\micron$ flux peaks. Subtypes T1 V through T8 V are defined, and spectral
indices useful for classification are presented. The subclasses appear to
follow a decreasing T$_{eff}$ scale, based on the evolution of CH$_4$ and
H$_2$O bands and the properties of L and T dwarfs with known distances.
However, we speculate that this scale is not linear with spectral type for cool
dwarfs, due to the settling of dust layers below the photosphere and subsequent
rapid evolution of spectral morphology around T$_{eff}$ $\sim$ 1300--1500 K.
Similarities in near-infrared colors and continuity of spectral features
suggest that the gap between the latest L dwarfs and earliest T dwarfs has been
nearly bridged. This argument is strengthened by the possible role of CH$_4$ as
a minor absorber shaping the K-band spectra of the latest L dwarfs. Finally, we
discuss one peculiar T dwarf, 2MASS 0937+2931, which has very blue
near-infrared colors (J-K$_s$ = $-0.89\pm$0.24) due to suppression of the 2.1
$\micron$ peak. The feature is likely caused by enhanced collision-induced
H$_2$ absorption in a high pressure or low metallicity photosphere.

small number of stars with high membership probabilities lie redward of the red
giant branch. The brightest (V <= 18) such stars are known to be Carbon stars,
rather than metal-rich first-ascent giants. A number of stars with high
membership probabilities lie blueward of the red giant branch, and are more
luminous than the horizontal branch. We speculate that these are
post-horizontal branch stars. There may also be one or two stars in the
post-AGB phase. Spectroscopy of the candidate post-HB and post-AGB stars is
required to determine their nature. We recover the internal substructure in
Ursa Minor that has been noted by several authors in the last 15 years. Using a
variety of two- and three-dimensional statistical tests, we conclude that this
substructure is statistically significant at the 0.005 level. There is no
evidence that the regions of density excess have stellar populations that
differ from the main body of Ursa Minor. The crossing time for a typical
density excess is only ~5 million years. They are therefore clearly not due to
intermediate age star-forming bursts. We conclude that they are instead due to
tidal interactions between the Galaxy and Ursa Minor.

equations. The outflow is quite strong in our model, with the velocity
increasing in proportion to radius, and material formally escaping to infinity
in the finite time required for the central singularity to develop.
  Analytically tractable collapse models have been limited mainly to
spherically symmetric collapse, with neither magnetic field nor rotation. Other
analyses usually employ extensive numerical simulations, or either perturbative
or quasistatic techniques. Our model is unique as an exact solution to the
non-stationary equations of self-gravitating MHD, which features co-existing
regions of infall and outflow.
  The velocity and magnetic topology of our model is quadrupolar, although
dipolar solutions may also exist. We provide a qualitative model for the origin
and subsequent evolution of such a state. However, a central singularity forms
at late times, and we expect the late time behaviour to be dominated by the
singularity rather than to depend on the details of its initial state. Our
solution may, therefore, have the character of an attractor among a much more

effect on evolution and on pulsation, followed by the metal abundance. Changes
to the helium content have very little effect on the frequencies until near the
end of the main sequence. Changes to each of the four parameters change the

suppresses the cooling of the diffuse hot gas onto galaxy discs. By using a
semi-analytic model without the effect of the UVB, Kauffmann & Charlot found
that the CMR can be reproduced by strong supernova heating because such
supernova feedback suppresses the chemical enrichment in galaxies especially
for small galaxies. We find that the CMR also becomes bluer because of the UVB,
in a different way from the effect of supernova feedback. While the supernova
feedback suppresses the chemical enrichment by a similar mechanism to galactic
wind, the UVB suppresses the cooling of the hot gas. This fact induces the
suppression of the metallicity of the intracluster medium (ICM). In our model
we find that the existence of the UVB can plausibly account for an observed ICM
metallicity that is equal to nearly 0.3 times the solar value, and that in this
case we can reproduce the CMR and the metallicity of the ICM simultaneously.

approximately linear relation with the luminosity of the host bulge, with the
black hole mass being 0.001-0.002 of the bulge mass. Previous work suggested
that black holes of active (Seyfert 1) galaxies follow a similar relation, but
apparently with a significantly lower value of $M_{\rm BH}/M_{\rm bulge}$
(Wandel 1999). New data show that this difference was mainly due to
overestimating the black hole mass in quiescent galaxies and overestimating the
bulge magnitude of Seyfert galaxies. Using new and updated data we show that
AGNs (Seyfert galaxies and quasars) follow the same BH-bulge relation as
ordinary (inactive) galaxies. We derive the BH-bulge relation for a sample of
55 AGNs and 35 quiescent galaxies, finding that broad line AGNs have an average
black hole/bulge mass fraction of $\sim 0.0015$ with a strong correlation (Mbh
~ Lbulge^{0.9\pm 0.16}). This BH-bulge relation is consistent with the BH-bulge
relation of quiescent galaxies and much tighter than previous results. Narrow
line AGNs appear to have a lower ratio, Mbh/Mbulge ~ 10^{-4}-10^{-3}. We find
this to be a more general feature, the BH/bulge ratio in AGNs being inversely
correlated with the emission-line width, implying a strong linear relation
between the size of the broad emission line region and the luminosity of the
bulge. Finally, combining AGNs with observed and estimated stellar velocity
dispersion, we find a significant correlation (Mbh ~ v^{3.5-5}), consistent
with that of quiescent galaxies.

Several, mathematically equivalent but physically different expressions of the
criterion for wind generation are obtained. It is suggested also that the
generation of wind is a consequence of the intervention of some mechanism that
redistributes the locally available gravitational energy, and that the
Bernoulli sum can be a good indicator of the existence of such mechanisms.

limit on the brightness temperature of about 3X10^8 K. This result rules out a
thermal origin for the radio emission and strongly suggests an emission
mechanism similar to that observed in more powerful radio-loud AGNs. Since, by

1.4 GHz and 8.4 GHz, the observed radio emission could be relativistically
beamed. Multi-epoch VLBI observations can confirm this possibility in two years

large-scale and predominantly toroidal magnetic field originating from the
central engine (a star, a black hole, or an accretion disk). Besides the
problem of how such a large-scale magnetic field is generated, in this model
the jet suffers from the fatal long-wave mode kink magnetohydrodynamic
instability. In this paper we explore an alternative model: jet collimation by
small-scale magnetic fields. These magnetic fields are assumed to be local,
chaotic, tangled, but are dominated by toroidal components. Just as in the case
of a large-scale toroidal magnetic field, we show that the ``hoop stress'' of
the tangled toroidal magnetic fields exerts an inward force which confines and
collimates the jet. The magnetic ``hoop stress'' is balanced either by the gas
pressure of the jet, or by the centrifugal force if the jet is spinning. Since
the length-scale of the magnetic field is small (< the cross-sectional radius
of the jet << the length of the jet), in this model the jet does not suffer
from the long-wave mode kink instability. Many other problems associated with
the large-scale magnetic field are also eliminated or alleviated for
small-scale magnetic fields. Though it remains an open question how to generate
and maintain the required small-scale magnetic fields in a jet, the scenario of
jet collimation by small-scale magnetic fields is favored by the current study
on disk dynamo which indicates that small-scale magnetic fields are much easier
to generate than large-scale magnetic fields.

discuss possible signature of the unit cell doubling associated with the

a topological defect [SU(2) vortex] freezes the SF state inside the vortex
core. Consequently, the unit cell doubling shows up in the hopping
($\chi_{ij}$) and pairing ($\Delta_{ij}$) order parameters of physical
electrons. We find that whereas the center in the vortex core is a SF state, as
one moves away from the core center, a correlated staggered modulation of
$\chi_{ij}$ and $\Delta_{ij}$ becomes predominant. We predict that over the
region outside the core and inside the internal gauge field penetration depth
around a vortex center, the local density-of-states (LDOS) exhibits staggered
peak-dip (SPD) structure inside the V-shaped profile when measured on the
bonds. The SPD structure has its direct origin in the unit cell doubling
associated with the SF core and the robust topological texture, which has
little to do with the symmetry of the d-wave order parameter. Therefore the
structure may survive the tunneling matrix element effects and easily be
detected by STM experiment.

response regime, both a quantum field theory treatment and a meanfield
Gross-Pitaevskii treatment lead to the same value for the mean evolution of the
quasiparticle operators. The observable for Bragg spectroscopy experiments,
which is the spectral response function of the momentum transferred to the
condensate, can therefore be calculated in a meanfield formalism. We analyse
the behaviour of this observable by carrying out numerical simulations in
axially symmetric three-dimensional cases and in two dimensions. An approximate
analytic expression for the observable is obtained and provides a means for
identifying the relative importance of three broadening and shift mechanisms
(meanfield, Doppler, and finite pulse duration) in different regimes. We show
that the suppression of scattering at small values of q observed by
Stamper-Kurn et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 2876 (1999)] is accounted for by the
meanfield treatment, and can be interpreted in terms of the interference of the
u and v quasiparticle amplitudes. We also show that, contrary to the
assumptions of previous analyses, there is no regime for trapped condensates
for which the spectral response function and the dynamic structure factor are
equivalent. Our numerical calculations can also be performed outside the linear
response regime, and show that at large laser intensities a significant
decrease in the shift of the spectral response function can occur due to

combination of exact numerical solutions of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations
and weak localization calculations, which suggest that a novel diffusive mode
with momentum $(\pi ,\pi)$ is responsible for a divergence of the DOS in the
globally particle-hole symmetric case. We note briefly that the simple problem
of a disordered tight-binding band of normal electrons displays some similar
effects, which have been overlooked in the literature. Finally, in the
physically realistic case of binary alloy disorder, no particle-hole symmetry,
and an order parameter which is supressed around each impurity site, a power
law with nonuniversal exponent is predicted.

or perfect-fluid spacetimes with a helical Killing vector k^\alpha,
heuristically, the generator of time-translations in a corotating frame.
Systems that are stationary in this sense are not asymptotically flat, but have
asymptotic behavior corresponding to equal amounts of ingoing and outgoing
radiation. For black-hole binaries, a rigidity theorem implies that the Killing
vector lies along the horizon's generators, and from this one can deduce the
zeroth law (constant surface gravity of the horizon). Remarkably, although the
mass and angular momentum of such a system are not defined, there is an exact
first law, relating the change in the asymptotic Noether charge to the changes
in the vorticity, baryon mass, and entropy of the fluid, and in the area of
black holes.
  Binary systems with M\Omega small have an approximate asymptopia in which one
can write the first law in terms of the asymptotic mass and angular momentum.
Asymptotic flatness is precise in two classes of solutions used to model binary
systems: spacetimes satisfying the post-Newtonian equations, and solutions to a
modified set of field equations that have a spatially conformally flat metric.
(The spatial conformal flatness formalism with helical symmetry, however, is
consistent with maximal slicing only if replaces the extrinsic curvature in the
field equations by an artificially tracefree expression in terms of the shift
vector.) For these spacetimes, nearby equilibria whose stars have the same
vorticity obey the relation \delta M = \Omega \delta J, from which one can
obtain a turning point criterion that governs the stability of orbits.

equation for diffractive dissociation processes in deep inelastic scattering.
It is shown that the solution depends on one scaling variable $\tau = Q^2/Q^{D

processes. The dependence of the saturation scale $Q^D_s(x,x_0)$ on both $x$
and $x_0$ is investigated, ($Y_0 = \ln(1/x_0)$ is a minimal rapidity gap for
the diffraction process). The $x$ - dependence of $Q^D_s$ turns out to be the
same as of the saturation scale in the total inclusive DIS cross section. In
our calculations $Q^D_s(x,x_0)$ reveals only mild dependence on $x_0$. The
scaling is shown to hold for $x \ll x_0$ but is violated at $ x \sim x_0$.

relies on a polytope reinterpretation of the problem: the elementary couplings
are associated to the vertices of the polytope while the inequalities defining
the fusion basis are the facets. The symmetry group of the polytope associated
to the lowest rank affine Lie algebras is found; it has order 24 for $\su(2)$,
432 for $\su(3)$ and quite surprisingly, it reduces to 36 for $\su(4)$, while
it is only of order 4 for $\sp(4)$. This drastic reduction in the order of the

of many linear relations between the elementary couplings that break most of

of some medium and heavy nuclei are investigated. The long-range correlations
are treated within the Random Phase Approximation framework and the short-range
correlations with a model inspired to the Correlation Basis Function theory.
The two type of correlations produce effects of the same order of magnitude. A
comparison with the empirical charge distribution difference between 206Pb and
205Tl shows the need of including both correlations to obtain a good
description of the data.

an intense laser beam with a plasma slab is presented. It is observed that the
laser generated electron current decays into magnetically isolated filaments.
The filaments grow in scale and magnitude by a merging process in the course of
which the field topology changes. The opposite process also takes place
occasionally. The laser driven charge and energy flows and the reconnecting
magnetic field mutually interact. At the end of the merging process flows and
fields are confined close to the laser irradiated surface of the plasma slab.
Both decay rapidly in the bulk plasma. Due to the magnetic pressure in the
filaments hollow density channels in the electron and ion densities are formed.
The simulation reveals that charge flows in these channels can exceed the
Alfven current.

the statistical approach is needed to penetrate into the nature of observed

annihilation-operator coherent states of the C_{\lambda}-extended oscillator
spectrum generating algebra for higher \lambda values. The second ones, which
are eigenstates of the C_{\lambda}-extended oscillator annihilation operator,
extend to higher \lambda values the paraboson coherent states, to which they
reduce for \lambda=2. All these states satisfy a unity resolution relation in
the C_{\lambda}-extended oscillator Fock space (or in some subspace thereof).
They give rise to Bargmann representations of the latter, wherein the
generators of the C_{\lambda}-extended oscillator algebra are realized as
differential-operator-valued matrices (or differential operators). The
statistical and squeezing properties of the new coherent states are
investigated over a wide range of parameters and some interesting nonclassical
features are exhibited.
