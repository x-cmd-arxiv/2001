at the Galactic center (GC), Sgr A*, and its temporal variations in the past is
imprinted in the scattered emission observed today in the direction towards
giant molecular clouds (GMCs) located in our Galaxy. Due to light travel time
effects these clouds probe the activity of Sgr A* at different times in the
past depending on their position relative to the GC and the observer. In this
paper we combine results of recent ASCA observations along the Galactic plane,
providing upper limits for the scattered flux in the 4-10 keV range produced in
a given direction, with data from CO surveys of the same regions. These CO
surveys map the position and mass of the molecular gas which the GMCs are made
up of. Demanding the scattered flux to be not larger than the observed one,
this data enables us to derive upper limits for the 4-10 keV luminosity of Sgr
A* at certain times during the last 40.000 years down to about 8*10^40 erg/s.
At other times the limits are less tight, of the order of 10^41-10^42 erg/s.
The more extended and continuous HI distribution in the Galactic disk, which
also scatters the radiation emitted by Sgr A*, allows us to extend the time
coverage further into the past, back to about 110.000 years, albeit the limits
are becoming less tight. We thereby can rule out a long term X-ray activity
phase of Sgr A* at one per cent of its Eddington level ending less than about
80.000 years ago. The limits presented in this paper can be improved by
observations of emission in the fluorescent iron K_alpha-line. We study the
feasibility of these methods to investigate past nuclear activity in other
spiral galaxies observed with the angular resolution of X-ray telescopes like
Chandra and XMM-Newton.

this compression may have been triggered by heating of the interstellar medium

the direction of the old globular cluster M22, detected six events in which
otherwise constant stars brightened by ~50% during a time of <1 day. They
tentatively interpret these unresolved events as due to microlensing of
background bulge stars by free-floating planets in M22. I show that if these
spike events are due to microlensing, the lensing objects are unlikely to be
associated with M22, and unlikely to be part of a smoothly distributed Galactic
population. Thus either there happens to be a massive, dark cluster of planets
along our line-of-sight to M22, or the spike events are not due to
microlensing. The lensing planets cannot be bound to stars in the core of M22:
if they were closer than 8 AU, the lensing influence of the parent star would
have been detectable. Moreover, in the core of M22, all planets with
separations > 1 AU would have been ionized by random stellar encounters. Most
unbound planets would have escaped the core via evaporation which
preferentially affects such low-mass objects. Bound or free-floating planets
can exist in the outer halo of M22; however, for reasonable assumptions, the
maximum optical depth to such a population falls short of the observed optical
depth, tau ~ 3x10^{-6}, by a factor of 5-10. Therefore, if real, these events
represent the detection of a significant free-floating Galactic planet
population. The optical depth to these planets is comparable to and mutually
exclusive from the optical depth to resolved events measured by microlensing
survey collaborations toward the bulge, and thus implies a similar additional
mass of lensing objects. Such a population is difficult to reconcile with both
theory and observations.

dimensions. The extra dimension is compactified on an S^1/(Z_2 x Z_2^\prime)
orbifold which has two in-equivalent fixed points. These are flat 4-dimensional
Minkowski spaces: the visible and the hidden branes. By orbifolding, the gauge
symmetry on the hidden brane is reduced down to the Pati--Salam gauge symmetry
SU(4) x SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R. On the visible brane the SO(10) is broken by the
ordinary Higgs mechanism down to SU(5). The resulting 4-dimensional theory has
the standard model gauge symmetry (the intersection of SU(5) and SU(4) x
SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R) and the massless spectrum consists of the MSSM gauge fields
and two Higgs doublets. The matter fields are assumed to live on the visible
brane. We discuss gauge coupling unification in our 5-dimensional model in
terms of corrections to the conventional 4-dimensional unification.
Supersymmetry is broken on the hidden brane (where mass terms for gauginos and
a mu term are generated) and communicated to squarks and sleptons via gaugino
mediation. We also discuss a possibility of linking the supersymmetry breaking
on the hidden brane to the Higgs mechanism responsible for partial breaking of
the gauge symmetry on the visible brane via the shining mechanism. Finally,
there are no operators of dimension 5 leading to proton decay. Proton decay
through dimension 6 operators is enhanced compared to conventional GUTs and can
be seen in current or next generation proton decay experiments.

lays out the fundamental building blocks for the analysis in all dimensions. We
consider (a) the point process of self-intersections defined via certain paths
of length n of the symmetric simple random walk in Z^d and (b) a ``weakly
self-avoiding cone process'' relative to this point process in a certain
""shape"". The asymptotic expected distance of the process in (b) can be
calculated rather precisely as n tends large and, if the point process has
circular shape, can be shown to asymptotically equal (up to error terms) the
one of the weakly SAW with parameter \beta >0. From these results, a number of
distance exponents are immediately collectable for the SAW as well. Our
approach invokes the Palm distribution of the point process of

neutron-rich nuclei, we study the first-order direct transverse flow of protons
and their second-order differential elliptic flow as a function of transverse
momentum. It is found that the differential elliptic flow of mid-rapidity
protons, especially at high transverse momenta, is much more sensitive to the
isospin dependence of the nuclear equation of state than the direct flow.
Origins of these different sensitivities and their implications to the
experimental determination of the isospin dependence of the nuclear equation of
state by using neutron-rich heavy-ion collisions at intermediate energies are
discussed.

quantum correlations appearing in the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH)
inequality is bound by $2 \sqrt 2$. It is shown that the correlations of two
qubits belonging to a three-qubit system can violate the CHSH inequality beyond
$2 \sqrt 2$. Such a violation is not in conflict with Cirel'son's inequality
because it is based on postselected systems. The maximum allowed violation of
the CHSH inequality, 4, can be achieved using a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
state.

will be discrete and real.This has been illustrated with several potentials

matching condition for a successful search. The optimal options for these phase
are obtained consequently.
