This spectral gradient may not be due to simple particle aging but could be

microwave sky with angular resolution and instrumental noise at the mean
nominal levels for the Planck satellite, containing the most important known
diffuse signals: the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Galactic synchrotron,
dust and free-free emissions. A method for calibrating the reconstructed maps
of each component at each frequency has been devised. The spatial pattern of
all the components have been recovered on all scales probed by the instrument.
In particular, the CMB angular power spectra is recovered at the percent level
up to $\ell_{max}\simeq 2000$. Frequency scalings and normalization have been
recovered with better than percent precision for all the components at
frequencies and in sky regions where their signal-to-noise ratio exceeds 1.5;
the error increases at ten percent level for signal-to-noise ratios about 1.
Runs have been performed on a Pentium III 600 MHz computer; FastICA typically
took a time of the order of 10 minutes for all-sky simulations with 3.5
arcminutes pixel size. We conclude that FastICA is an extremly promising
technique for analyzing the maps that will be obtained by the forthcoming high

It appears that LMXBs very frequently contain nuclear-evolved companions, even

consistent with Maxwell's and the MHD equations. Here, we reveal which relevant
plasma physical processes are implemented by the X-CA model and in what form,
and what global physical set-up is assumed by this model when it is in its

show characteristic quasi-symmetries. (2) The global magnetic topology forms
either (i) closed magnetic field lines, or (ii) an arcade of field lines above
the bottom plane line, if the model is slightly modified. (3) In case of the
magnetic topology (ii), loading can be interpreted as if there were a plasma
which flows predominantly upwards, whereas in case of the magnetic topology
(i), as if there were a plasma flow expanding from the neutral line. (4) The
small-scale physics in the bursting phase represent localized diffusive
processes. (5) The local diffusivity usually has a value which is effectively
zero, and it turns locally to an anomalous value if a threshold is exceeded,
whereby diffusion dominates the quiet evolution (loading). (6) Flares
(avalanches) are accompanied by the appearance of localized, intense electric
fields. (7) In a variant on the X-CA model, the magnitude of the current is
used directly in the instability criterion. First results indicate that the SOC
state persists. (8) The current-dissipation during flares is spatially
fragmented into a large number of dissipative current-surfaces of varying

of the nonthermal radiation through inverse Compton (IC) and synchrotron

mergers. We estimate the typical accretion rate and merger probability
according to a hierarchical clustering model. We show that the total luminosity
of IC emission from accreting and merging clusters are similar. On the other
hand, the luminosity of synchrotron radio emission of the former is much
smaller than that of the latter. We show that about 10% of clusters at z~0
should have hard X-ray and radio nonthermal emissions due to their last major
merger, which are comparable to or dominate those due to ongoing accretion.
Moreover, 20-40% of clusters should have significant EUV emission due to their
last merger. We also investigate the case where the criterion of mergers is
relaxed. If we extend the definition of a merger to an increase in the mass of
the larger subcluster by at least 10% of its initial mass, about 20-30% of
clusters at z~0 should have hard X-ray and radio nonthermal emissions due to
the merger even in a low density universe. We compare the results with
observations. We find that the observed EUV emission from clusters is not
attributed to accretion. If the diffuse radio emission observed in clusters is
synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated via accretion or merging, the

observing spectral variability on timescales comparable to the dynamical time
of the inner accretion flow. They typically show highly variable lightcurves,
with Power Density Spectra characterized by `red noise' and a break at low
frequencies. Time resolved spectral analysis have established that spectral
variability on the shortest timescales is important in all these sources, with
the spectra getting softer at high fluxes. Here we present a model that is able
to explain a number of the above mentioned properties in terms of magnetic
flares shining above a standard accretion disc and producing the X-ray spectrum
via inverse Compton scattering soft photons (both intrinsic and reprocessed
thermal emission from the accretion disc and locally produced synchrotron
radiation). We show that the fundamental heating event, likely caused by
magnetic reconnection, must be compact, with typical size comparable to the
accretion disc thickness and must be triggered at a height at least an order of
magnitude larger than its size; the spatial and temporal distribution of flares
are not random: the heating of the corona proceeds in correlated trains of
events in an avalanche fashion. The amplitude of the avalanches obeys a
power-law distribution and determines the size of the active regions where the
spectrum is produced. With our model we simulate X-ray lightcurves that
reproduce the main observational properties of the Power Density Spectra and of
the X-ray continuum short-term variability of Seyfert 1 galaxies. By comparing

simple quadrature. The cusps are always located at the turning points of the
shape function. We show that the models with exactly elliptic isophotes never
admit butterfly or swallowtail cusps and so have at most 4 (or 5) images.
Higher order imaging is brought about by deviations of the isophotes from pure
ellipses -- such as pointedness caused by embedded disks or boxiness caused by
recent merging. The criteria for the onset of sextuple and octuple imaging can
be calculated analytically in terms of the ellipticity and the fourth-order
Fourier coefficients (a_4 and b_4) used by observers to parametrise the
isophote shapes. The 6 or 8 images are arranged roughly in a circle, which
appears as an incomplete Einstein ring if inadequately resolved. Using data on

particular, the orbital magnetoresistance (OMR) varies with y but is
strain-independent. The relations for the resistivity and the Hall angle and
the proportionality between the OMR and tan^2 theta are followed about 70 K. We
have been able to separate the strain and impurity effects by rewriting the

supressed by the addition of impurities than tan^2 theta. We conclude that the

dynamics of biopolymers via the nonlinearity-induced buckling and collapse
(i.e. coiling up) instabilities. Taking into account the coupling between the

we show that self-trapped internal excitations (such as amide-I vibrations in
proteins, base-pair vibrations in DNA, or polarons in proteins) may produce the
buckling and collapse instabilities of an initially straight chain. These
instabilities remain latent in a straight infinitely long chain, because the
bending of such a chain would require an infinite energy. However, they
manifest themselves as soon as we consider more realistic cases and take into
account a finite length of the chain. In this case the nonlinear localized
modes may act as drivers giving impetus to the conformational dynamics of
biopolymers. The buckling instability is responsible, in particular, for the
large-amplitude localized bending waves which accompany the nonlinear modes
propagating along the chain. In the case of the collapse instability, the chain
folds into a compact three-dimensional coil. The viscous damping of the aqueous
environment only slows down the folding of the chain, but does not stop it even
for a large damping. We find that these effects are only weakly affected by the
peculiarities of the interaction potentials, and thus they should be generic
for different models of semiflexible chains carrying nonlinear localized
excitations.

  Previous works with a model calculation of minimizing Gibbs free energy have
suggested that the peaks could be ascribed to vortex line transitions for
spatial commensuration in a thin film superconductor. In order to directly
determine the distribution of vortices, we performed SPNR measurements on the
multilayer and found that the distribution and density of vortices are
different at ascending and descending fields. At ascending 2000 Oe which is
just below the first peak in the M-H curve, SPNR shows that vortices are mostly
localized near a middle line of the film meanwhile the vortices are distributed
in broader region at the descending 2000 Oe. That is related to the observation
of more vortices trapped at the descending field. As the applied field is
sightly tilted (< 3.5degree), we observe another peak at a smaller field. The
peak position is consistent with the parallel lower critical field (Hc1||). We
discuss that the vortices run along the applied field below Hc1|| and rotate
parallel to the surface at Hc1||.

noticed both in the speckle pattern variation and in the decrease of the total

production excludes the possibility of an electron neutrino asymmetry
generation and we conclude that $\Delta N_{\nu}^{\rm tot}\simeq 1$, in

electric-magnetic duality transformation of Maxwell's equations, in contrast to
the even parity of the stress-energy and zilch conservation laws. The main
result of the classification establishes that every local conservation law of

conservation laws, and their higher order extensions obtained by replacing the
electromagnetic field tensor by its repeated Lie derivatives with respect to

particular, Gessel-Viennot matrices are equivalent to Kasteleyn-Percus
matrices.
  We apply these ideas to plane partitions and related planar of tilings. We
list a number of conjectures, supported by experiments in Maple, about the
forms of matrices associated to enumerations of plane partitions and other
lozenge tilings of planar regions and their symmetry classes. We focus on the
case where the enumerations are round or $q$-round, and we conjecture that
cokernels remain round or $q$-round for related ``impossible enumerations'' in
which there are no tilings. Our conjectures provide a new view of the topic of
enumerating symmetry classes of plane partitions and their generalizations. In
particular we conjecture that a $q$-specialization of a Jacobi-Trudi matrix has
a Smith normal form. If so it could be an interesting structure associated to
the corresponding irreducible representation of $\SL(n,\C)$. Finally we find,
with proof, the normal form of the matrix that appears in the enumeration of
domino tilings of an Aztec diamond.

inverting a one-way function to the problem of predicting a particular bit
associated with that function. We show that the quantum version of the
reduction -- between quantum one-way functions and quantum hard-predicates --
is quantitatively more efficient than the known classical version. Roughly
speaking, if the one-way function acts on n-bit strings then the overhead in
the reduction is by a factor of O(n/epsilon^2) in the classical case but only
by a factor of O(1/epsilon) in the quantum case, where 1/2 + epsilon is the
probability of predicting the hard-predicate. Moreover, we prove via a lower
bound that, in a black-box framework, the classical version of the reduction
cannot have overhead less than order n/epsilon^2.
  We also show that, using this reduction, a quantum bit commitment scheme that
is perfectly binding and computationally concealing can be obtained from any
quantum one-way permutation. This complements a recent result by Dumais, Mayers
and Salvail, where the bit commitment scheme is perfectly concealing and
computationally binding. We also show how to perform qubit commitment by a
similar approach.
