  variations of the Herbig Ae/Be star MWC 1080","30 pages, 8 figures, to be published in the Astronomical Journal",,"10.1086/324108",,"astro-ph",,"  We present polarimetric observations of a massive pre-main sequence
short-period binary star of the Herbig Ae/Be type, MWC 1080. The mean
polarization at 7660 A is 1.60% at 81.6 deg, or 0.6% at 139 deg if an estimate
of the interstellar polarization is subtracted. The intrinsic polarization
points to an asymmetric geometry of the circumstellar or circumbinary
environment while the 139 deg intrinsic position angle traces the axis of
symmetry of the system and is perpendicular to the position angle of the
outflow cavity. The polarization and its position angle are clearly variable,
at all wavelengths, and on time scales of hours, days, months, and years.
Stochastic variability is accompanied by periodic variations caused by the
orbital motion of the stars in their dusty environment. These periodic
polarimetric variations are the first phased-locked ones detected for a
pre-main sequence binary. The variations are not simply double-periodic (seen
twice per orbit) but include single-periodic (seen once per orbit) and
higher-order variations. The presence of single-periodic variations could be
due to non equal mass stars, the presence of dust grains, an asymmetric
configuration of the circumstellar or circumbinary material, or the
eccentricity of the orbit. MWC 1080 is an eclipsing binary with primary and
secondary eclipses occurring at phases 0.0 and 0.55. The signatures of the
eclipses are seen in the polarimetric observations.

weak, low-ionization optical emission lines. In the X-ray band, these objects

better understand their possible connection to LINERs and the structure of the
accretion flow in both these systems. Here, we present new optical spectra of a
sample of WLRGs. We find that 81% of the objects have optical emission-line

the information about small scales can be extracted from observations. This

  We investigate the survival of dust in the extended ionised gas of nearby
active galaxies with jet/gas interactions. We discuss the implications on the

although shocks are likely to destroy dust grains in regions of interaction,
dust might survive in enough quantities to scatter light from the active

shocked regions based on the sensitivity of calcium to depletion onto dust
grains.

spectra of accreting black holes. Indeed, in the framework of a thermal corona
model, we expect that part (or even all, depending on the coronal covering
factor) of the reflection features should cross the hot plasma, and thus suffer
Compton scattering, before being observed. We have studied in detail the
dependence of these effects on the physical (i.e. temperature and optical
depth) and geometrical (i.e. inclination angle) parameters of the corona,
concentrating on the slab geometry . Due to the smoothing and shifting towards
high energies of the comptonized reflection hump, the main effects on the
emerging spectra appear above 100 keV. We have also investigated the importance
of such effects on the interpretation of the results obtained with the standard
fitting procedures. We found that fitting Comptonization models, taking into
account comptonized reflection, by the usual cut-off power law + uncomptonized
reflection model, may lead to an underestimation of the reflection
normalization and an overestimation of the high energy cut-off. We discuss and
illustrate the importance of these effects by analysing recent observational
results as those of the galaxy NGC 4258. We also find that the comptonizing
corona can produce and/or emphasize correlations between the reflection
features characteristics (like the iron line equivalent width or the covering
fraction) and the X-ray spectral index similar to those recently reported in
the literature. We also underline the importance of these effects when dealing
with accurate spectral fitting of the X-ray background.

stable against tidal shear than non-rotating clouds. They can approach the

shear due to the gravitational potential. For smaller radii the clouds either
collapse or become tidally disrupted. We suggest that this mechanism is

accretion disks around black holes could lead to the neutron production via
dissociation of helium nuclei. We show that, for a broad range of accretion
parameters, neutrons effectively decouple from protons and pile up in the inner
disk leading to the formation of self-sustained halo. This means that new
neutrons in the halo are supplied mainly by the splitting of helium nuclei in
their collisions with existing neutrons. Once formed, such a halo can exist
even if the proton temperature is much lower than the energy threshold of
helium dissociation. We show that neutron haloes can be the natural source of
relativistic electrons and positrons, providing characteristic comptonization
spectra and hard spectral tails observed in many black hole candidates, and
also giving rise to relativistic outflows. Deuterium gamma-ray line at 2.2 MeV
resulting from neutron capture is also expected at a level detectable by future
INTEGRAL mission. Furthermore, the presence of a neutron halo strongly affects
the dynamics of accretion and leads to the rich variety of transient dynamical
regimes.

in energy generated by coupling to pure-gluonic parity-odd operators is always
a growing function of the external fields along the real axis, independent of
the mode in which symmetry is realized. In light of this, although there is
little doubt that parity is not spontaneously broken in massive QCD, the

invariance is much more obscure. The problem goes beyond the determination of
an ordering of the U(N)-valued fields, because one can show that there is no
lift of ordinary diffeomorphisms to matrix-valued diffeomorphisms. On the other
hand, the action can presumably be constructed from perturbative string theory
calculations. Based on the general characteristics of such calculations we
determine a set of constraints on the action for N D0-branes, that ensure
space-time covariance. These constraints can be solved order by order, but they
are insufficient to determine the action completely. All solutions to the
constraints obey the axioms of D-geometry. Moreover the action must contain new

  Derivation and Analysis","22 pages",,,,"nlin.PS",,"  Vocal fold (VF) motion is fundamental to voice production and diagnosis in
speech and health sciences. The motion is a consequence of air flow interacting
with elastic vocal fold structures. Motivated by existing lumped mass models
and known flow properties, we propose to model the continuous shape of vocal
fold in motion by the two dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations
coupled with an elastic damped driven wave equation on the fold cover. In this
paper, instead of pursuing a direct two dimensional numerical simulation, we
derive reduced quasi-one-dimensional model equations by averaging two
dimensional solutions along the flow cross sections. We then analyze the
oscillation modes of the linearized system about a flat fold, and found that
the fold motion goes through a Hopf bifurcation into temporal oscillation if
the flow energy is sufficient to overcome the damping in the fold consistent
with the early models. We also analyze the further reduced system under the
quasi-steady approximation and compare the resulting vocal fold equation in the
small vibration regime with that of the Titze model. Our model shares several
qualitative features with the Titze model yet differs in the specific form of
energy input from the air flow to the fold. Numerical issues and results of the
quasi-one-dimensional model system will be presented in part II (view resulting

their basic properties are reviewed. The general features of the Stokes
operators are illustrated by evaluation of their means and variances for a
range of simple polarization states. Some of the examples show polarization
squeezing, in which the variances of one or more Stokes parameters are smaller
than the coherent-state value. The main object of the paper is the application
of these concepts to bright squeezed light. It is shown that a light beam
formed by interference of two orthogonally-polarized quadrature-squeezed beams
exhibits squeezing in some of the Stokes parameters. Passage of such a primary
polarization-squeezed beam through suitable optical components generates a pair
of polarization-entangled light beams with the nature of a two-mode squeezed
state. The use of pairs of primary polarization-squeezed light beams leads to
substantially increased entanglement and to the generation of EPR-entangled
light beams. The important advantage of these nonclassical polarization states
for quantum communication is the possibility of experimentally determining all
of the relevant conjugate variables of both squeezed and entangled fields using
