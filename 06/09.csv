profiles in dark matter haloes. We assume that the gas density profile traces
the dark matter density profile in outer parts of the haloes, as suggested by
many hydrodynamic simulations. Under this assumption, the hydrostatic
equilibrium uniquely fixes the two free parameters in the model, the
mass-temperature normalization and the polytropic index, that determine the
temperature profile. This enables us to predict a universal gas profile from
any universal dark matter profile. Our results show that gas tracing dark
matter in the outer parts of the haloes is inconsistent with gas being
isothermal; on the contrary, it requires temperature to decrease slowly with
radius, in agreement with observations. We compare our predictions for X-ray
surface brightness profiles of the haloes and the mass-temperature relation
with observations. We find that they are generally in a good agreement. We
compare the universal profile with the beta profile and find that, although the
beta profile gives a reasonable fit to our predicted profiles, the deviation
from it can explain many of the observed trends, once we take into account the
observational selection effects. Our model predicts that the mass-temperature
relation does not follow the self-similar relation because of the
mass-dependent halo concentration. We also predict surface brightness profiles
of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. We find that fitted to the beta profile
the core radii and beta inferred from the SZ effect are systematically larger
than those from the X-ray measurement.

unprecedented resolution. This unique example allows to study the effect of low
resolution in previously published peak-flux distributions of radio spikes. We
give a general, analytical expression for how an actual peak-flux distribution
is changed in shape if the peaks are determined with low temporal and/or
frequency resolution. It turns out that, generally, low resolution tends to
cause an exponential behavior at large flux values if the actual distribution
is of power-law shape. The distribution may be severely altered if the
burst-duration depends on the peak-flux. The derived expression is applicable
also to peak-flux distributions derived at other wavelengths (e.g. soft and
hard X-rays, EUV). We show that for the analyzed spike-event the resolution was
sufficient for a reliable peak flux distribution. It can be fitted by
generalized power-laws or by an exponential.

population's birth rate, luminosity, shutoff of radio emission, birth

radio-selected, like most of the present EGRET/Comptel pulsars, and perhaps
even more that are detected via independent pulsation searches. At this
juncture, it is salient to outline the principal predictions of pulsar models
that might aid identification of gamma-ray sources, and moreover propel
subsequent interpretation of their properties. This review summarizes relevant
characteristics of the polar cap model, emphasizing where possible distinctions
from the competing outer gap model. Foremost among these considerations are the
hard X-ray to gamma-ray spectral shape, high energy cutoffs and pulse profiles,
and how these characteristics generally depend on pulsar period and period

exhibits definitive signatures that will be readily tested by the detections of

intermediate- and low-mass stars play an increasingly important role, while at
the same time, metal-rich Wolf-Rayet stars eject a significant amount of carbon
into the ISM by radiative-driven stellar winds. However, from the present
published nucleosynthesis yields we cannot distinguish whether the main source
of carbon in the late Galactic stage is just the massive stars ($M>8M_{\odot}$)
alone, or just the intermediate-, low-mass stars and $M\leq 40M_{\odot}$
massive stars that do not go through the Wolf-Rayet stage. The
$^{12}$C$(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}$O reaction rate is very important in the stellar
nucleosynthesis calculations: a lower rate will give a higher yield of carbon.
The contribution to nitrogen is dominated by intermediate- and low-mass stars,

metal-poor stars. Most of oxygen is produced by massive stars. The fact that a

very flat, indicating a less rigid vortex lattice, which would melt at a lower

wall motion in thin freestanding potassium niobate single-crystals. We observe
that not all domains of a given polarization orientation are equally switchable
in applied electric fields. Tilted and curved 90 degree domain walls are common
and display field-induced mobility, whereas untilted domain boundaries resist
such motion. The sensitivity of the domain wall response to field direction
suggests that electrostatic energy contributions play a crucial role in the
observed switching properties. We can explain our results in terms of the
polarization charges and the resulting depolarization fields associated with
angled domain walls. A phenomenological Landau-Ginzburg analysis of a tilted
domain boundary indicates that such electrostatic effects reduce its local
switching barrier, thereby enhancing its field-induced mobility compared to
that of its untilted counterpart. Consequently not all domain walls are equally
mobile. Furthermore the switching efficiency of a particular domain is
determined by its allowed final states, as defined by its neighbors. Switching
will be inhibited if the relative energetics are unfavorable, and we call this
phenomenon domain interlocking. Any increase in density of such field-resistant
wall configurations with cycle time represents an inherent contribution to
ferroelectric fatigue. Uniaxial ferroelectrics, with polarizations parallel to
the field, should not support such interlocked domains.

in $SINIS$ junctions where screened dipole layers at the $SN$ interfaces
generate a double-barrier multilayered $SIN$ structure. Our approach starts
from a microscopic Hamiltonian defined on a simple cubic lattice, with an
attractive Hubbard term accounting for the short coherence length
superconducting order in the semi-infinite leads, and a spatially extended
charge distribution (screened dipole layer) induced by the difference in Fermi
energies of the superconductor $S$ and the clean normal metal interlayer $N$.
By employing the temperature Green function technique, in a continued fraction
representation, the influence of such spatially inhomogeneous barriers on the
proximity effect, current-phase relation, critical supercurrent and normal
state junction resistance, is investigated for different normal interlayer
thicknesses and barrier heights. These results are of relevance for high-$T_c$
grain boundary junctions, and also reveal one of the mechanisms that can lead
to low critical currents of apparently ballistic $SNS$ junctions while
increasing its normal state resistance in a much weaker fashion. When the $N$
region is a doped semiconductor, we find a substantial change in the dipole
layer (generated by a small Fermi level mismatch) upon crossing the
superconducting critical temperature, which is a new signature of proximity
effect and might be related to recent Raman studies in Nb/InAs bilayers.

function that characterizes the state of the long-wavelength modes. This
function is obtained from the whole Wigner function by integration of the

the reduced Wigner function becomes a kind of Fokker-Planck equation which is
solved with suitable boundary conditions enforcing an initial metastable vacuum
state trapped in the potential well. As a result a finite activation rate is

  version(s)",,,,"math.LO quant-ph",,"  This paper surveys some recent developments towards a dynamic quantum logic
and outlines its explicite construction -- some analogies and contrasts with
other logics of dynamics are indicated. Abstract: The development of ``(static)
operational quantum logic"" points out that classical boolean structures are too
rigid to describe the actual and potential properties of quantum systems. On
the other hand, an intuitionistic perspective on operational quantum logic,
guides us in the direction of incorporating dynamics logically by reconsidering
the primitive propositions required to describe the behavior of a quantum
system, in particular in view of the emergent disjunctivity due to the
non-determinism of quantum measurements. A further elaboration on
""intuitionistic quantum logic"" emerges into a ""dynamic operational quantum
logic"", which allows us to express dynamic reasoning in the sense that we can
capture how actual properties propagate, including their temporal causal
structure, and provides a unified logical description of systems which evolve
or which are submitted to measurements. This setting reveals that even static
operational quantum logic bears a hidden dynamic ingredient in terms of what is
called ""the orthomodularity"" of the lattice-structure. Focusing on the quantale
semantics for dynamic operational quantum logic, we delineate some points of
difference with the existing quantale semantics for (non)-commutative linear
logic.

involves the projection postulate as a means of computing conditional and joint
probabilities. Although the method works well in linear quantum mechanics, it
completely fails for nonlinear evolutions. We propose an alternative way of
performing the same task in linear quantum mechanics and show that the method
smoothly extends to the nonlinear domain. The trick is to use appropriate
time-dependent Hamiltonians which involve ""switching-off functions"". We apply
the technique to the EPR problem in nonlinear quantum mechanics and show that

  clarifications",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The entanglement-assisted classical capacity of a noisy quantum channel is
the amount of information per channel use that can be sent over the channel in
the limit of many uses of the channel, assuming that the sender and receiver
have access to the resource of shared quantum entanglement, which may be used
up by the communication protocol. We show that this capacity is given by an
expression parallel to that for the capacity of a purely classical channel:
i.e., the maximum, over channel inputs $\rho$, of the entropy of the channel
input plus the entropy of the channel output minus their joint entropy, the
latter being defined as the entropy of an entangled purification of $\rho$
after half of it has passed through the channel. We calculate
entanglement-assisted capacities for two interesting quantum channels, the
qubit amplitude damping channel and the bosonic channel with
amplification/attenuation and Gaussian noise. We discuss how many independent
parameters are required to completely characterize the asymptotic behavior of a
general quantum channel, alone or in the presence of ancillary resources such
as prior entanglement. In the classical analog of entanglement assisted
communication--communication over a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) between
parties who share prior random information--we show that one parameter is
sufficient, i.e., that in the presence of prior shared random information, all
DMC's of equal capacity can simulate one another with unit asymptotic
efficiency.
