run into the event horizon problem, and thus be in conflict with the
superstring idea. In the other way around, the current accelerating phase as
well as the fate of the universe may be swayed by a negative cosmological
constant, which dictates a big crunch. Based on the current observational data,
in this paper we investigate how large the magnitude of a negative cosmological
constant is allowed to be. In addition, for distinguishing the sign of the
cosmological constant via observations, we point out that a measure of the
evolution of the dark energy equation of state may be a good discriminator.
Hopefully future observations will provide much more detailed information about
dark energy and thereby indicates the sign of the cosmological constant as well
as the fate of the presently accelerating universe.

in 10 of 11 sample galaxies, yielding HI masses of 0.3-4x10^9 M_odot, HI
linewidths, W_20, of 133-249 km/s, dynamical masses of 0.5-5x10^10 M_odot, gas
depletion timescales, tau_gas, of 0.3-7 Gyr, HI mass fractions of 0.01-0.58,

nearby HII galaxies, irregulars and spirals. Despite the restricted
morphological selection, our sample is quite heterogeneous in HI content,
dynamical mass, and gas depletion timescale. Therefore, these galaxies should
look very different from each other in 5 Gyr. Fading of intermediate-z luminous
blue compact galaxies into NGC-type spheroidals is a viable evolutionary
scenario for the least massive, most gas-poor objects. The most consistent
characteristic of our sample is that the ratio, R, of HII linewidth to HI 21 cm
linewidth (W_20) are systematically less than unity. The simplest explanation
is that the ionized gas is more centrally concentrated than the neutral gas
within the gravitational potential. On average R=0.66 +/- 0.16, similar to
findings for local HII galaxies. We find R is also a function of linewidth;
smaller linewidth galaxies have smaller values of R. Correcting optical
linewidths by this factor raises derived masses and places these galaxies on
the local luminosity--linewidth (Tully-Fisher) relation. If this ratio applies
to intermediate-redshift galaxies, then the proposed luminosity evolution of
the Tully-Fisher relation is much smaller and more gradual than suggested by
studies using optical emission-linewidth measurements.

Using an analytic model for the synchrotron, synchrotron-self-Compton, and

evolutionary scenario that links these blazar subclasses in terms of a
reduction of the black-hole accretion power with time. As the circumnuclear

scatter accretion-disk radiation and produce an external Compton-scattered

dK2 companion in a 12.5-hour orbit, is the prototype of the pre-cataclysmic
binaries. The late-type component is magnetically active, due to its being
constrained to rotate synchronously with the short orbital period. During a
program of UV spectroscopy of V471 Tau, carried out with the Goddard High
Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope, we
serendipitously detected two episodes in which transient absorptions in the Si
III 1206 A resonance line appeared suddenly, on a timescale of <2 min. The
observations were taken in a narrow spectral region around Ly-alpha, and were
all obtained near the two quadratures of the binary orbit, i.e., at maximum
projected separation (~3.3 Rsun) of the WD and K star.
  We suggest that these transient features arise when coronal mass ejections
(CME's) from the K2 dwarf pass across the line of sight to the WD. Estimates of
the velocities, densities, and masses of the events in V471 Tau are generally
consistent with the properties of solar CME's. Given our detection of 2 events
during 6.8 hr of GHRS observing, along with a consideration of the restricted
range of latitudes and longitudes on the K star's surface that can give rise to
trajectories passing in front of the WD as seen from Earth, we estimate that
the active V471 Tau dK star emits some 100-500 CME's per day, as compared to
1-3 per day for the Sun. The K dwarf's mass-loss rate associated with CME's is
at least (5-25) x 10^{-14} Msun/yr, but it may well be orders of magnitude
higher if most of the silicon is in ionization states other than Si III.

revealed that the rate of star formation in star-forming galaxies is
significantly suppressed with respect to their counterparts in the field at a
similar redshift. It is, however, highly uncertain which physical processes are
responsible for this suppression. We present the results of a numerical
investigation of how the global tidal field of a cluster dynamically influences
the reservoir of halo gas surrounding a disk galaxy as it falls into the
cluster from the surrounding field. We find that the tidal field of the cluster
efficiently removes the halo gas from the galaxy, thereby halting its accretion
onto the disk, and thus the fueling of star formation within. This effectively
truncates the galaxy's star formation. We also find that this tidal truncation
does not depend very strongly on the orbit of the disk with respect to the
center of the cluster.
  These results suggest that the global tidal field of clusters is capable of
causing a widespread and uniform suppression of star formation in galaxies
accreted by the cluster. In light of these results, we discuss the importance
of this tidal truncation of the gas supply in the formation of S0 galaxies in
clusters.

simulations on the dynamical evolution of nucleated dwarf galaxies orbiting NGC

plausible scaling relation for dwarf galaxies, we find that the outer stellar
components of a nucleated dwarf are totally removed. This is due to them being
tidally stripped over the course of several passages past the central region of
NGC 1399. The nucleus, however, manages to survive. We also find that the size
and luminosity of the remnant are similar to those observed for ultra-compact
dwarf galaxies, if the simulated precursor nucleated dwarf has a mass of $\sim$

way that younger stars have larger $A_V$ (originally referred to as selective
dust extinction by Poggianti & Wu 2000). In particular, we investigate how the
time evolution of the equivalent widths of [OII]$\lambda$3727 and H$\delta$ is
controlled by the adopted age dependence. This leads to three main results: (1)
If a young stellar population (with the age of $\sim$ $10^6$ yr) is more
heavily obscured by dust than an old one ($>$ $10^8$ yr), the galaxy can show
an ``e(a)'' spectrum characterized by strong H$\delta$ absorption and
relatively modest [OII] emission. (2) A dusty starburst galaxy with an e(a)
spectrum can evolve into a poststarburst galaxy with an a+k (or k+a) spectrum
0.2 Gyr after the starburst and then into a passive one with a k-type spectrum
1 Gyr after the starburst. This result clearly demonstrates an evolutionary
link between galaxies with different spectral classes (i.e., e(b), e(a), a+k,
k+a, and k). (3) A dusty starburst galaxy can show an a+k or k+a spectrum even
in the dusty starburst phase if the age-dependence of dust extinction is rather
weak, i.e., if young starburst populations with different ages ($\le$ $10^7$

sensitive to the equation of state but also to antikaon optical potential
depth. For large values of antikaon optical potential depth, $K^-$ condensation
sets in before the appearance of negatively charged hyperons. We treat $K^-$
condensation as a first order phase transition. The Gibbs criteria and global
charge conservation laws are used to describe the mixed phase. Nucleons and
$\Lambda$ hyperons behave dynamically in the mixed phase. A second order phase
transition to $\bar K^0$ condensation occurs in the pure $K^-$ condensed phase.
Along with $K^-$ condensation, $\bar K^0$ condensation makes the equation of
state softer thus resulting in smaller maximum mass stars compared with the

progenitors. Moreover, there is mounting evidence that a new $r$-process site
may be required. Hence, we assume that a prompt explosion can occur and make a
study of r-process nucleosynthesis in the supernova ejecta. To achieve a prompt
explosion we have performed a general relativistic hydrodynamic simulation of
adiabatic collapse and bounce using a relativistic nuclear-matter equation of
state. The electron fraction $Y_e$ during the collapse was fixed at the
initial-model value. The size of the inner collapsing core was then large
enough to enable a prompt explosion to occur. Adopting the calculated
trajectories of promptly ejected material, we explicitly computed the burst of
neutronization due to electron captures on free protons in the photodissociated
ejecta after the passage of the shock. The thermal and compositional evolution
of the resulting neutron-rich ejecta originating from near the surface of
proto-neutron star was obtained. These were used in nuclear reaction network
calculations to evaluate the products of $r$-process nucleosynthesis. We find
that, unlike earlier studies, the amount of $r$-process material ejected per
supernova is quite consistent with observed galactic $r$-process abundances.
Furthermore, the computed $r$-process abundances are in good agreement with
Solar abundances of $r$-process elements for A$> 100$. This suggests that
prompt supernovae are still a viable $r$-process site. Such events may be
responsible for the abundances of the heaviest $r$-process nuclei.

Astrophys., 375 (2001) 469","10.1051/0004-6361:20010880",,"astro-ph",,"  Frequency analysis of more than 300 stars of the OGLE database on Sculptor
galaxy has led to the discovery of 18 double-mode RR Lyrae (RRd) variables.
This yields a 20% incidence rate for double-mode pulsation among the variables
previously classified as first overtone RR Lyrae stars in this galaxy. Most of
the RRd stars cover the period range of 0.47d < P_0 < 0.49d but there are two
stars with longer periods of ~0.54d. All variables fit well in the pattern of
the P_0 --> P_1/P_0 diagram, spanned by the RRd stars of the Galactic globular
clusters and those of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). It follows from our
previous investigations that the luminosities and masses of the RRd stars in
Galactic globular clusters and in the LMC are almost independent of
metallicity. By assuming that the Sculptor RRd variables also obey this rule,
with the aid of the pulsation equations we estimate their metallicities. For
most of the stars we get [Fe/H]~ -1.5, which is the same value as that obtained
from a semi-empirical method for the average metallicity of the fundamental
mode (RRab) stars. Two RRd stars have considerably lower metallicities, but
even those are within the range corresponding to the RRab stars. The narrower
metallicity range of the RRd stars is in agreement with their observed
luminosity range, which is about three times smaller than that of the RRab
stars.

stabilization of the long-range order in chirality (staggered chirality). We

We begin by deriving general formulas for the first order variation in ADM mass

background in terms of the perturbed non-electromagnetic stress-energy, $\delta
T_{ab}$, and the perturbed charge current density, $\delta j^a$. Using these

stationary black holes. We then investigate the generalized second law of
thermodynamics (GSL) for charged, stationary black holes for processes in which
a box containing charged matter is lowered toward the black hole and then
released (at which point the box and its contents fall into the black hole
and/or thermalize with the ``thermal atmosphere'' surrounding the black hole).
Assuming that the thermal atmosphere admits a local, thermodynamic description
with respect to observers following orbits of the horizon Killing field, and
assuming that the combined black hole/thermal atmosphere system is in a state
of maximum entropy at fixed mass, angular momentum, and charge, we show that
the total generalized entropy cannot decrease during the lowering process or in
the ``release process''. Consequently, the GSL always holds in such processes.
No entropy bounds on matter are assumed to hold in any of our arguments.

We first show that the present SNO response function is very similar to the

basis of such equivalence we confirm, in a completely model-independent way,
the SNO evidence for an active, non-electron neutrino component in the SK event
sample, with a significance greater than 3 sigma. Then, by assuming no
oscillations into sterile neutrinos, we combine the SK+SNO data to derive
allowed regions for two free parameters: (i) the ratio f_B of the true B \nu
flux from the Sun to the corresponding value predicted by the standard solar
model (SSM), and (ii) the \nu_e survival probability <Pee>, averaged over the
common SK and SNO response function. We obtain the separate 3sigma ranges:
f_B=1.03^{+0.50}_{-0.58} (in agreement with the SSM central value, f_B=1) and
<Pee> =0.34^{+0.61}_{-0.18} (in >3sigma disagreement with the standard

oscillation parameters (\delta m^2,\tan^2\omega) including all the solar \nu

in the gluon saturation environment which suppresses large size instantons. The
effective cutoff scale is determined by the inverse of the saturation scale. We
concentrate on two most important cases: the small-x tail of a gluon
distribution of a high energy hadron or a large nucleus and the central
rapidity region in a high energy hadronic or heavy ion collision. In the
saturation regime the gluon density in a single large ultrarelativistic nucleus
is high and gluonic fields are given by the classical solutions of the
equations of motion. We show that these strong classical fields do not affect
the density of instantons in the nuclear wave function compared to the
instanton density in the vacuum. A classical solution with non-trivial
topological charge is found for the gluon field of a single nucleus at the
lowest order in the instanton perturbation theory. In the case of
ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions a strong classical gluonic field is
produced in the central rapidity region. We demonstrate that this field
introduces a suppression factor of exp{-c \rho^4 Q_s^4 / [8 \alpha^2 N_c (Q_s
\tau)^2]} in the instanton size distribution, where Q_s is the saturation scale
of both (identical) nuclei, \tau is the proper time and c = 1 is the gluon
liberation coefficient. This factor suggests that gluonic saturation effects at
the early stages of nuclear collisions regulate the instanton size distribution
in the infrared region and make the instanton density finite by suppressing
large size instantons.

they allow for precisely two values of the radius of the relevant sphere, and
that the solution with the smaller value of the radius has the lower energy.
Moreover, the possible radii in both cases agree up to numerical factors with

that these supergravity solutions are the correct gravitational description of

  Computations in Finite Ring Domains","9 pages, 8 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.64.046212",,"nlin.PS",,"  We investigate the instabilities and bifurcations of traveling pulses in a
model excitable medium; in particular we discuss three different scenarios for
the loss of stability resp. the disappearance of stable pulses. In numerical
simulations beyond the instabilities we observe replication of pulses
(backfiring) resulting in complex periodic or spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics
as well as modulated traveling pulses. We approximate the linear stability of
traveling pulses through computations in a finite albeit large domain with
periodic boundary conditions. The critical eigenmodes at the onset of the
instabilities are related to the resulting spatiotemporal dynamics and act upon
the back of the pulses. The first scenario has been analyzed earlier for high
excitability resp. low excitation threshold: it involves the collision of a
stable pulse branch with an unstable pulse branch in a so called T-point.

periodically exploding Strombolian-type volcanos. These patterns include major
events (explosions) which follow each other every 10-30 minutes and subsequent
tremor with a typical period of 1 second. This two-periodic activity is thought
to be caused by two distinct mechanisms of accumulation of the elastic energy
in the moving magma column: compressibility of the magma in the lower conduit
and viscoelastic response of the almost solid magma plug on the top. A release
of the elastic energy happens when a stick-slip dynamic phase transition in a
boundary layer along the walls of the conduit occurs; this phase transition is
driven by the shear stress accumulated in the boundary layer. The first-order
character and intrinsic hysteresis of this phase transition explains the long
periods of inactivity in the explosion cycle. Temporal characteristics of the
model are found to be qualitatively similar to the acoustic and seismic signals
recorded at Karymsky volcano in Kamchatka.

process in two cascaded crystals. The optical axes of the crystals are aligned
in such a way that the extraordinarily (ordinarily) polarized cone from one

second crystal. This spatial overlapping removes the association between the
polarization and the output angle of the photons that exist in a single type-II

This delay line is particularly simple and easy to implement.
