binary, II Pegasi (HD 224085), covering the wavelength range of 1.5-25
Angstroms. For the first half of our 44 ksec observation, the source was in a
quiescent state with constant X-ray flux, after which it flared, reaching twice
the quiescent flux in 12 ksec, then decreasing. We analyze the emission-line
spectrum and continuum during quiescent and flaring states. The differential
emission measure derived from lines fluxes shows a hot corona with a continuous
distribution in temperature. During the non-flare state, the distribution peaks
near log T = 7.2, and when flaring, near 7.6. High-temperature lines are
enhanced slightly during the flare, but most of the change occurs in the
continuum. Coronal abundance anomalies are apparent, with iron very deficient
relative to oxygen and significantly weaker than expected from photospheric
measurements, while neon is enhanced relative to oxygen. We find no evidence of
appreciable resonant scattering optical depth in line ratios of iron and
oxygen. The flare light curve is consistent with Solar two-ribbon flare models,
but with a very long reconnection time-constant of about 65 ks. We infer loop
lengths of about 0.05 stellar radii, to about 0.25 in the flare, if the flare
emission originated from a single, low-density loop.

that significant angular momentum with associated velocities of a few x 10^{3}
km/s can be imparted to the resulting cluster. Such gas bulk velocities can be
detected by the Doppler shift of X-ray spectral lines with ASCA spectrometers.
Using two ASCA observations of the Centaurus cluster, we produced a velocity
map for the gas in the cluster's central regions. We also detected radial and
azimuthal gradients in temperature and metal abundance distributions, which
seem to be associated with the infalling sub-group centered at NGC 4709 (Cen
45). More importantly, we found a significant (>99.8% confidence level)
velocity gradient along a line near-perpendicular to the direction of the
incoming sub-group and with a maximum velocity difference of ~3.4+-1.1 x 10^{3}
km/s. It is unlikely (P < 0.002) that the observed velocity gradient is
generated by gain fluctuations across the detectors. While the observed
azimuthal temperature and abundance variations can be attributed to the
interaction with Cen 45, we argue that the intracluster gas velocity gradient
is more likely due to a previous off-center merging event in the main body of
the Centaurus cluster.

emergent phenomenon, one that is not ``fundamental'' but rather is an almost
automatic low-energy long-distance consequence of a wide class of theories.
Specifically, the emergence of a curved spacetime ``effective Lorentzian
geometry'' is a common generic result of linearizing a classical scalar field
theory around some non-trivial background. This explains why so many different
``analog models'' of general relativity have recently been developed based on
condensed matter physics; there is something more fundamental going on. Upon
quantizing the linearized fluctuations around this background geometry, the
one-loop effective action is guaranteed to contain a term proportional to the
Einstein--Hilbert action of general relativity, suggesting that while classical
physics is responsible for generating an ``effective geometry'', quantum
physics can be argued to induce an ``effective dynamics''. This physical
picture suggests that Einstein gravity is an emergent low-energy long-distance
phenomenon that is insensitive to the details of the high-energy short-distance
physics.

The issue is subtle for two reasons: there is a discontinuity in the mass in
the lowest tree-level approximation, and, moreover, the nonlinear
four-dimensional theory of a massive graviton is not defined unambiguously.
First, we reiterate the old argument that for the vanishing graviton mass the
lowest tree-level approximation breaks down since the higher order corrections
are singular in the graviton mass. However, there exist nonperturbative
solutions which correspond to the summation of the singular terms and these
solutions are continuous in the graviton mass. Furthermore, we study a
completely nonlinear and generally covariant five-dimensional model which
mimics the properties of the four-dimensional theory of massive gravity. We
show that the exact solutions of the model are continuous in the mass, yet the
perturbative expansion exhibits the discontinuity in the leading order and the
singularities in higher orders as in the four-dimensional case. Based on exact
cosmological solutions of the model we argue that the helicity-zero graviton
state which is responsible for the perturbative discontinuity decouples from
the matter in the limit of vanishing graviton mass in the full classical
theory.

distributions and wavefunctions for the Chern-Simons matrix model proposed by
Polychronakos and compare them to the Laughlin ones. We analyze two different
coherent state representations, corresponding to different choices for electron
coordinate bases. In both cases we find that the resulting probability
distributions do not quite agree with the Laughlin ones. There is agreement on
the long distance behavior, but the short distance behavior is different.

functions play this role in a 2+1 dimensional model in which the non

function in this non commutative geometry is suggested. We also analyze higher

The shorter-range corrections induced by the continuum of massive scalar modes

response as a function of the energy and the identity of the ion is proposed.
It depends on four parameters. For three of them, connected to CsI(Tl)
intrinsic characteristics, recommended fixed values are proposed. They are
issued from the comparative study of the forward scintillators of INDRA, based
on intermediate mass fragment data. The fourth one, related to light collection
and to the gain of the associated photomultiplier, is particular and may be
accurately obtained afterwards, from light charged particle data. Two
applications are presented: fragment identification in telescopes using a
CsI(Tl) crystal as residual energy detector and the scintillator energy
calibration. The results are successfully confronted to heavy fragment
experimental data.

high density Helium gas in extended ranges of temperature $[(26\leq T\leq 77) K
]$ and density $[ (0.05\leq N\leq 12.0) {atoms} \cdot {nm}^{-3}]$ to ascertain
the effect of temperature on the formation and dynamics of localized electron
states. The main result of the experiment is that the formation of localized
states essentially depends on the relative balance of fluid dilation energy,
repulsive electron-atom interaction energy, and thermal energy. As a
consequence, the onset of localization depends on the medium disorder through
gas temperature and density. It appears that the transition from delocalized to
localized states shifts to larger densities as the temperature is increased.
This behavior can be understood in terms of a simple model of electron
self-trapping in a spherically symmetric square well.
