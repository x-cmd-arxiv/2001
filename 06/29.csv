in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) where the instrument scans on rings
which can be combined into an n-torus, the {\em ring torus}. This class has the
remarkable property that it allows exact maximum likelihood power spectrum
estimation in of order $N^2$ operations (if the size of the data set is $N$)
under circumstances which would previously have made this analysis intractable:
correlated receiver noise, arbitrary asymmetric beam shapes and far side lobes,
non-uniform distribution of integration time on the sky and partial sky
coverage. This ease of computation gives us an important theoretical tool for
understanding the impact of instrumental effects on CMB observables and hence
for the design and analysis of the CMB observations of the future. There are
members of this class which closely approximate the MAP and Planck satellite
missions. We present a numerical example where we apply our ring torus methods
to a simulated data set from a CMB mission covering a 20 degree patch on the
sky to compute the maximum likelihood estimate of the power spectrum $C_\ell$
with unprecedented efficiency.

explained by the interaction of the accelerated-baryonic-matter pulse with

previously established members of stellar kinematic groups based on photometric
and kinematic properties as well as from candidates based on other criteria as
their level of chromospheric activity, rotation rate, lithium abundance.
Precise measurements of proper motions and parallaxes taken from Hipparcos

measurements are used to calculate the Galactic space motions (U, V, W) and to
apply the Eggen's kinematic criteria in order to determine the membership of
the selected stars to the different groups. Additional criteria using
age-dating methods for late-type stars will be applied in forthcoming papers of
this series. A further study of the list of stars compiled here could lead to a
better understanding of the chromospheric activity and their age evolution as
well as of the star formation history in the solar neighbourhood. In addition,
these stars are also potential search targets for direct imaging detection of
sub-stellar companions.

SN shell accumulates the mass of the cloud. This is accompanied by
fragmentation resulting in star formation in the shell. If this stellar shell
expands sufficiently slow, its self-gravity leads to a recollapsing shell, by
this forming one or several stellar clusters.

virialised conditions yield ~5% of triple mergers in ~10 Gyr of evolution;
hence, the 3-galaxy problem has stable states. No overmerging problem for these
small groups of galaxies is found. Their geometrical properties, as reflected
by the Agekyan-Anosova map, do not show an excess of extreme hierarchical
triplets. The median velocity dispersion of observed compact triplets (~100
km/s) is not well reproduced in our models at the present epoch. However, about
10% of simulated triplets starting from maximum expansion have dynamical
properties very similar to them. Our median values agree, however, very well
with new data on triples. We find that the median mass estimators performs

important to devise self consistency tests of cosmogonic theories tuned at the
matter radiation decoupling epoch using data from the non--linear evolved

``tilted'' CDM model and a $\Lambda$CDM model with cosmic density parameter
$\Omega_m=0.35$ and cosmological constant contribution $\Omega_\Lambda=0.65$.
  From the projected mass distribution of the clusters we work out the

their \lcdm counterpart. The effect is mass dependent: massive clusters
($M\gsim 10^{15}\Msunh$) have quadrupoles differing by more than 30% in the two

several hundred clusters with masses above the threshold for which the

in its inner regions (observed with the Hubble Space Telescope) than in the
cluster outskirts (observed from the ground), i.e., M3 has an internal second
parameter. Most plausibly the mass loss on the red giant branch (RGB) has been
more efficient in the inner than in the outer regions of the cluster. ii) The
dispersion in mass of the Pal 3 HB is found to be very small -- consistent with
zero -- and we argue that this is unlikely to be due to a statistical
fluctuation. It is this small mass dispersion that leads to the most apparent
difference in the HB morphologies of M3 and Pal 3. iii) The relative HB types
of M3 and Pal 3, as measured by mean colors or parameters involving the number
of blue, variable, and red HB stars, can easily be accounted for by a fairly
small difference in age between these clusters, of order 0.5-1 Gyr -- which is
in good agreement with the relative age measurement, based on the clusters'

ion in the interstellar medium of the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. Along
sightlines to OB-type stars, these interstellar components are usually blended
with O VI stellar wind profiles, which frequently vary in shape. In order to
assess the effects of this time-dependent blending on measurements of the
interstellar O VI lines, we have undertaken a mini-survey of repeated
observations toward OB-type stars in the Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud.
These sparse time series, which consist of 2-3 observations separated by
intervals ranging from a few days to several months, show that wind variability
occurs commonly in O VI (about 60% of a sample of 50 stars), as indeed it does
in other resonance lines. However, in the interstellar O VI $\lambda$1032
region, the O VI $\lambda$1038 wind varies only in $\sim$30% of the cases. By
examining cases exhibiting large amplitude variations, we conclude that
stellar-wind variability {\em generally} introduces negligible uncertainty for
single interstellar O VI components along Galactic lines of sight, but can
result in substantial errors in measurements of broader components or blends of
components like those typically observed toward stars in the Large Magellanic
Cloud. Due to possible contamination by discrete absorption components in the
stellar O VI line, stars with terminal velocities greater than or equal to the
doublet separation (1654 km/s) should be treated with care.

the cases where the resistivity is larger. The latter ones show signs typical
of dynamo action based on the usual helicity effect. In the idealized

be particularly strong. In both cases there is, as expected, a systematic flux
of magnetic helicity through the midplane. However, very little helicity flux
leaves the domain through the top and bottom boundaries. The idealized

publication of extensive data by the group in Heidelberg. The corresponding
calculations have now been completed for the energetically lowest five states

calculations have been performed for even higher excitations. In strongly
magnetized white dwarfs only line components are visible whose wavelengths vary
slowly with respect to the magnetic field, particularly stationary components
which have a wavelength minimum or maximum in the range of the magnetic fields
strengths on the stellar surface. In view of the many ongoing surveys finding
white dwarfs we want to provide the astronomical community with a tool to
identify helium in white dwarfs for fields up to 5.3GG. To this end we present
all calculated helium line components whose wavelengths in the UV, optical, and
near IR vary slowly enough with respect to the field strength to produce
visible absorption features. We also list all stationary line components in

  Journal","Astron.J.122:1084-1103,2001","10.1086/322134",,"astro-ph",,"  We review a sample of the early literature in which the reality of the
expansion is discussed, explain Hubble's reticence to accept the expansion as
real, and contrast the Tolman surface brightness test with three other modern
tests. We search for the Tolman surface brightness depression with redshift
using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data from Paper III for 34 early-type
galaxies from the three clusters Cl 1324+3011 (z=0.76), Cl 1604+4304 (z=0.90),
and Cl 1604+4321 (z=0.92). Depressions of the surface brightness relative to
the zero-redshift fiducial lines in the mean surface brightness, log linear
radius diagrams of Paper I are found for all three clusters. Expressed as the
exponent, n, in 2.5 log (1 + z)^n mag, the value of n for all three clusters is
n = 2.59 +/- 0.17 in the R band and 3.37 +/- 0.13 in the I band for a q_o = 1/2
model. The sensitivity of the result to the assumed value of q_o is shown to be
less than 23% between q_o = 0 and +1. For a true Tolman signal with n = 4, the
luminosity evolution in the look-back time, expressed as the exponent in 2.5
log (1+z)^(4-n) mag, must then be between 1.72 to 1.19 in the R band and 0.94
to 0.45 in the I band. We show that this is precisely the range expected from
the evolutionary models of Bruzual & Charlot. We conclude that the Tolman
surface brightness test is consistent with the reality of the expansion. We
have also used the high-redshift HST data to test the ``tired light''
speculation for a non-expansion model for the redshift. The HST data rule out
the ``tired light'' model at a significance level of better than 10 sigma.

years after the outburst. The x-ray spectrum is soft, as would be expected if
the x-ray emission is due to the interaction of supernova ejecta with
circumstellar matter. Most of the other sources are variable either within the
Chandra observation or when compared to archival data. None are coincident with
the peak of the radio emission at the nucleus. These sources have harder
spectra than the supernova and are likely x-ray binaries. M100 has more bright
x-ray sources than typical for spiral galaxies of its size. This is likely
related to active star formation occurring in the galaxy.

of non-homogeneous funneling potentials, is considered. We first study the
mean-first passage time (MFPT) for diffusion in a linear potential with
different types of correlated and uncorrelated random perturbations. Increasing
the funneling force, there is a transition from a phase in which the MFPT grows
exponentially with the number of generations $g$, to one in which it does so
linearly. Overall the disorder slows down the diffusion, but the effect is much
more pronounced in the exponential compared to the linear phase. When the
disorder gives rise to uncorrelated random forces there is, in addition, a
transition as the temperature $T$ is lowered. This is a transition from a
high-$T$ regime in which all paths contribute to the MFPT to a low-$T$ regime
in which only a few of them do. We further explore the funneling within a
realistic non-linear potential for extended dendrimers in which the dependence
of the lowest excitonic energy level on the segment length was derived using
the Time-Dependent Hatree-Fock approximation. Under this potential the MFPT
grows initially linearly with $g$ but crosses-over, beyond a molecular-specific
and $T$-dependent optimal size, to an exponential increase. Finally we consider
geometrical disorder in the form of a small concentration of long connections
as in the {\it small world} model. Beyond a critical concentration of
connections the MFPT decreases significantly and it changes to a power-law or
to a logarithmic scaling with $g$, depending on the strength of the funneling
force.

solved exactly. In this review, we discuss a variety of analytical and
numerical methods, which treat the system in a systematic and controlled

renormalization group (DMRG) method. This is supported by small scale numerical
exact calculations, and by analytical methods using field theoretic techniques.

dense vortex tangles respectively, whose dynamics is calculated by the
Biot-Savart law. In the case of a dense tangle, the slope of the energy
spectrum is changed at $k=2\pi/l$, where $l$ is the intervortex spacing. For
$k>2\pi/l$, the energy spectrum has $k^{-1}$ behavior in the same manner as the
dilute vortex tangle, while otherwise the slope of the energy spectrum deviates
from $k^{-1}$ behavior. We compare the behavior for $k<2\pi/l$ with the
Kolmogorov law.

the other one quasi-free. To solve this extended Hubbard model, we apply simple
approximations, namely SDA and MAA, that, concerning ferromagnetism in the

approach allows us to discuss the underlying mechanism, by which d-band
ferromagnetism is influenced by the hybridization on the basis of analytical
expressions. The latter clearly display the order and the functional
dependencies of the important effects. It is found, that spin-dependent
inter-band particle fluctuations cause a spin-dependent band shift and a
spin-dependent band broadening of the Hubbard bands. The shift stabilizes, the
broadening tends to destabilize ferromagnetism. Stabilization requires
relatively high band distances and small hybridization matrix elements.

of inertia tensor. The angular amplitude of the free precession is limited by
the finite breaking strain of the star's crust. The effect of internal
dissipation on the star is important, with the precession angle being rapidly
damped in the case of a star with an oblate deformation. We then go on to study
detailed scenarios where free precession is created and/or maintained by some
astrophysical mechanism. We consider the effects of accretion torques,
electromagnetic torques, glitches and stellar encounters. We find that the
mechanisms considered are either too weak to lead to a signal detectable by an
Advanced LIGO interferometer, or occur too infrequently to give a reasonable
event rate. We therefore conclude that, using our stellar model at least, free
precession is not a good candidate for detection by the forthcoming laser
interferometers.

cross such a surface many times, but we show that first and last crossings are

quantized (using the Klein-Gordon equation, or its square root, with the
associated Newton-Wigner states). In the Klein-Gordon quantization, the

central feature of many modern field theories. Usually, one starts with a
Lagrangian for some scalar or spinor matter fields, with the Lagrangian being
invariant under a global phase symmetry transformation of the matter fields.
Making this global phase symmetry local results in the introduction of vector
fields. The vector fields can be said to arise as a result of the gauge
principle. Here we show that this chain of reasoning can be reversed: by
gauging the electric-magnetic dual symmetry of a Lagrangian which originally
contains only the vector gauge fields we find that it is necessary to introduce
matter fields (scalar fields in our example). In this gauging of the
electric-magnetic dual symmetry the traditional roles of the vector fields and

ordinary nuclear densities, when chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, the
scalar susceptibility is distinct from the pseudoscalar one, which is linked to
the fluctuations of the quark pseudoscalar density. We show that the
pseudoscalar one, which is large in the vacuum, owing to the smallness of the
pion mass, follows the density evolution of the quark condensate and thus
decreases. The scalar one instead increases due to the mixing with the softer
modes of the nucleon-hole excitations. At normal nuclear matter density the two
susceptibilities become much closer, a partial chiral symmetry restoration
effect as they become equal when the full restoration is achieved.

complementary to lab bench measurements of RF cavities, in that the beam based
measurements directly sense the physical impedance in the installed

these techniques resolve the impedances in the frequency domain. These methods
allow determination of the impedance's unaliased frequency by analyzing
synchronous phase transients. Experimental results from ALS and BESSY-II are
presented showing the use of these techniques to measure complex impedances.

First we generalize a method for proving classical communication complexity

an exponential separation between bounded error quantum communication
complexity and nondeterministic quantum communication complexity. We develop
several other lower bound methods based on the Fourier transform, notably
showing that \sqrt{\bar{s}(f)/\log n}, for the average sensitivity \bar{s}(f)
of a function f, yields a lower bound on the bounded error quantum
communication complexity of f(x AND y XOR z), where x is a Boolean word held by
Alice and y,z are Boolean words held by Bob. We then prove the first large
lower bounds on the bounded error quantum communication complexity of

functions we investigate, the only previously applied general lower bound
method based on discrepancy yields bounds that are O(\log n).
