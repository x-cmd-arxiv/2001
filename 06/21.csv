densities for 104 galaxies selected from the IRAS Bright Galaxy Sample and we
found that the 60, 100 micron (IRAS) and 850 micron (SCUBA) fluxes could be
adequately fitted by emission from dust at a single temperature. In this paper
we present 450 micron data for the galaxies. With the new data, the spectral
energy distributions of the galaxies can no longer be fitted with an isothermal
dust model - two temperature components are now required. Using our 450 micron
data and fluxes from the literature, we find that the 450/850 micron flux ratio
for the galaxies is remarkably constant and this holds from objects in which
the star formation rate is similar to our own Galaxy, to ultraluminous infrared
galaxies (ULIRGS) such as Arp 220. The only possible explanation for this is if
the dust emissivity index for all of the galaxies is ~2 and the cold dust
component has a similar temperature in all galaxies (20-21 K). The dust masses
estimated using the new temperatures are higher by a factor ~2 than those
determined previously using a single temperature. This brings the gas-to-dust
ratios of the IRAS galaxies into agreement with those of the Milky Way and
other spiral galaxies which have been intensively studied in the submm.

be determined at least in part by the primordial tidal gravitational field in
which the galaxy formed. Long-range correlations in the tidal field could thus
lead to an ellipticity-ellipticity correlation for widely separated galaxies.
We present a new model relating ellipticity to angular momentum, which can be
calculated in linear theory. We use this model to calculate the angular power
spectrum of intrinsic galaxy shape correlations. We show that for low redshift
galaxy surveys, our model predicts that intrinsic correlations will dominate
correlations induced by weak lensing, in good agreement with previous
theoretical work and observations. We find that our model produces `E-mode'
correlations enhanced by a factor of 3.5 over B-modes on small scales, making
it harder to disentangle intrinsic correlations from those induced by weak

synthetic-spectrum code SYNOW are compared to photospheric-phase spectra of

simplifying approximations, including spherical symmetry, they account well for
the observed spectra. Our sample of SNe Ib obeys a tight relation between the
velocity at the photosphere, as determined from the Fe II features, and the
time relative to that of maximum light. From this we infer that the masses and
the kinetic energies of the events in this sample were similar. After maximum
light the minimum velocity at which the He I features form usually is higher
than the velocity at the photosphere, but the minimum velocity of the ejected
helium is at least as low as 7000 kms. Previously unpublished spectra of SN
2000H reveal the presence of hydrogen absorption features, and we conclude that
hydrogen lines also were present in SNe 1999di and 1954A. Hydrogen appears to
be present in SNe Ib in general, although in most events it becomes too weak to
identify soon after maximum light. The hydrogen-line optical depths that we use
to fit the spectra of SNe 2000H, 1999di, and 1954A are not high, so only a mild
reduction in the hydrogen optical depths would be required to make these events
look like typical SNe Ib. Similarly, the He I line optical depths are not very
high, so a moderate reduction would make SNe Ib look like SNe Ic.

radiation by mildly relativistic electrons trapped in a hot and dense coronal
loop above electron cyclotron maser emission. This leads to densities and
magnetic field strengths in the radio source of n ~ 2x10^11 cm^-3 and B ~ 800

star formation among the dwarf galaxies than suggested by morphological

transform late-type dwarfs to early-type dwarfs. The fraction of dwarfs with

spectroscopic observations of the little-studied dwarf nova FS Aur in
quiescence. The spectrum of FS Aur shows strong and broad emission lines of
hydrogen and HeI, and of weaker HeII 4686 and CIII/NIII blend, similar to other
quiescent dwarf novae. All emission lines are single-peaked, however their form
varies with orbital phase. Absorption lines from a late-type secondary are not
detected. From the radial velocity measurements of the hydrogen lines H$_\beta$
and H$_\gamma$ we determined a most probable orbital period P=0.059+-0.002.
This period agrees well with the 0.0595+-0.0001 estimate by Thorstensen et al.
(1996). On the other hand, the period of photometric modulations is longer than
the spectroscopic period and can be estimated as 3 hours. Longer time coverage
during a single night is needed to resolve this problem. Using the
semi-amplitude of the radial velocities, obtained from measurements of hydrogen
and helium lines, and some empirical and theoretical relations we limited the
basic parameters of the system: a mass ratio q>=0.22, a primary mass M_1=0.34 -
0.46 M_sun, a secondary mass M_2<= 0.1M_sun, and an inclination angle
i=51^{\circ} - 65^{\circ}. Doppler tomography has shown at least two bright
regions in the accretion disk of FS Aur. The first, brighter spot is located at
phase about 0.6. The second spot is located opposite the first one and occupies
an extensive area at phases about 0.85 - 1.15.

circumnuclear HII regions do not vary strongly with the morphological type of
the host galaxy, nor does the number of circumnuclear HII regions per unit
area. The H alpha luminosity within the central kpc, as derived from HII region
emission, is significantly enhanced in early-type (S0/a-Sb) galaxies. We find
evidence that bars increase the circumnuclear star formation, presumably by
funneling gas from the disk towards the nucleus. Barred galaxies exhibit
enhanced luminosities of the brightest HII region, the central kpc H alpha
luminosities (an effect mostly due to the early type galaxies in our sample),
and the star formation rates per unit stellar mass (which could also be
understood as the integral equivalent widths of Pa alpha) over the central kpc
with respect to non-barred galaxies.
  We fit the luminosity functions and diameter distributions of the
circumnuclear HII regions in 8 galaxies where we can catalog enough HII regions
to do so in a meaningful way. We use power laws and find that the fitted slopes
of the HII region LF are exactly in the previously found ranges, and even
confirm a trend with steeper slopes in galaxies of earlier morphological type.
This implies that the physical processes giving rise to enhanced star formation
in the circumnuclear regions of galaxies must be similar to those in disks.

and taking the quasiclassical limit, one obtains a complete set of conserved
quantities, H_i, from which the DBCS Hamiltonian can be constructed as a second

the Gaudin Hamiltonians in the limit of infinitely strong coupling) are exactly
known in terms of a set of parameters determined by a set of on-shell Bethe
Ansatz equations, which reproduce Richardson's equations for these parameters.
We thus clarify that the integrability of the DBCS model is a special case of
the integrability of the twisted inhomogeneous XXX vertex model. Furthermore,
by considering the twisted inhomogeneous XXZ model and/or choosing a generic
polynomial of the H_i as Hamiltonian, more general exactly solvable models can
be constructed. -- To make the paper accessible to readers that are not Bethe

simplified version of the Brownian ratchet, when its motion is limited by the
bacterium movement, is proposed and analyzed stochastically. Analytical results
for the simple model are obtained and statistical data analysis is
investigated. The MSD of the stochastic bacterium movement is a quadratic
function while the MSD for the detrended trajectory is shown to be linear. The

of magnetic particles of which the ferrofluid is composed. Both these gradients
cause a spatial variation in magnetization, which induces a gradient of
magnetic field intensity within the fluid layer. The field gradient induces in
its turn an additional redistribution of magnetic grains due to
magnetophoresis. Resulting self-consistent magnetic force tries to mix the
fluid. A linear stability analysis predicts oscillatory instability in a
certain region of the magnetic field strength and the fluid parameters. The
instability owes magneto- and thermophoresis its origin: were the particle
diffusion not operative, then only stationary instability would occur. A

value of the correlation length for the spin-pair correlation function than a

the correlation length $\xi$ is about 204 times of the lattice constant for

the wave function, the quantum version of the --linear in momenta-- classical
integrals of motion (conditional symmetries). The vector fields inferred from
these integrals induce, through their integral curves, motions in the
configuration space which can be identified to the action of the automorphism
group of Type I, i.e. $GL(3,\Re)$. Thus, a wave function depending on one
degree of freedom, namely the determinant of the scale factor matrix, is found.
A measure for constructing the Hilbert space is proposed. This measure respects
the above mentioned symmetries, and is also invariant under the classical
property of covariance under arbitrary scalings of the Hamiltonian (quadratic

the ratio between |v| and the dynamically generated scale Lambda. At large

densely distributed in rings of calculable thicknesses in the v-plane. At small

1/(2N). These fractional instantons give non-trivial contributions to all

contracted in the even p case, or of two pairs of (q+1)-form fields with q
indices of each pair of fields contracted in the odd p case, where the
(q+1)-form fields are of external derivatives of one auxiliary q-form field for
the former, or a pair of auxiliary q-form fields for the latter. Using this
action, it is straightforward to deduce the recently constructed PST action for

error in the measurement (equivalent to an introduction of 0.6% x-y coupling
error), or the effect of intrabeam scattering is stronger than predicted (35%
stronger in growth rates).

opportunity to directly detect the primary scintillation light produced in
these media by photons or particles. This signal can be used for several
purposes, for example as a start signal for TPCs or for particles
identification. Usually photomultipliers (PMs) are used for the detection of
the scintillation light. In our previous work we have demonstrated that costly
PMs could be replaced by gaseous detectors with CsI photocathodes . Such
detectors have the same quantum efficiency as the best PMs but at the same time
are cheap, simple and have high position and time resolutions. The aim of this
work is to evaluate various planar type gaseous detectors with CsI photocahodes
in order to choose the best one for the detection of the primary scintillation
light from noble gases and liquids.

a number of phenomena in living cells such as cell motility, muscle contraction
and the active transport of material and organelles. Here we discuss mechanical
oscillations generated by active systems in cells. Examples are oscillatory
regimes in muscles, the periodic beating of axonemal cilia and flagella and
spontaneous oscillations of auditory hair cells which play a role in active
amplification of weak sounds in hearing. As a prototype system for oscillation
generation by proteins, we discuss a general mechanism by which many coupled
active elements such as motor molecules can generate oscillations.

is shown to be strongly influenced by the shape of the classical orbits of the
underlying classical phase space: we find a one-to-one correspondence between
maxima (minima) of the linear entropy and maxima (minima) of the expectation
value of atomic excitation J_z. Since the expectation value of this operator
can be viewed as related to the orbit radius in the classical phase space
projection associated to the atomic degree of freedom, the proximity of the
quantum wave packet to this atomic phase space borderline produces a maximum
rate of entanglement. The consequence of this fact for initial conditions
centered at periodic orbits in regular regions is a clear periodic recoherence.
For chaotic situations the same phenomenon (proximity of the atomic phase space
borderline) is in general responsible for oscillations in the entanglement
properties.

mechanics, is at the heart of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox and of the so
called quantum-nonlocality - the fact that a local realistic explanation of
quantum mechanics is not possible as quantitatively expressed by violation of
Bell's inequalities. Even as entanglement gains increasing importance in most
quantum information processing protocols, its conceptual foundation is still
widely debated. Among the open questions are: What is the conceptual meaning of
quantum entanglement? What are the most general constraints imposed by local
realism? Which general quantum states violate these constraints? Developing
Schroedinger's ideas in an information-theoretic context we suggest that a
natural understanding of quantum entanglement results when one accepts (1) that
the amount of information per elementary system is finite and (2) that the
information in a composite system resides more in the correlations than in
properties of individuals. The quantitative formulation of these ideas leads to
a rather natural criterion of quantum entanglement. Independently, extending
Bell's original ideas, we obtain a single general Bell inequality that
summarizes all possible constraints imposed by local realism on the
correlations for a multi-particle system. Violation of the general Bell
inequality results in an independent general criterion for quantum
entanglement. Most importantly, the two criteria agree in essence, though the
two approaches are conceptually very different. This concurrence strongly
supports the information-theoretic interpretation of quantum entanglement and
of quantum physics in general.

established that these properties are closely related by the way, in which
photons are detected after a polarizer beam splitter. On this basis we suggest
controlled experiments which, for the first time, subject the superposition
principle to experimental tests.
