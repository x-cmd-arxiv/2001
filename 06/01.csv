energetic processes associated with structure formation and chemical evolution
since the Big Bang. The COBE Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) and
Far Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer (FIRAS) were specifically designed to
search for this background from 1.25 microns to millimeter wavelengths. These
two instruments provided high quality, absolutely calibrated all-sky maps which
have enabled the first detections of the CIB, initially at far infrared and
submillimeter wavelengths, and more recently in the near infrared as well. The
aim of this paper is to review the status of determinations of the CIB based
upon COBE measurements. The results show that the energy in the CIB from far
infrared to millimeter wavelengths is comparable to that in the integrated
light of galaxies from UV to near infrared wavelengths: the universe had a
luminous but dusty past. On the assumption that nucleosynthesis in stars is the
energy source for most of this light, the results also imply that 1 to 8
percent of cosmic baryons has been converted to helium and heavier elements in
stars. The integrated background light from UV to millimeter wavelengths is
about 10 percent of that in the cosmic microwave background.

shepherd. We focus here on a massive and non-interacting charged scalar field
as an alternate option to the astronomical missing mass. We investigate the
classical solutions that describe the Bose condensate of such a field in
gravitational interaction with matter. This simplistic model accounts quite
well for the dark matter inside low-luminosity spirals whereas the agreement
lessens for the brightest objects where baryons dominate. A scalar mass m=0.4
to 1.6 10^{-23} eV is derived when both high and low-luminosity spirals are

entire parameter range for the zero lepton number case, perhaps restricting the
viability of singlet neutrino WDM models to those where singlet production is
driven by a significant lepton number. The Constellation X project has the
capability to detect/exclude singlet neutrino WDM for lepton number values up

for the cosmological constant will be available. By comparing the clustering
along and across the line of sight and modelling the effects of peculiar
velocities and bulk motions in redshift space, geometric distortions, which
occur if the wrong cosmology is assumed, can be detected.
  In this paper we investigate the effect of geometric and redshift-space
distortions in the power spectrum parallel and perpendicular to the observer's
line of sight. Ballinger et al. developed a model to estimate the cosmological
constant, $\Lambda$, and the important parameter $\beta \approx
\Omega_m^{0.6}/b$ from these distortions. We apply this model to a detailed
simulation of the final 25k 2QZ, produced using the Virgo Consortium's huge
{\it Hubble Volume} N-body $\Lambda$-CDM light cone simulation. We confirm the
conclusions of Ballinger et al.; the shape of the redshift-space and geometric
distortions are very similar. When all the uncertainties are taken into account
we find that only a joint $\Lambda - \beta$ constraint is possible.
  By combining this result with a second constraint based on mass clustering
evolution, however, we can make significant progress. We predict that this
method should allow us to constrain $\beta$ to approximately $\pm0.1$, and
$\Omega_{m}$ to $\pm0.25$ using the final catalogue. We apply the method to the
2QZ catalogue of 10000 QSOs and find that this incomplete catalogue marginally
favours a $\Lambda$ cosmology.

distributions into potentials and deriving the maximum ratios of the tangential

torques for 30 other galaxies determined from our previous $K$-band survey
(Buta & Block 2001). Relative bar torques determine the degree of spiral arm
forcing, gas accretion, and bar evolution. They differ from other measures of
bar strength, such as the relative amplitude of the bar determined
photometrically, because they include the bulge and other disk light that
contributes to the radial component of the total force. If the bulge is strong
and the radial forcing large, then even a prominent bar can have a relatively
weak influence on the azimuthal motions in the disk. Here we find that the
relative bar torque correlates only weakly with the optical bar type listed in
the Revised Shapley-Ames and de Vaucouleurs systems. In fact, some classically
barred galaxies have weaker relative bar torques than classically unbarred
galaxies. The optical class is a poor measure of azimuthal disk forcing for two
reasons: some infrared bars are not seen optically, and some bars with strong
bulges have their azimuthal forces so strongly diluted by the average radial
force that they exert only small torques on their disks. The Hubble
classification scheme poorly recognizes the gravitational influence of bars.
Applications of our bar torque method to the high-redshift universe are briefly
discussed.

(2-4)A, broad absorptions affecting the Balmer lines from Hdelta to Hbeta.
These broad absorptions are interpreted as the contribution of an underlying
white dwarf atmosphere. The characteristics of the absorptions are found to be
consistent with a DA log(g) = 8 white dwarf at a temperature of ~ 23 000 K,
contributing ~ 17 % (at 4500 A) to the overall flux. This is the first direct
detection of a white dwarf in an intermediate polar system. The absence of

oscillations between the perturbation of the inflaton field and the
perturbations of the other scalar degrees of freedom, similar to the phenomenon
of neutrino oscillations. Since the degree of the mixing is governed by the
squared mass matrix of the scalar fields, the oscillations can occur even if
the energy density of the extra scalar fields is much smaller than the energy
density of the inflaton field. The probability of oscillation is resonantly
amplified when perturbations cross the horizon and the perturbations in the
inflaton field may disappear at horizon crossing giving rise to perturbations
in scalar fields other than the inflaton. Adiabatic and isocurvature

a simple expression for the cross-correlation in terms of the slow-roll

severely criticizes a multitude of numerical results obtained by various groups

model of localization as ``entirely absurd'' and ``evident desinformation''.
These claims are based on the observation that there still is a large
disagreement between analytical, numerical and experimental results for the
critical exponent. The author proposes, based on a ``simple procedure to deal
with corrections to scaling'', that the numerical data support nu approx 1,
whereas recent numerical papers find nu = 1.58 +/- 0.06.
  As we show here, these claims are entirely wrong. The proposed scheme does
neither yield any improved accuracy when compared to the existing finite-size
scaling methods, nor does it give nu approx 1 when applied to high-precision
data. Rather, high-precision numerics with error epsilon approx 0.1% together
with all available finite-size-scaling methods evidently produce a critical
exponent nu approx 1.58.

the convergence to the limiting extremal distributions for finite datasets is
both slow and varies with the asymptote. However, when the third moment is

bandwidth, single cycle instruction execution and fast task switching support
to provide efficient multisignal processing. The processor's internal memory

for characteristic p valued L-series based on the work of Wan, Diaz-Vargas,
Thakur, Poonen, and Sheats for the zeta function $\zeta_{\Fr[\theta]}(s)$.
During the writing of math.NT/9907019, we made two assumptions that have
subsequently proved to be incorrect. The first assumption is that we can ignore
the trivial zeroes of characteristic p L-series in formulating our conjectures.
Instead, we show here how the trivial zeroes influence nearby zeroes and so
lead to counter-examples of the original Riemann hypothesis analog. We then
sketch an approach to handling such ``near-trivial'' zeroes via Hensel's and
Krasner's Lemmas (whereas classically one uses Gamma-factors). Moreover, we
show that $\zeta_{\Fr[\theta]}(s)$ is not representative of general L-series
as, surprisingly, all its zeroes are near-trivial, much as the Artin-Weil
zeta-function of $\mathbb{P}^1/\Fr$ is not representative of general complex
L-functions of curves over finite fields. Consequently, the ``critical zeroes''
(= all zeroes not effected by the trivial zeroes) of characteristic p L-series
now appear to be quite mysterious. The second assumption made while writing
math.NT/9907019 is that certain Taylor expansions of classical L-series of
number fields would exhibit complicated behavior with respect to their zeroes.
We present a simple argument that this is not so, and, at the same time, give a
characterization of functional equations.

algebro-geometric context. A direct application of the formality theorem to an
algebraic Poisson manifold gives a canonical sheaf of categories deforming
coherent sheaves. The global category is very degenerate in general. Thus, we
introduce a new notion of a semi-formal deformation, a replacement in algebraic
geometry of an actual deformation (versus a formal one). Deformed algebras
obtained by semi-formal deformations are Noetherian and have polynomial growth.
  We propose constructions of semi-formal quantizations of projective and
affine algebraic Poisson manifolds satisfying certain natural geometric
conditions. Projective symplectic manifolds (e.g. K3 surfaces and abelian
varieties) do not satisfy our conditions, but projective spaces with quadratic
Poisson brackets and Poisson-Lie groups can be semi-formally quantized.

give a random algorithm, along with a conjecture of how to improve its
convergence speed, in order to identify elements in the braid group, which are
conjugated to its generators for a given power. These elements of the braid
group, the half-twists, are important in themselves, as they are the key

atmospheric flows ranging from climate (thousands of kilometers - years) to
turbulence (millimeters - seconds) exhibit the universal symmetry of
self-similarity. Self-similarity or scale invariance implies long-range
spatiotemporal correlations and is manifested in atmospheric flows as the
fractal geometry to spatial pattern concomitant with inverse power-law form for
power spectra of temporal fluctuations. Long-range spatiotemporal correlations
are ubiquitous to dynamical systems in nature and are identified as signatures
of self-organized criticality. Standard meteorological theory cannot explain
satisfactorily the observed self-organized criticality. Numerical models for
simulation and prediction of atmospheric flows are subject to deterministic
chaos and give unrealistic solutions. Deterministic chaos is a direct
consequence of round-off error growth in iterative computations. Round-off
error of finite precision computations doubles on an average at each step of
iterative computations. Round-off error will propagate to the mainstream
computation and give unrealistic solutions in numerical weather prediction
(NWP) and climate models which incorporate thousands of iterative computations
in long-term numerical integration schemes. A recently developed
non-deterministic cell dynamical system model for atmospheric flows predicts
the observed self-organized criticality as intrinsic to quantumlike mechanics
governing flow dynamics.
