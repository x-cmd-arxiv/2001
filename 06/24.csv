The sample contains 103 galaxy clusters out to z=0.85 and flux-limit Flim=3
10^{-14} cgs (RDCS-3) in the [0.5-2.0] keV energy band, with a high-z extension
containing four clusters at 0.90<z<1.26 and F>1 10^{-14} cgs (RDCS-1). Model
predictions for the cluster mass function are converted into the X-ray
luminosity function in two steps. First we convert mass into intra-cluster gas
temperature by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. Then temperature is converted
into X-ray luminosity by using the most recent data on the Lx-T relation for
nearby and distant clusters. These include the Chandra data for seven distant
clusters at 0.57<z<1.27. From RDCS-3 we find \Omega_m=0.35+/-0.12 and
\sigma_8=0.66+/-0.06 for a spatially flat Universe with cosmological constant,
with no significant constraint on \Gamma . Even accounting for theoretical and
observational uncertainties in the mass/X-ray luminosity conversion, an
Einstein-de-Sitter model is always excluded at far more than the 3sigma level.

the AGB-tip does not vary measureably with radius. It is concluded that the
infrared bright AGB stars (1) belong to the bulge, and not the disk, and (2)
are well mixed throughout the inner bulge, suggesting that they formed at a

The bolometric luminosity functions of the M31 bulge and Baade's Window are in
excellent agreement, while the brightest AGB stars in the M31 bulge, the
Galactic bulge, and M32 have similar M_K. These data suggest that the brightest

  I. Shlosman and T.J. Mahoney",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The strongest starbursts are observed towards galaxy nuclei, or circumnuclear
regions. However in interacting galaxies, star formation is also triggered in
overlap regions far from nuclei, in spiral arms and sometimes in tidal tails.
What is the relative importance of these starbursts? What kind of starformation
is dominating, as a function of redshift? These different starbursts occur in
different dynamical conditions (global and local): gravitational instabilities,
density waves, radial flows, shear, cloud collisions, density accumulations,
and they have been investigated with the help of numerical simulations.
Gravitational instabilities are necessary to initiate star formation, but they
are not sufficient; galactic disks are self-regulated through these
instabilities to have their Toomre Q parameter of the order of 1, and thus this
criterium is in practice unable to predict the onset of intense star formation.
Super star clusters are a characteristic SF mode in starbursts, and might be
due to the rapid formation of large gas complexes. Star formation can propagate
radially inwards, due to gravity torques and gas inflow, but also outwards, due
to superwinds, and energy outflows: both expanding or collapsing waves are
observed in circumnuclear regions. Mergers are more efficient in forming stars
at high redshift, because of larger gas content, and shorter dynamical times.
The relation between nuclear starbursts and nuclear activity is based on the
same fueling mechanisms, but also on reciprocal triggering and regulations.

alloy phase diagrams is the difficulty to account for lattice vibrations. A
survey of the theoretical and experimental literature seeking to quantify the
impact of lattice vibrations on phase stability indicates that this effect can
be substantial. Typical vibrational entropy differences between phases are of
the order of 0.1 to 0.2 k_B/atom, which is comparable to the typical values of
configurational entropy differences in binary alloys (at most 0.693 k_B/atom).
This paper describes the basic formalism underlying ab initio phase diagram
calculations, along with the generalization required to account for lattice
vibrations. We overview the various techniques allowing the theoretical
calculation and the experimental determination of phonon dispersion curves and
related thermodynamic quantities, such as vibrational entropy or free energy. A
clear picture of the origin of vibrational entropy differences between phases
in an alloy system is presented that goes beyond the traditional bond counting
and volume change arguments. Vibrational entropy change can be attributed to
the changes in chemical bond stiffness associated with the changes in bond
length that take place during a phase transformation. This so-called ``bond
stiffness vs. bond length'' interpretation both summarizes the key phenomenon
driving vibrational entropy changes and provides a practical tool to model
them.

generated by the presence of fluctuations on the interactions between measuring
apparatus and physical system, we show that the quantum structure can find its
origin in the presence of these fluctuations. This appraoch, that we have
called the 'hidden measurement approach', makes it possible to construct
systems that are in between quantum and classical. We show that two of the
traditional axioms of quantum axiomatics are not satisfied for these 'in
between quantum and classical' situations, and how this structural shortcoming
of standard quantum mechanics is at the origin of most of the quantum
paradoxes. We show that in this approach the EPR paradox identifies a genuine
incompleteness of standard quantum mechanics, however not an incompleteness
that means the lacking of hidden variables, but an incompleteness pointing at
the impossibility for standard quantum mechanics to describe separated quantum
systems. We indicate in which way, by redefining the meaning of density states,
standard quantum mechanics can be completed. We put forward in which way the

a physical system is complete in the sense of providing definite answers for
all possible questions that can be asked of the system. In the quantum world,
maximal information is not complete and cannot be completed. Using this
distinction, we show that any Bayesian probability assignment in quantum
mechanics must have the form of the quantum probability rule, that maximal
information about a quantum system leads to a unique quantum-state assignment,
and that quantum theory provides a stronger connection between probability and
measured frequency than can be justified classically. Finally we give a
Bayesian formulation of quantum-state tomography.

the respect to Bose operators. We find subspaces, preserved by the action of
Hamiltonian These subspaces, being finite-dimensional, include, nonetheless,
states with an \QTR{it}{infinite} number of quasi-particles, corresponding to
the original Bose operators. The basis functions look rather simple in the
coherent state representation and are expressed in terms of the degenerate
hypergeometric function with respect to the complex variable labeling the
representation. In some particular degenerate cases they turn (up to the power
factor) into the trigonometric or hyperbolic functions, Bessel functions or
combinations of the exponent and Hermit polynomials. We find explicitly the
relationship between coefficients at different powers of Bose operators that
ensure quasi-exact solvability of Hamiltonian.
