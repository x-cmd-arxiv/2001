the X-ray brightest galaxy clusters detected in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey in the
southern sky, is used to construct the X-ray luminosity function of clusters in
the local Universe. With 452 clusters detected above an X-ray flux-limit of 3
10^(-12) erg s^(-1) cm^(-2) in 4.24 sr of the sky, this sample is the most
comprehensive X-ray cluster sample with a well documented selection function,

In this paper we discuss the construction of the luminosity function, the
effects of flux measurement errors and of variations with sample region and we

nuclei have now firmly established that many galaxies host central supermassive
black holes (SMBHs) with masses in the range $10^6 \sim 10^9$M$_{\odot}$.
However, how these SMBHs formed is not well understood. One reason for this
situation is the lack of observations of intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs), which
could bridge the gap between stellar-mass BHs and SMBHs. Recently, this missing
link (i.e., an IMBH) has been found in observations made by the ASCA and the
Chandra of the central region of the starburst galaxy M82 \citep{MT99, PG99,
MT01, Ka01}. Subsequent observations by SUBARU have revealed that this IMBH
apparently coincides with a young compact star cluster. Based on these
findings, we suggest a new formation scenario for SMBHs. In this scenario,
IMBHs first form in young compact star clusters through runaway merging of
massive stars. While these IMBHs are forming, the host star clusters sink
toward the galactic nucleus through dynamical friction, and upon evaporation
deposit their IMBHs near the galactic center. The IMBHs then form binaries and
eventually merge via gravitational radiation, forming an SMBH.

number, which characterizes thermal fluctuations, and by a parameter which
describes the strength of the quenched disorder in the flux-line lattice. In
the framework of this unified approach we obtain the H-T phase diagrams for
both conventional and high-Tc superconductors. Several well-known experimental
results concerning the fishtail effect and the phase diagram of high-Tc
superconductors are naturally explained by assuming that a peak effect in the
critical current density versus H signalizes the order - disorder transition
line in superconductors with point defects.

of an interplay between r_0 and the inter-particle distance r_s which we deem
generic to interactions of this type. However such interplay, responsible for
the preference of a d-wave state for a range of intermediate densities, takes
place only in the BCS limit. In contrast, as the Bose-Einstein (BE) limit is
approached the internal energy of the ""preformed pairs"" becomes the dominant
contribution and there is a quantum phase transition in which the s-wave
symmetry is restored. We also find that the limiting value of the critical
temperature is k_B T_c --> 3.315(\hbar^2/2m*)[n/2(2l+1)]^{2/3}, which coincides
with the usual result only for l=0; for l>0, it differs in the degeneracy

O(n)-symmetric models on a three-dimensional lattice by analysing the recent
Monte Carlo (MC) data. We have found that the effective critical exponent,
estimated at finite sizes of the system L and L/2, decreases remarkably within
the range of the simulated L values. This shows the incorrectness of some
claims that omega has a very accurate value 0.845(10) at n=1. A selfconsistent
infinite volume extrapolation yields row estimates omega=0.547, omega=0.573,
and omega=0.625 at n=1, 2, and 3, respectively, in approximate agreement with
the corresponding exact values 1/2, 5/9, and 3/5 predicted by our recently
developed GFD (grouping of Feynman diagrams) theory. We have fitted the MC data
for the susceptibility of 3D Ising model at criticality showing that the
effective critical exponent eta tends to increase well above the usually
accepted values around 0.036. We have fitted the data within [L;8L], including
several terms in the asymptotic expansion with fixed exponents, to obtain the
effective amplitudes depending on L. This method clearly demonstrates that the
critical exponents of GFD theory are correct (the amplitudes converge to
certain asymptotic values at L tending to infinity), whereas those of the
perturbative renormalization group (RG) theory are incorrect (the amplitudes
diverge). A modification of the standard Ising model by introducing suitable
""improved"" action (Hamiltonian) does not solve the problem in favour of the
perturbative RG theory.

field, endowed with an effective metric tensor $\tilde{g}^{\mu \nu}=\eta^{\mu
\nu}+(n^2-1)u^\mu u^\nu$, $n$ being the refractive index and $u^\mu$ the
four-velocity of the medium. Leonhardt and Piwnicki [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 60},
4301 (1999)] argued that a flowing dielectric fluid of this kind can be used to
generate an 'optical black hole'. In the Leonhardt-Piwnicki model, only a
vortex flow was considered. It was later pointed out by Visser [Phys. Rev.
Lett. {\bf 85}, 5252 (2000)] that in order to form a proper optical black hole
containing an event horizon, it becomes necessary to add an inward radial
velocity component to the vortex flow. In the present paper we undertake this
task: we consider a full spiral flow, consisting of a vortex component plus a
radially infalling component. Light propagates in such a dielectric medium in a
way similar to that occurring around a rotating black hole. We calculate, and
show graphically, the effective potential versus the radial distance from the
vortex singularity, and show that the spiral flow can always capture light in
both a positive, and a negative, inverse impact parameter interval. The
existence of a genuine event horizon is found to depend on the strength of the
radial flow, relative to the strength of the azimuthal flow. A limitation of
our fluid model is that it is nondispersive.

neutrino data and in some studies of future neutrino oscillation experiments is
to assume one dominant scale, $\Delta m^2$, of neutrino mass squared
differences, in particular, $\Delta m^2_{atm} \sim 3 \times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$.
Here we investigate the corrections to this approximation arising from the
quantity $\Delta m^2_{sol}$ relevant for solar neutrino oscillations, assuming
the large mixing angle solution. We show that for values of
$\sin^2(2\theta_{13}) \sim 10^{-2}$ (in the range of interest for long-baseline
neutrino oscillation experiments with either intense conventional neutrino
beams such as JHF-SuperK or a possible future neutrino factory) and for $\Delta
m^2_{sol} \sim 10^{-4}$ eV$^2$, the contributions to $\nu_\mu \to\nu_e$
oscillations from both CP-conserving and CP-violating terms involving
$\sin^2(\Delta m^2_{sol}L/(4E))$ can be comparable to the terms involving
$\sin^2(\Delta m^2_{atm}L/(4E))$ retained in the one-$\Delta m^2$
approximation. Accordingly, we emphasize the importance of performing a full
three-flavor, two-$\Delta m^2$ analysis of the data on $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$
oscillations in a conventional-beam experiment and $\nu_e \to \nu_\mu$,
$\bar\nu_e \to \bar\nu_\mu$ oscillations at a neutrino factory. We also discuss
a generalized analysis method for the KamLAND reactor experiment, and note how
the information from this experiment can be used to facilitate the analysis of
the subsequent data on $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ oscillations. Finally, we consider
the analysis of atmospheric neutrino data and present calculations of matter
effects in a three-flavor, two-$\Delta m^2$ framework relevant to this data and
to neutrino factory measurements.

of the possible arrival times of the signal, the neutrino flux crosses a
substantial amount of the matter of the Earth at least for one of the existing
detectors. For oscillation parameters from the LMA solution of the solar
neutrino problem the Earth matter effect consists in an oscillatory modulation
of the $\barnue$ and/or $\nu_e$ energy spectra. The relative deviation with
respect to the undistorted spectra can be as large as 20-30 % for E> 20 MeV and
70-100 % for E> 40 MeV. For parameters from the

observation of oscillatory distortions of the energy spectra in a single

detectors. For a supernova at distance D=10 Kpc, comparing the results of

contraction which reduces the super-AdS group to the ""nondegenerate""

  7-10, 2001",,"10.1142/9789812810878_0037",,"nucl-th",,"  We present a quark model study of the $\omega$ meson photoproduction near
threshold. With a limited number of parameters, all the data in history are
reproduced. The roles played by the {\it s}- and {\it u}-channel processes
(resonance excitations and nucleon pole terms), as well as the {\it t}-channel
{\it natural} (Pomeron) and {\it unnatural} parity (pion) exchanges are
clarified. This approach provides a framework for systematic study of vector
meson photoproduction near threshold.

spreading of infection of the Herpes Simplex Virus in corneal tissue are
investigated through the dynamic Monte Carlo method. The model takes into
account different cell susceptibilities to the viral infection, as suggested by
experimental findings. In a two-dimensional square lattice, the sites are
associated to two distinct types of cells, namely, permissive and resistant to
the infection. While a permissive cell becomes infected in the presence of a
single infected cell in its neighborhood, a resistant cell needs to be
surrounded by at least R>1 infected or dead cells in order to become infected.
The infection is followed by the death of the cells resulting in ulcers whose
forms may be dendritic (self-limited clusters) or amoeboid (percolating
clusters) depending on the degree of resistance R of the resistant cells as
well as on the density of permissive cells in the healthy tissue. We show that
a phase transition between these two regimes occurs only for R>=5 and, in
addition, that the phase-transition is in the universality class of the
ordinary percolation.

measure defined by such a computational model is related to gate complexity and
a continuous complexity measure introduced in a former paper. We use
majorization of graph spectra for classifying Hamiltonians with respect to

to create interference. The experiment can be considered an optical analogy of
an experiment proposed by Scully, Englert and Walther. One photon of an
entangled pair is incident on a Young double-slit of appropriate dimensions to
create an interference pattern in a distant detection region. Quarter-wave
plates, oriented so that their fast axes are orthogonal, are placed in front of
each slit to serve as which-path markers. The quarter-wave plates mark the
polarization of the interfering photon and thus destroy the interference
pattern. To recover interference, we measure the polarization of the other
entangled photon. In addition, we perform the experiment under delayed erasure
circumstances.

formula, the ratio of the quantum mutual information and the von Neumann
entropy of the sender's share of the noisy entanglement plays the role of
mutual information in the completely classical case. A consequence of our
results is that bound entangled states cannot increase the capacity of a
noiseless quantum channel.
