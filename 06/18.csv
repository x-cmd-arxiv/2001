case of the study of high-redshift galaxies has been carried out with
simulations based on galaxy SEDs derived from the currently available empirical
and model templates and on plausible standard filter-sets. In order to
correctly identify star forming galaxies in the redshift range 5<z<9 and
early-type galaxies above z>2 and avoid confusion with other SEDs it is
mandatory to have photometric information in optical bands, besides a standard
IR filter-set like F110 F160 K L M. In particular by adding the V606, I814 and
z-Gunn filters a good discrimination is obtained above z>5 for star forming
galaxies and z>1 for early-types. The case for an extension of the NGST
wavelength domain to the optical range is therefore strongly supported by this
analysis. The effects of leaks in the filter blocking have also been
investigated. In spite of rather pessimistic assumptions (a constant leak at a
level of 10^{-4} of the peak transmission over the whole spectral range or a
leak of Gaussian shape placed at 1.5 times the effective wavelength of the
filter with an amplitude of 10^{-3} of the peak transmission and a width of 5%
of the central wavelength) the effects are not dramatic: the accuracy of the
determination of photometric redshifts with a standard V606 I814 z-Gunn F110
F160 K L M filter set does not significantly deteriorate for a sample limited
to M_AB~30. In the range 5.5<z<12.5 a rather high accuracy with a typical error
|z_sim-z_phot|<=0.2 is achieved. With the filter blocking achieved by the
present standard technology, extended and continuous spectral coverage appears
to be the driving factor to maximize the scientific output.

magnetic field structure. Unlike solar-type alpha-omega dynamos, the rotation
has only a small role in amplifying the toroidal component of the magnetic
field. The large-scale magnetic field is strong enough for the formation of
magnetic cool spots on the AGB stellar surface. The spots can regulate dust
formation, hence mass loss rate, leading to axisymmetric mass loss and the
formation of elliptical planetary nebulae (PNe). Despite its role in forming
cool spots, the large scale magnetic field is too weak to play a dynamic role
and directly influence the wind from the AGB star. We find other problems in

along the symmetry axis outside the Homunculus. The model assumes that each

surrounding gas is ionized first, becomes much hotter, and compresses the gas
in the shadow. This leads to the formation of a radial, dense, long, and narrow
region, i.e., a string. Later the neutral material in the strings is ionized,
and becomes brighter. Still later it re-expands, and we predict that in about
200 years the strings will fade. The condition for the model to work is that
the ionization front, due to the diffuse ionizing recombination radiation of
the surrounding gas, proceeds into the shadow at a velocity slower than the
compression speed. From that we get a condition on the mass loss rate of the
mass loss episode that formed the strings, which should be less than 10^{-4}

Explicit 5d theories are constructed with gauge groups SU(3) \times SU(2)
\times U(1) and SU(5), with matter in the bulk or on the brane, which lead to
the (next-to) minimal supersymmetric standard model below the compactification
scale. In all cases the soft supersymmetry-breaking and \mu parameters
originate from bulk kinetic energy terms, and are highly constrained. The
supersymmetric flavor and CP problems are solved.

is a related approximation made to the SD equations of the original formulation

chosen group, while the Wigner function is defined on a coadjoint orbit of the
group and serves as an alternative characterization of the signal, which is
often used in practical applications. The Plancherel transform maps
$L^2$-functions on a group unitarily to fields of Hilbert-Schmidt operators,

transform can essentiallly be looked upon as restricted inverse Plancherel

except that these models predict very weak antiflow of pions. The more detailed
comparison with the QGSM suggests that the decay of resonances and rescattering
of secondaries dominantly determine the proton and negative pion flow at this
energy.

with in-medium spectral shift and broadening of vector mesons. It is observed
that both the WA98 photon data and CERES/NA45 dilepton data can be well
reproduced with similar initial conditions. The freeze-out condition has been
constrained by the transverse mass spectra of pions and protons measured by the
NA49 collaboration. We argue that simultaneous measurement of the $p_T$ spectra
of single photons as well as invariant mass distribution of dileptons is
crucial to understand the in-medium spectral function of the vector mesons.

  suspensions","15 pages. To appear Momento - Revista de Fisica (June 2001)",,,,"physics.optics physics.gen-ph",,"  We discuss on the potential of suspensions of gold nanoparticles with
variable refractive index for the possible physical realization of in-relief
virtual dynamic display of plane images. A reasoning approach for a vision
system to display in real-time volumetric moving images is proposed based on
well-known properties of optical media, namely the anomalous dispersion of
light on certain transparent media and the virtual image formed by a refracting
transparent surface. The system relies on creating mechanisms to modify the
refractive index of in-relief virtual dynamical display (iVDD) bulbs that
ideally would contain a suspension of gold nanoparticles each and that might be
ordered in an array filling up a whole screen.

generalises yet another property of the pilot-wave theory of de Broglie and
Bohm. The theorem supports the hypothesis that in the remote past the universe
relaxed to a state of statistical equilibrium (at the hidden-variable level) in
which nonlocality happens to be masked by quantum noise.

Spectroscopy, involving network of coupled spins, use temporary spin-decoupling
to produce desired effective Hamiltonians. In this paper, we show that
significant time can be saved in producing an effective Hamiltonian, if
spin-decoupling is avoided. We provide time optimal pulse sequences for
producing an important class of effective Hamiltonians in three spin networks.
These effective Hamiltonians are useful for coherence transfer experiments and
implementation of quantum logic gates in NMR quantum computing. It is
demonstrated that computing these time optimal pulse sequences can be reduced
to geometric problems that involve computing sub-Riemannian geodesics on
Homogeneous spaces.

opposite-subsystem observables the measurement of one of which amounts to the
same as that of the other (so-called twins), begun in a recent article,
so-called strong twin events, which imply biorthogonal mixing of states, are
defined and studied. It is shown that for each mixed state there exists a
Schmidt canonical (super state vector) expansion in terms of Hermitian
operators, and that it can be the continuation of the mentioned biorthogonal
mixing due to strong twins. The case of weak twins and nonhermitian Schmidt
canonical expansion is also investigated. A necessary and sufficient condition
for the existence of nontrivial twins for separable states is derived.
