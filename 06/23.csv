Dark energy modifies the distance-redshift relation as well as the matter power
spectrum, both of which affect the weak lensing convergence power spectrum.
Some dark-energy models predict additional clustering on very large scales, but
this probably cannot be detected by weak lensing alone due to cosmic variance.
With reasonable prior information on other cosmological parameters, we find
that a survey covering 1000 sq. deg. down to a limiting magnitude of R=27 can
impose constraints comparable to those expected from upcoming type Ia supernova
and number-count surveys. This result, however, is contingent on the control of
both observational and theoretical systematics. Concentrating on the latter, we
find that the {\it nonlinear} power spectrum of matter perturbations and the
redshift distribution of source galaxies both need to be determined accurately
in order for weak lensing to achieve its full potential. Finally, we discuss
the sensitivity of the three-point statistics to dark energy.

during their evolution, as strongly suggested by recent observations.
Consequently a black hole binary (BHB) emerges. Considering the evolution of
the binary when it has become hard, at a separation of the BHs of about 1 pc,
we propose to solve two basic questions in our understanding of the central
activity of galaxies: (1) Do the BHs actually merge? (2) And does the effect of
the torque of the BHB on the surrounding stellar distribution help to explain
the presence of the ubiquitous torus of molecular material surrounding
apparently all active galactic nuclei? While the second question is the topic
of a subsequent paper we try to solve the first in this article. Simulating the
evolution of a stellar cluster in the potential of such a binary by solving the
equations of the restricted three body problem, we obtained the following
results: If the cluster is about as massive as the BHB, the two BHs coalesce
after about 10^7 yr due to ejection of stars with low angular momentum and
finally via emission of gravitational radiation. In a sequence of models where
the mass of the secondary BH increases while M_1 is fixed, a bigger fraction of
stars is ejected. For a more massive cluster the merger then proceeds on
smaller time scales. The cluster is depleted in the central region and the
final distribution of stars assumes a torus-like structure, peaking at three
times the initial distance of the two black holes.

depends on the parameter defining the quintessence state equation. Specializing
at several particular values of that parameter, we obtain solutions to the

It is found that these solutions can represent either asymptotically anti-de
Sitter wormholes or pure anti-de Sitter spaces whose quantum states are
obtained by means of the Wheeler de Witt equation. Starting with the different
five-dimensional solutions, an instantonic procedure is applied to describe the
creation of geometrically equivalent inflating de Sitter branes whose quantum

observed from several non-active galaxies (NGC 5905, RXJ1242-11, RXJ1624+75,
RXJ1420+53, RXJ1331-32). All of them share similar properties, namely: extreme
X-ray softness in outburst, huge peak luminosity (up to ~10^{44} erg/s), and
the absence of optical signs of Seyfert activity. Tidal disruption of a star by
a supermassive black hole is the favored explanation of these unusual events.
  We present a review of the previous results, a search for radio emission from
all outbursters, based on the NVSS database, and dedicated radio observations
of NGC 5905 carried out with the VLA. These provide important constraints on
the presence of an (obscured) active nucleus (AGN) at the center of each
flaring galaxy. We rigorously explore AGN scenarios to account for the unusual
X-ray outbursts from the optically `normal' galaxies and find AGN-related
models highly unlikely. We conclude that the previously favored scenario -
tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole at the center of each
of the outbursters - provides the best explanation for the X-ray observations.
  Finally, we present results from our on-going search for further X-ray flares
from a sample of ~140 nearby active and non-active galaxies, using the ROSAT
data base. While we do not find another X-ray flaring normal galaxy among this
sample - entirely consistent with the predictions of the tidal disruption
scenario - several highly variable active galaxies are detected. Their
variability is not linked to tidal disruption, but best explained in terms of
absorption or accretion-disk-related models.

significantly reduced due to absorption by the known damped Lya systems, to

density fluctuations in the ionized interstellar medium. Although this density
spectrum is suggestive of turbulence, no theory relevant to its interpretation
exists. We calculate the density spectrum in turbulent magnetized plasmas by
extending the theory of incompressible MHD turbulence given by Goldreich &
Sridhar to include the effects of compressibility and particle transport. Our
most important results are as follows. (1) Density fluctuations are due to the
slow mode and the entropy mode. Both modes are passively mixed by the cascade
of shear Alfven waves. Since the shear Alfven waves have a Kolmogorov spectrum,
so do the density fluctuations. (2) Observed density fluctuation amplitudes
imply either that the magnetic and gas pressures are comparable, or that the
outer scale of the turbulence is very small. (3) A high degree of ionization is
required for the cascade to survive damping by neutrals and thereby to extend
to small lengthscales. Regions that are insufficiently ionized produce density
fluctuations only on lengthscales larger than the neutral damping scale. These
regions may account for the excess of power that is found on large scales. (4)
Both the entropy mode and the slow mode are damped on lengthscales below that
at which protons can diffuse across an eddy during the eddy's turnover time.
Consequently, eddies whose extents along the magnetic field are smaller than
the proton collisional mean free path do not contribute to the density
spectrum. However, in MHD turbulence eddies are highly elongated along the
magnetic field. From an observational perspective, the relevant lengthscale is
that transverse to the magnetic field. Thus the cut-off lengthscale for density
fluctuations is significantly smaller than the proton mean free path.

galaxies to be mainly made by early-type galaxies with very red colours
($b_J-R$ up to $\sim 4$) and a radio-to-optical ratio $10^2\simlt r\simlt

show $r\simgt 10^4$ and $0\simlt b_J -R \simlt 1$. On the basis of the $R$
magnitudes, we estimate the sample of radio galaxies to be complete up to
$z\simeq 0.3$. We can therefore divide the whole sample of radio sources into a

Model (MSSM) in the framework of the three most prominent soft SUSY-breaking
scenarios, mSUGRA, MGMSB and mAMSB. For each scenario, we determine the
parameters at the electroweak scale from the set of input variables at higher
energy scales (depending on the specific scenario) and evaluate the Higgs boson
properties. The latter are based on results obtained within the
Feynman-diagrammatic approach by taking into account the complete one-loop and
the dominant two-loop contributions. The maximum value of the mass of the
lightest neutral CP-even MSSM Higgs boson, m_h, is determined in the three
scenarios, and the behavior of the Higgs couplings to fermions and gauge bosons
is investigated. Restrictions on tan beta and on the set of higher-energy scale
parameters are derived from the lower limits arising from the Higgs search at
LEP2. We furthermore discuss the regions of parameter space in the three
scenarios compatible with interpreting the excess observed at LEP2 as a Higgs
signal, with m_h = (115.0 + 1.3 - 0.9) GeV. The case where the events observed
at LEP2 could originate from the production of the heavier neutral CP-even
Higgs boson is also considered. The implications of a possible Higgs signal at
115 GeV for SUSY searches at future colliders are briefly discussed for each of
the three scenarios.

detailed analysis of the time-evolution of an idealized region of disoriented
chiral condensate. We set up a Langevin field equation which can describe the
evolution of these (or more realistic) linear sigma model configurations in
contact with a heat bath representing the presence of other shorter wavelength
degrees of freedom. We first analyze the model in equilibrium, paying
particular attention to subtracting ultraviolet divergent classical terms and
replacing them by their finite quantum counterparts. We use known results from
lattice gauge theory and chiral perturbation theory to fix nonuniversal
constants. The result is a theory which is ultraviolet cutoff independent and
that reproduces quantitatively the expected equilibrium behavior of the quantum
field theory of pions and sigma fields over a wide range of temperatures.
Finally, we estimate the viscosity $\eta(T)$, which controls the dynamical
timescale in the Langevin equation, by requiring that the timescale for DCC
decay agrees with previous calculations. The resulting $\eta(T)$ is larger than
that found perturbatively. We also determine the temperature below which the
classical field Langevin equation ceases to be a good model for the quantum
field dynamics.

for achieving this synthesis, major paradigm shifts are needed as also the

means of achieving such a grand synthesis. Currently the main pillars

Statistical thermodynamic concepts, heat and entropy, (iv) Mathematical
concepts, tools and techniques serving both as a grand plan and the means of
calculation and last but not least v)Controlled observation, pertinent

than an additional dimension. A new entity called ""Ekon"" having the properties
of both space and momentum is introduced along with a space called

mathematical aperatus required have been formulated which is highly suited for
the purpose. The primacy of the Plancks quantum of action and its

time problem for one particle. Our approach suggests an individual asymptotic
description of the quantum subensembles of transmitted and reflected particles
both at the final and initial stage of tunneling. We find the initial states of
both subensembles, which are non-orthogonal. The latter reflects ultimately the
fact that at the initial stage of tunneling it is impossible to predict whether
a particle will be transmitted through or reflected off the barrier. At the
same time, in this case, one can say about the to-be-transmitted and
to-be-reflected subensembles of particles. We show that before the interaction
of the incident packet with the barrier both the number of particles and the
expectation value of the particle's momentum are constant for each subensemble.
Besides, these asymptotic quantities coincide with those of the corresponding
scattered subensemble. On the basis of this formalism we define individual
delay times for both scattering channels. Taking into account the spreading of
wave packets, we define the low bound of the scattering time to describe the
whole quantum ensemble of particles. All three characteristic times are derived
in terms of the expectation values of the position and momentum operators. The
condition which must be fulfilled for completed scattering events is derived.
We propose also the scheme of a {\it gedanken} experiment that allows one to
verify our approach.

present a numerical study of a classically chaotic 2-D Hamiltonian system -
harmonic oscillators with anharmonic coupling. We construct the quantum action
non-perturbatively and find temperature dependent quantum corrections in the
action parameters. We compare Poincar\'{e} sections of the quantum action at
finite temperature with those of the classical action.
