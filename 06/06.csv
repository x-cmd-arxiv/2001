  comments",,"10.1086/323542",,"astro-ph",,"  We present the first results from the Faint Infra-Red Extragalactic Survey
(FIRES) of the Hubble Deep Field South. Using a combination of deep near
infrared data obtained with ISAAC at the VLT with the WFPC2 HST data, we
construct a K-band selected sample of 136 galaxies with K(AB)<=23.5. We derive
zphot's using a newly developed technique which models the observed spectral
energy distribution with a linear combination of empirical galaxy templates.
Testing our zphot technique against spectroscopic redshifts in the HDF-N yields
dz/(1+z)~0.07 for z<6. We show that we can derive realistic error estimates in
zphot by combining the systematic uncertainties derived from the HDF-N with
errors in zphot which depend on the observed flux errors. The redshift
histogram of galaxies in the HDF-S shows distinct structure with a sharp peak
at z~0.5 and a broad enhancement at z~1-1.4. We find that 12% of our galaxies
with K(vega)<21 lie at z>=2. While this is higher than the fraction predicted
in Omega_M=1 hierarchical models of galaxy formation we find that published
predictions using pure luminosity evolution models produce too many bright
galaxies at redshifts greater than unity. Finally, we use our broad wavelength
coverage to measure the rest-frame UBV luminosities Lrest for z<=3. There is a
paucity of galaxies brighter than Lrest_V>=1.4e10 h^{-2}Lsun at z~1.5-2,
however, at z>2 we find very luminous galaxies with Lrest_V>=5e10 h^{-2}Lsun
(for Omega_M=0.3,Lambda=0.7, H_o=100 h km s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}). Local B-band
luminosity functions predict 0.1 galaxies in the redshift range 2<=z<=3.5 and
with Lrest_B>= 5e10 h^{-2}Lsun,B but we find 9. The discrepancy can be
explained if L*_B increases by a factor of 2.4-3.2 with respect to locally
determined values (abridged).

We discuss the details of a representative sample of dark energy models and
show how future supernova observations could distinguish among these. As a
specific example, we consider the proposed ``SNAP'' satellite which is planned
to observe around 2000 supernovae. We show how a SNAP-class data set taken
alone would be a powerful discriminator among a family of models that would be
approximated by a constant equation of state for the most recent epoch of
cosmic expansion. We show how this family includes most of the dark energy
models proposed so far. We then show how an independent measurement of
$\Omega_{\rm m}$ can allow SNAP to probe the evolution of the equation of state
as well, allowing further discrimination among a larger class of proposed dark
energy models. We study the impact of the satellite design parameters on this
method to distinguish the models and compare SNAP to alternative measurements.
We establish that if we exploit the full precision of SNAP it provides a very
powerful probe.

  Abundance","15 pages, 10 figures. to be published in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20010848",,"astro-ph",,"  The lithium plateau observed in halo stars has long appeared as a paradox in
the general context of the lithium abundance behavior in stellar outer layers.
First, the plateau is flat, second, the lithium abundance dispersion is
extremely small. This seems in contradiction with the large lithium variations
observed in younger stars. It is also difficult to understand theoretically as
lithium nuclei are easily destroyed by nuclear reactions, and subject to
microscopic diffusion which, in the case of halo stars, should also lead to
depletion. Several ideas have been proposed to account for the lithium behavior
in halo stars. The most promising possibilities were rotational-induced mixing,
which could reduce lithium in the same way for all the stars, and mass-loss,
which could oppose the lithium settling. In both cases however, the parameters
should be tightly adjusted to prevent any dispersion in the final results.
Vauclair 1999 (paper I) pointed out that the mu-gradient terms which appear in
the computations of the meridional circulation velocity were not introduced in
previous computations of rotationally-induced mixing. This can lead to a
self-regulating process which reduces the efficiency of the meridional
circulation as well as the microscopic diffusion. Here we present numerical
computations of this process and its influence on the lithium abundance
variations in halo stars. We show that in slowly rotating stars, under some
conditions, lithium can be depleted by a factor of up to two with a dispersion
smaller than 0.1 dex in the middle part of the lithium plateau. We derive a
primordial lithium abundance of 2.5 +/- 0.1, consistent with the recent
determinations of D/H and 4He/H.

-3<[Fe/H]<-1 can be explained by the contributions of three sources. The
sources are: the first generations of very massive (>100 solar masses) stars
that are formed from Big Bang debris and are distinct from SNII, and two types
of SNII, the H and L events, which can occur only at [Fe/H]>-3. The H events
are of high frequency and produce dominantly heavy (A>130) r-elements but no Fe
(presumably leaving behind black holes). The L events are of low frequency and
produce Fe and dominantly light (A<130) r-elements (essentially none above Ba).
By using the observed abundances in two ultra-metal-poor stars and the solar
r-abundances, the initial or prompt inventory of elements produced by the first
generations of very massive stars and the yields of H and L events can be
determined. The abundances of a large number of elements in a star can then be
calculated from the model by using only the observed Eu and Fe abundances. To
match the model results and the observational data for stars with -3<[Fe/H]<-1
requires that the solar r-abundances for Sr, Y, Zr, and Ba must be
significantly increased from the standard values. Whether the solar
r-components of these elements used here to obtain a fit to the stellar data
can be reconciled with those obtained from solar abundances by subtracting the
s-components calculated from models is not clear.

with masses in the range 10^6 - 10^9 solar masses in their cores. Occasionally,
compact stars can plunge into SMBH. In addition, there may be a number of such
compact objects circling the central SMBH in any given quasar. Both of these
processes are known to emit gravitational waves. LISA has the right sensitivity
to detect these waves. We show that gravitational lenses amplify the amplitudes
of these gravitational waves just as they amplify the observed light of
quasars. Given the geometry of the lensing configuration, this amplification
can be as large as a factor of 2 to 10, allowing the waves to be above the
detection threshold of LISA. We also show that waves from lensed quasars arrive
with time delays which are much larger than the coherence time of the
gravitational waves, making interference effects negligible. Thus, a simple
geometrical optics application leads to the lensing theory of gravitational
waves. In this context, we analyze and show in this preliminary analysis that
there is an enhancement of the amplitudes of gravitational radiation coming
from observed lensed quasars.

100 days after outburst, which is assumed to coincide with GRB980425. Early in
the nebular epoch the spectra show the characteristics of a typical SN Ic
spectrum, with strong lines of [OI], CaII and MgI], and lines of [FeII].
However, the [FeII] lines are unusually strong for a SN Ic. Also, lines of
different elements have different widths, indicating different expansion
velocities. In particular, iron appears to expand more rapidly than oxygen.
Furthermore, the [OI] nebular lines decline more slowly than the [FeII] ones,
signalling deposition of gamma-rays in a slowly-moving O-dominated region.
These facts suggest that the explosion was aspherical. The absence of [FeIII]
nebular lines can be understood if the ejecta are significantly clumped. A
schematic picture of what this very unusual stellar explosion may have looked

gravitational theory must take the place of general relativity (GR) on the
largest scales. Dynamical measurements can be used to investigate the nature of
such a theory, but only where there is visible matter. Gravitational lensing is
potentially a more powerful probe as it can be used to measure deflections far
from the deflector, and, for sufficiently large separations, allow it to be
treated as a point-mass. Microlensing within the local group does not yet
provide any interesting constraints, as only images formed close to the
deflectors are appreciably magnified, but stacking of multiple light-curves and
observations of microlensing on cosmological scales may be able to discriminate
between GR and non-dark matter theories. Galaxy-galaxy lensing is likely to be
an even more powerful probe of gravity, with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) commissioning data used here to constrain the deflection law of galaxies
to be A(R) propto R^(0.1 +/- 0.1) for impact parameters in the range 50 kpc < R
< 1 Mpc. Together with observations of flat rotation curves, these results
imply that, in any gravitational theory, photons must experience (close to)
twice the deflection of massive particles moving at the speed of light (at
least on these physical scales). The full SDSS data-set will also be sensitive
to asymmetry in the lensing signal and variation of the deflection law with
galaxy type. A detection of either of these effects would represent an
independent confirmation that galaxies are dark matter-dominated; conversely
azimuthal symmetry of the shear signal would rule out the typically ellipsoidal
haloes predicted by most simulations of structure formation.

aims to explain large-scale dynamics without recourse to any form of dark
matter. However the theory is incomplete, lacking a relativistic counterpart,
and so makes no definite predictions about gravitational lensing. The most
obvious form that MONDian lensing might take is that photons experience twice
the deflection of massive particles moving at the speed of light, as in general
relativity (GR). In such a theory there is no general thin-lens approximation
(although one can be made for spherically-symmetric deflectors), but the
three-dimensional acceleration of photons is in the same direction as the
relativistic acceleration would be. In regimes where the deflector can
reasonably be approximated as a single point-mass (specifically low-optical
depth microlensing and weak galaxy-galaxy lensing), this naive formulation is
consistent with observations. Forthcoming galaxy-galaxy lensing data and the
possibility of cosmological microlensing have the potential to distinguish
unambiguously between GR and MOND. Some tests can also be performed with
extended deflectors, for example by using surface brightness measurements of
lens galaxies to model quasar lenses, although the breakdown of the thin-lens
approximation allows an extra degree of freedom. Nonetheless, it seems unlikely
that simple ellipsoidal galaxies can explain both constraints. Further, the
low-density universe implied by MOND must be completely dominated by the
cosmological constant (to fit microwave background observations), and such
models are at odds with the low frequency of quasar lenses. These conflicts
might be resolved by a fully consistent relativistic extension to MOND; the
alternative is that MOND is not an accurate description of the universe.

results suggest that both the lensed images may show two-sided elongation at

the lifetime of massive stars. The results confirm that, if the star formation
efficiency of subgalactic halos is close to 10%, a significant fraction of the
halo gas will be lifted out of the potential well (`blow-away'), shock the
intergalactic medium, and pollute it with metal-enriched material, a scenario
recently advocated by Madau, Ferrara & Rees (2001). The volume filling factor
of the ejecta is close to unity. Depending on the stellar distribution, we find
that less than 30% of the available SN energy is converted into kinetic energy
of the blown away material, the remainder being radiated away. It appears that
mechanical feedback is less efficient than expected from simple energetic
arguments, as off-nuclear SN explosions drive inward-propagating shocks that
tend to collect and pile up cold gas in the central regions of the host halo.

method in two steps. First we take the tight-binding (TB) parameters from the
bulk sp^{3}s^{*} TB model, extended to include the spin-orbit interaction. The
full single-particle spectra are obtained from an exact diagonalization by
using a group-theoretical treatment. The electron-hole interaction is next
introduced: Both the Coulomb (direct) and exchange terms are considered. The
high-energy excitonic transitions are studied by computing the electric dipole
transition probabilities between single-particle states, while the transition
energies are obtained by taking into account the Coulomb interaction. The fine
structure of the lowest excitonic states is analyzed by including the
electron-hole exchange interaction and the wurtzite crystal-field terms in the
exciton Hamiltonian. The latter is diagonalized in the single electron-hole
pair excitation subspace of progressively increasing size until convergence.
The peaks in the theoretical transition spectra are then used to deduce the
resonant and nonresonant Stokes shifts, which are compared with their measured
values in photoluminescence experiments. We find that the final results depend
on the crystal-field term, the relative size of the surface and the degree of
saturation of the dangling bonds. The results show a satisfactory agreement

Contrary to previous numerical treatments which are based on the initial value
formulation of general relativity on a (3-dimensional) spacelike hypersurface,
our approach deals with the full (4-dimensional) spacetime. This permits a
rigorous definition of the orbital angular velocity. Neglecting the
gravitational radiation reaction, we assume that the black holes move on closed
circular orbits, which amounts to endowing the spacetime with a helical Killing
vector. We discuss the choice of the spacetime manifold, the desired properties
of the spacetime metric, as well as the choice of the rotation state for the
black holes. As a simplifying assumption, the space 3-metric is approximated by
a conformally flat one. The problem is then reduced to solving five of the ten
Einstein equations, which are derived here, as well as the boundary conditions
on the black hole surfaces and at spatial infinity. We exhibit the remaining
five Einstein equations and propose to use them to evaluate the error induced
by the conformal flatness approximation. The orbital angular velocity of the
system is computed through a requirement which reduces to the classical virial
theorem at the Newtonian limit.

representing corotating binary black holes in circular orbits. The method is
based on the assumption of exact equilibrium. It uses the standard 3+1
decomposition of Einstein equations and conformal flatness approximation for
the 3-metric. Contrary to previous numerical approaches to this problem, we do
not solve only the constraint equations but rather a set of five equations for
the lapse function, the conformal factor and the shift vector. The orbital
velocity is unambiguously determined by imposing that, at infinity, the metric
behaves like the Schwarzschild one, a requirement which is equivalent to the
virial theorem. The numerical scheme has been implemented using multi-domain
spectral methods and passed numerous tests. A sequence of corotating black
holes of equal mass is calculated. Defining the sequence by requiring that the
ADM mass decrease is equal to the angular momentum decrease multiplied by the
orbital angular velocity, it is found that the area of the apparent horizons is
constant along the sequence. We also find a turning point in the ADM mass and
angular momentum curves, which may be interpreted as an innermost stable
circular orbit (ISCO). The values of the global quantities at the ISCO,
especially the orbital velocity, are in much better agreement with those from
third post-Newtonian calculations than with those resulting from previous
numerical approaches.

innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) configuration for these cases. While
these quasiequilibrium, conformally flat sequences of initial data sets are not
true solutions of the Einstein equations (each set, however, solves the full

intrinsic property of 4D spacetime. Our hypothesis is that singularities in 4D
are induced by the separation of spacetime from the other dimensions. We
examine this hypothesis in the context of the so-called canonical or warp
metrics in 5D. These metrics are popular because they provide a clean
separation between the extra dimension and spacetime. We show that the
spacetime section, in these metrics, inevitably becomes singular for some
finite (non-zero) value of the extra coordinate. This is true for all canonical
metrics that are solutions of the field equations in space-time-matter theory.
This is a geometrical singularity in 5D, but appears as a physical one in 4D.
At this singular hypersurface, the determinant of the spacetime metric becomes
zero and the curvature of the spacetime blows up to infinity. These results are
consistent with our hypothesis.

the uniqueness of lepton-hadron collisions at high energy, searches are
performed for electron-quark resonant states (leptoquarks or squarks in
R-parity-violating supersymmetry) or excited states of fermions. New phenomena
at a very high energy scale, manifested at present energies as effective
four-fermion contact interaction, are also investigated, including cases with
lepton-flavor violation. Finally, the status of events with a high-energy
lepton and missing transverse momentum is presented, resulting in the most
stringent constraint on the flavor-changing neutral current t-u-\gamma coupling
which could yield single-top production.

squarks in R-parity violating SUSY models. For Yukawa couplings lambda to

on the Yukawa couplings lambda for leptoquarks and lambda'_1jk for squarks, and
on beta as a function of the scalar leptoquark/squark mass.

experiments. It is shown that the proposed mechanism is realised most
convincingly in theories of the Randall- Sundrum type, where gravity couples
strongly in the TeV range. The mechanism has the potential for solving both the
solar and atmospheric neutrino problems. The smallness of neutrino masses in

energies around 30 A.GeV in the lab frame. This maximum is unique to heavy ion

  The appearance of the maximum is due to the energy dependence of the chemical
freeze-out parameters and is clearly seen as a pronounced peak in the
Wroblewski factor as a function of the incident energy as well as in the
behavior of the K+/pi+ ratio. Below 30 A.GeV strange baryons contribute
strongly because of the very large value of the chemical potential muB.
  As the energy increases, the decrease of the baryon chemical potential
coupled with only moderate increases in the associated temperature causes a
decline in the relative number of strange baryons above energies of about 30
A.GeV leading to very pronounced maxima in the Lambda/pi+ and Xi-/pi+ ratios.

  The Unruh temperature of massless quanta is derived by applying LEC to an

  Massless quanta outside a hot sphere are analyzed. A stationary spherically
symmetric local equilibrium does only exist according to LEC if the temperature
is globally constant.
  Using LEC a non-trivial stationary local equilibrium is found for rotating

parameter a one-dimensional Brownian motion running with speed $\kappa$. This

  The present paper attempts a first systematic study of SLE. It is proved that

very tail of $p_{_N}(x)$ has a Gaussian form if and only if all the random
terms are distributed according to the Gauss Law. In all other cases the tail
for $p_{_N}(x)$ differs from the Gaussian. If the variances of random terms
diverge the non-Gaussian tail is related to a Levy distribution for
$p_{_N}(x)$. However, the tail is not Gaussian even if the variances are
finite. In the latter case $p_{_N}(x)$ has two different asymptotics. At small
and moderate values of $x$ the distribution is Gaussian. At large $x$ the
non-Gaussian tail arises. The crossover between the two asymptotics occurs at
$x$ proportional to $N$. For this reason the non-Gaussian tail exists at finite
$N$ only. In the limit $N$ tends to infinity the origin of the tail is shifted
to infinity, i. e., the tail vanishes. Depending on the particular type of the
distribution of the random terms the non-Gaussian tail may decay either slower
than the Gaussian, or faster than it. A number of particular examples is
discussed in detail.

is expected to take place. Simulations of QCD on lattice at zero baryon density
indicate that the transition occurs at $T_c \sim 150-170$ MeV. The calculations
indicate that transition is likely to be second order or a cross over
phenomenon. Although the lattice simulations have not given any indication on
when the transition occurs at nonzero baryon density, the transition is
expected to occur around the densities of few times nuclear matter density.
Also, there is a strong reason to believe that the quark matter formed after
the phase transition is in colour superconducting phase. The matter densities
in the interior of neutron stars are expected to be several times the nuclear
matter density and therefore the neutron star cores may possibly consist of
quark matter. One then expects that this quark matter is formed during the
collapse of supernova. Starting with the assumption that the quark matter, when
formed consists of predominantly u and d quarks, we consider the evolution of
strange quarks by weak interactions in the present work. The reaction rates and
time required to reach the chemical equilibrium are computed here. Our
calculations show that the chemical equilibrium is reached in about $10^{-7}$
seconds. Further more during and immediately after the equilibration process
enormous amount of energy is released and copious numbers of neutrinos are
produced. We show that for reasonable models of nuclear equations of state the
amount of energy released could be as high as $10^{53}$ ergs and as many as
$10^{58}$ neutrinos may be emitted during the quark matter formation.

equilibrium state. It is explain why the second law can be broken in some
quantum systems. In the last years some authors have concluded almost at once

challenging problem of characterizing entanglement. Entanglement for a two
qubit system is reasonably well understood, however, the nature and properties
of multiple qubit systems are largely unexplored. Motivated by the importance
of such systems in quantum computing, we show that typical pure states of N
qubits are highly entangled but have decreasing amounts of pairwise
entanglement (measured using the Wootter's concurrence formula) as N increases.
Above six qubits very few states have any pairwise entanglement, and generally,
for a typical pure state of N qubits there is a sharp cut-off where its
subsystems of size m become PPT (positive partial transpose i.e., separable or
only bound entangled) around N >~ 2m + 3, based on numerical analysis up to
N=13.

A 65, 021802(R) (2002).","10.1103/PhysRevA.65.021802",,"quant-ph",,"  The cause of decoherence in a quantum system can be traced back to the
interaction with the environment. As it has been pointed out first by Dicke, in
a system of N two-level atoms where each of the atoms is individually dipole
coupled to the environment, there are collective, subradiant states, that have
no dipole coupling to photon modes, and therefore they are expected to decay
slower. This property also implies that these type of states, which form an N-1
dimensional subspace of the atomic subsytem, also decohere slower. We propose a
scheme which will create such states. First the two-level atoms are placed in a
strongly detuned cavity and one of the atoms, called the control atom is
excited. The time evolution of the coupled atom-cavity system leads to an
appropriately entangled state of the atoms. By applying subsequent laser pulses
at a well defined time instant, it is possible to drive the atomic state into
the subradiant, i. e., decoherence free subspace. Up to a certain average
number of the photons, the result is independent of the state of the cavity.
The analysis of the conditions shows that this scheme is feasible with present
day techniques achieved in atom cavity interaction experiments.

in a far-detuned optical lattice. The Lamb-Dicke regime is achieved in the
lattice direction whereas the transverse confinement is much weaker. The
employed sideband cooling method, first studied by Vuletic et al.\cite{Vule98},
uses Raman transitions between Zeeman levels and produces a spin-polarized
sample. We present a detailed study of this cooling method and investigate the
role of elastic collisions in the system. We accumulate $83(5)%$ of the atoms
in the vibrational ground state of the strongly confined motion, and elastic
collisions cool the transverse motion to a temperature of $2.8 \mu $K=$0.7
\hbar\omega_{\rm osc}/k_{\rm B}$, where $\omega_{\rm osc}$ is the oscillation
frequency in the strongly confined direction. The sample then approaches the
regime of a quasi-2D cold gas. We analyze the limits of this cooling method and
propose a dynamical change of the trapping potential as a mean of cooling the
atomic sample to still lower temperatures. Measurements of the rate of
thermalization between the weakly and strongly confined degrees of freedom are
compatible with the zero energy scattering resonance observed previously in
weak 3D traps. For the explored temperature range the measurements agree with
recent calculations of quasi-2D collisions\cite{Petr01}. Transparent analytical
models reproduce the expected behavior for $k_{\rm B}T \gg \hbar \omega_{\rm
osc}$ and also for $k_{\rm B}T \ll \hbar \omega_{\rm osc}$ where the 2D
features are prominent.
