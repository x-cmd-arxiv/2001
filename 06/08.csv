  Journal, August 2001",,"10.1086/321165",,"astro-ph",,"  The effects of the orbital diffusion of stars and clusters on the galactic
abundance gradient have been modelled. For a single generation of field stars,
the results confirm previous analyses based upon the assumption of a linear
gradient with galactocentric distance. Though the dispersion in metallicity at
a given radius grows with time, the underlying slope across the disk remains
unchanged. For a disk dominated by a discontinuity in [Fe/H] beyond the solar
circle, but no gradient within the inner or outer disk, a gradient is derived
for any sample whose galactocentric baseline overlaps the discontinuity. The
consequence of orbital diffusion is to shift the observable edge of the
transition in [Fe/H] to smaller galactocentric distance. In contrast, star
clusters of a single generation evaporate so quickly that the small surviving
sample of the oldest clusters is statistically insufficient to define any but a
linear gradient. Inclusion of multiple generations of stars and clusters with a
plausible age-metallicity relation enhances these patterns by expanding the
metallicity range at a given galactocentric distance through the inclusion of
stars with a wide range in both age and galactocentric origin. For field stars,
the metallicity distribution of stars in the solar neighborhood is virtually
indistinguishable for the two cases modelled. Because ages, abundances, and
distances can be reliably determined for clusters and any sample of clusters is
invariably dominated by clusters formed over the last 2 Gyrs, the cluster
population offers a means for finding detailed structure within the recent
galactic abundance gradient. Using clusters to extend the galactocentric
baseline would supply an additional critical test of the discontinuity.

which, in addition to the head-tail galaxies, show two extended, irregular, and
sharp-edged regions of diffuse radio emission at the cluster periphery (so
called radio relics), and a large-scale diffuse radio halo located in the
central regions of the cluster. Polarimetry of the A2256 cluster relics reveals
large-scale ordered magnetic fields which appear to trace the bright filaments
in the relics. The polarization fraction across the relics ranges from 20% -
40% with the majority of the relics polarized above the 30% level. At the
sensitivity of our current observations we place an upper limit of 20% on the
polarization of the radio halo. Low frequency VLA observations of Abell 754
reveal extended, diffuse radio (halo) emission in the cluster core region as
well as steep spectrum emission in the cluster periphery. The location,
morphology, and spectral index of the peripheral emission are consistent with
the properties of radio relics. The X-ray evidence of the ongoing mergers in
both clusters, together with the polarization properties of A2256's radio
relics supports recent suggestions of a merger-induced origin of the relic
emission. Deciphering the complex radio properties of these clusters may thus
provide the key to understanding the dynamical history of the systems.

no established theory as to why these parameters take the particular values we

the observed value of each parameter, as the only value capable of generating a
universe that can host intelligent life. In this paper, I explicitly show that
the requirement that the universe generates sun-like stars with planets does
not fix these parameters, by developing a class of cosmologies (based on the
classical `cold big-bang' model) in which some or all of the cosmological
parameters differ by orders of magnitude from the values they assume in the
standard hot big-bang cosmology, without precluding in any obvious way the
existence of intelligent life. I also give a careful discussion of the

implications of the cold big-bang model's existence for anthropic arguments
concerning specific parameters.

out to z~0.4, with scatter unchanged with respect to local samples, within the
observational errors. The intermediate redshift FP is offset with respect to
the FP of the Coma Cluster. The offset of the FP is found to increase with
redshift. The evolution of the FP is studied quantitatively with a
Bayesian-Montecarlo technique. By applying this technique, we find that the
offset of the intercept of the FP (\Delta \gamma) with respect to the local FP
increases as \Delta \gamma = \tau z with the following 68 per cent limits:
0.33<\tau<0.44 (for \Omega=1, \Omega_{\Lambda}=0) or 0.44<\tau<0.56 (for
\Omega=0.3,\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.7). In addition, we interpret the results in
terms of the evolution of the stellar populations, under the assumption of
passive evolution. In a single-burst scenario, the observed properties are
consistent with those of a stellar population formed at z>2 (for \Omega=1,
\Omega_{\Lambda}=0, H_0=50 \kms Mpc^{-1}) or 0.8<z<1.6 (for \Omega=0.3,
\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.7, H_0=65 \kms Mpc^{-1}). If a small fraction of the stellar
mass is formed in a secondary burst, the primary burst may have occurred at
higher z. Finally, the intercept and scatter of the FP found for field
early-type galaxies and for cluster data at z~0.4 are mutually consistent,
within the observational errors. If higher redshift (up to z=0.83) cluster data
are considered, the ages of the stellar populations of field early-type
galaxies inferred from a single-burst scenario are found to be marginally
smaller than the ages derived for the cluster galaxies. [shortened]

classify the Seyfert galaxies into those where the far-infrared continuum

starburst, or host galaxy.
  While AGN-dominant objects consist of comparable numbers of Seyfert 1 and 2
galaxies, starburst- and host-dominant objects consist preferentially of
Seyfert 2 galaxies. Thus, in addition to the dusty torus, the circumnuclear
starburst region and host galaxy are important in hiding the broad-line region.
  Morphologically, starburst-dominant Seyfert galaxies are of later types and
more strongly interacting than AGN-dominant Seyfert galaxies. In a later-type
galaxy, the AGN central engine has a lower Eddington luminosity, and the
gaseous content is higher. The gas is efficiently supplied to the starburst via
a galaxy-galaxy interaction. Morphologies of host-dominant Seyfert galaxies are
of various types.
  Since starbursts in Seyfert galaxies are older than those in classical
starburst galaxies, we propose an evolution from starburst to
starburst-dominant Seyfert to host-dominant Seyfert for a late-type galaxy. An
evolution from AGN-dominant Seyfert to host-dominant Seyfert is proposed for an

absolute stabiliy limit is extended by a nonlocal term describing a shear flow
parallel to the interface. In the long-wave limit considered, the flow acts
destabilizing on a planar interface. Moreover, linear stability analysis
suggests that the morphology diagram is modified by the flow near the onset of
the Mullins-Sekerka instability. Via numerical analysis, the bifurcation
structure of the system is shown to change. Besides the known hexagonal cells,
structures consisting of stripes arise. Due to its symmetry-breaking
properties, the flow term induces a lateral drift of the whole pattern, once
the instability has become active. The drift velocity is measured numerically
and described analytically in the framework of a linear analysis. At large flow
strength, the linear description breaks down, which is accompanied by a
transition to flow-dominated morphologies, described in a companion paper.
Small and intermediate flows lead to increased order in the lattice structure
of the pattern, facilitating the elimination of defects. Locally oscillating
structures appear closer to the instability threshold with flow than without.

were examined using XRD, SEM and magnetisation measurements. In contrast to the
common practice of sintering for several hours, the present results show that
there is no need for prolonged heat treatment in the fabrication of Fe-clad
MgB2 wires. A total time in the furnace of several minutes is more than enough
to form nearly pure MgB2 with high performance characteristics. The results
from Tc, Jc and Hirr show convincingly that the samples which were sintered for
3 minutes above 800 oC are as good as those sintered for longer times. In fact,
the Jc field performance for the most rapidly sintered sample is slightly
better than for all other samples. Jc of 4.5 times 10 ^5 A/cm2 in zero field
and above 10 ^5 A/cm2 in 2T at 15 K has been achieved for the best Fe-clad MgB2
wires. As a result of such a short sintering there is no need for using high
purity argon protection and it is possible to carry out the heat treatment in a
much less protective atmosphere or in air. These findings substantially
simplify the fabrication process, making it possible to have a continuous
process for fabrication and reducing the costs for large-scale production of

of the oscillator and discuss the trace the oscillator leaves in the bath. Most
of the work deals with two-level systems coupled to a bosonic bath (a
transmission line). For two-level systems with a Hamiltonian that commutes with
the total Hamiltonian (system plus coupling plus bath) the ground state is a
pure state. The energy of the system is a constant of motion. For the general
case, the energy of the two-level system fluctuates, and the ground state is
only partially coherent. A particular realization of such a two level system
consists of a mesoscopic ring with a quantum dot coupled capacitively to a
transmission line. In the presence of an Aharonov-Bohm flux this system
exhibits a persistent current. This current is a measure of the coherence of
the ground state. As a function of the coupling strength the ground state
undergoes a crossover from a state characterized by a time-averaged persistent
current which is much larger than its time-averaged mean squared fluctuations
to a state characterized by a persistent current with an average amplitude that
is much smaller than its mean squared fluctuations.

the data complexity of these variants. We show that, under the combined

sometimes quite high in the complexity hierarchies (as high as NP^PP),
depending on the characteristics of the plausibility index. However, we are
able to single out some tractable and interesting metaquerying cases (whose
combined complexity is LOGCFL-complete). As for the data complexity of

problem of initial singularity characterised by infinite material density,

of such a phase of the universe may be considered to be one of the major
drawbacks of Einstein's field equations. To some extent inflation models
ameliorate this. In the present work we postulate that whenever matter
(radiation) arises in flat spacetime, it introduces curvature and causes a
repulsive interaction to develop. A modified energy momentum tensor is
introduced towards this end, which invokes the temperature, entropy and a
cosmic scalar field. This redefinition of the energy momentum distribution when
applied to the early universe dynamics has the effect of producing a
non-singular initial behaviour. the repulsive interaction introduces some
features of an accelarating universe. In this model all cosmological parameters
are mathematically well behaved. There is no flatness problem. Temperature at

decay amplitude. Annihilation topologies are shown to be power suppressed. In
some cases they are nevertheless calculable. The approach is similar to the
framework of QCD factorization that has recently been formulated for two-body
non-leptonic B decays. These results allow us, for the first time, to compute
exclusive b -> s(d) gamma decays systematically beyond the leading logarithmic

order in QCD and to leading order in the heavy-quark limit. Phenomenological
implications for various observables of interest are discussed, including
direct CP violation, and isospin and U-spin breaking effects.

together within a single puzzle board framed by supersymmetric unification,

successfully describes the masses and mixings of all fermions, including the

updated study of proton decay is carried out within this framework, which shows

0 to 2 \pi) with a corresponding large B soft breaking mass phase (of size ~<
0.5 with sign fixed by the experimental sign of a_{\mu}). The dependence of the
B phase on the other SUSY parameters, gaugino mass m_{1/2}, \tan \beta, A_0, is
examined. The lower bound of a_{\mu} determines the upper bound of m_{1/2}. It
is shown analytically how the existence of a non-zero Bino phase reduces this
upper bound (which would correspondingly lower the SUSY mass spectra). The
experimental upper bound on d_e determines the range of allowed phases, and the
question of whether the current bound on d_e requires any fine tuning is
investigated. At the electroweak scale, the phases have to be specified to
within a few percent. At the GUT scale, however, the B phase requires fine
tuning below the 1% level over parts of the parameter space for low m_{1/2},
and if the current experimental bound on d_e were reduced by only a factor of
3-4, fine tuning below 1% would occur at both the electroweak and GUT scale
over large regions of the parameter space. All accelerator constraints (m_h >

$\partial^3 g_{\mu \nu} \partial g_{\alpha \beta}$, $\partial^2 g_{\mu \nu}

much the same way as the Einstein-Hilbert action describes the only consistent
manner to make a Pauli-Fierz massless spin-2 field self-interact with no more
than 2 derivatives. No a priori requirement of invariance under diffeomorphisms
is imposed: this follows automatically from consistency. (ii) We then turn to
""multi-Weyl graviton"" theories. We show the impossibility to introduce
cross-interactions between the different types of Weyl gravitons if one
requests that the action reduces, in the free limit, to a sum of linearized
Weyl actions. However, if different free limits are authorized, cross-couplings
become possible. An explicit example is given. We discuss also how the results

to \N=4 superconformal SU(N) Yang-Mills theory (SCYM), the Maldacena conjecture
and the theorem of Rehren. While the Maldacena dual is conjectured to be a
non-perturbative string theory for large string coupling $g_s$ and small $N$,
the Rehren dual is an ordinary quantum field theory on $AdS_5$ for all values
of the parameters. We argue that as a result, if we accept the Maldacena
conjecture, one of the following statements must be true: 1) SCYM does not
satisfy the axioms of algebraic quantum field theory for finite $N$ because its
observables do not obey the causal structure of conformal Minkowski space;. 2)
String theory on $AdS_5 \times S^5$ is not a quantum theory of gravity in 10
dimensions because it is dual to an ordinary quantum field theory on $AdS_5$
whose causal structure remains fixed for all values of its couplings; or 3)
there is no consistent quantisation of string theory on $AdS_5 \times S^5$ for
finite string scale $l_s$ and $g_s$.
  In evaluating the evidence for each of these conclusions we point out that
many of the tests of the Maldacena conjecture can be explained by a weaker form
of an $AdS/CFT$ correspondence.

simultaneous current-voltage (I-V) and differential conductance $\delta

mechanically very stable up to bias voltage $V_b\sim0.6V$ and have a life time
of a few $minutes$. Facilitated by a shape function data analysis technique
which finger-prints electronic properties of the atomic device, our data show
clearly differential conductance fluctuations with an amplitude $>1%$ at room
temperature, and a nonlinear I-V characteristics. To understand the transport
features of these atomic scale conductors, we carried out {\it ab initio}
calculations on various Au atomic wires. The theoretical results demonstrate
that transport properties of these systems crucially depend on the electronic
properties of the scattering region, the leads, and most importantly the
interaction of the scattering region with the leads. For ideal, clean Au
contacts, the theoretical results indicate a linear I-V behavior for bias
voltage $V_b<0.5V$. When sulfur impurities exist at the contact junction,
nonlinear I-V curves emerge due to a tunnelling barrier established in the
presence of the S atom. The most striking observation is that even a single S
atom can cause a qualitative change of the I-V curve from linear to nonlinear.
A quantitatively favorable comparison between experimental data and theoretical
results is obtained. We also report other results concerning quantum transport

force is its strong dependence on shape, switching from attractive to repulsive
as function of the size, geometry and topology of the boundary. Thus the
Casimir force is a direct manifestation of the boundary dependence of quantum
vacuum.
  We discuss in depth the general structure of the infinities in the field
theory which are removed by a combination of zeta-functional regularization and
heat kernel expansion. Different representations for the regularized vacuum
energy are given. The Casimir energies and forces in a number of configurations
of interest to applications are calculated. We stress the development of the
Casimir force for real media including effects of nonzero temperature, finite
conductivity of the boundary metal and surface roughness. Also the combined
effect of these important factors is investigated in detail on the basis of
condensed matter physics and quantum field theory at nonzero temperature.

modern precision experiments. The latter are accurately compared with the
theoretical results for real media.
