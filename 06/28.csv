in the far-infrared (FIR). We present measurements by the Infrared Space
Observatory Long Wavelength Spectrometer of seven lines from neutral and
ionized ISM of 60 normal, star-forming galaxies. The galaxy sample spans a
range in properties such as morphology, FIR colors (indicating dust
temperature), and FIR/Blue ratios (indicating star-formation activity and
optical depth). In two-thirds of the galaxies in this sample, the [CII] line is
proportional to FIR dust continuum. The other one-third show a smooth decline
in [CII]/FIR with increasing F60/F100 and FIR/B, spanning a range of a factor
of more than 50. Two galaxies, at the warm and active extreme of the range have
[CII]/FIR < 2 \times 10^{-4} (3-sigma upper limit). This is due to increased
positive grain charge in the warmer and more active galaxies, which leads to
less efficient heating by photoelectrons from dust grains. The ratio of the two
principal photodissociation region (PDR) cooling lines [CII]/[OI] shows a tight
correlation with F60/F100, indicating that both gas and dust temperatures
increase together. We derive a theoretical scaling between [NII] and [CII] from
ionized gas and use it to separate [CII] emission from neutral PDRs and ionized
gas. Comparison of PDR models of Kaufman et al. (1999) with observed ratios of
(a) [OI]/[CII] and ([CII]+[OI])/FIR and (b) [OI]/FIR and F60/F100 yields far-UV
flux G0 and gas density n. The derived G0 scales as n to the power 1.4. We
interpret this correlation as arising from Stromgren sphere scalings if much of
the line and continuum luminosity arises near star-forming regions. The
differences in G0 and n may be due to differences in the physical properties of
the star-forming clouds.(Short abstract)

clustering environment could either be the result of local conditions at
formation or subsequent environmental effects as larger scale structures draw
together galaxies whose stellar mass is largely in place. At z~0.4 the
co-moving galaxy correlation length, r_0, measured in the CNOC2 sample is
strongly color dependent, rising from 2/h Mpc to nearly 10/h Mpc as the
volume-limited subsamples range from blue to red. The luminosity dependence of
r_0 at z~0.4 is weak below L_ast although there is an upturn at high luminosity
where its interpretation depends on separating it from the r_0-color relation.
The dominant effect of the group environment on star formation is seen in the
radial gradient of the mean galaxy colors which on the average become redder
than the field toward the group centers. The redder-than-field trend applies to
groups with a line-of-sight velocity dispersion, sigma_1>150 kms. There is an
indication, somewhat statistically insecure, that the high luminosity galaxies
in groups with sigma_1<125 kms become bluer toward the group center. We
conclude that the higher velocity dispersion groups largely act to suppress
star formation relative to the less clustered field, leading to ``embalmed''
galaxies. The tidal fields within the groups appear to be a strong candidate
for the physical source of the reduction of star formation in group galaxies
relative to field. Tides operate effectively at all velocity dispersions to
remove gas rich companions and low density gas in galactic halos. Given that
much of the field population is in groups we suggest that this suppression may
be the dominant galaxy evolution force at low redshift.

in the interstellar medium (ISM) in the plane of the Galaxy, even on scales
under 50 pc. Nevertheless, multi-phase models of the ISM assume at least
locally isobaric gas. The pressure then determines the density reached by gas
cooling to stable thermal equilibrium. We use two different sets of numerical
models of the ISM to examine the consequences of supernova driving for
interstellar pressures. The first set of models is hydrodynamical, and uses
adaptive mesh refinement to allow computation of a 1 x 1 x 20 kpc section of a
stratified galactic disk. The second set of models is magnetohydrodynamical,
using an independent code framework, and examines a 200 pc cubed periodic
domain threaded by magnetic fields. Both of these models show broad pressure
distributions with roughly log-normal functional forms produced by both shocks
and rarefaction waves, rather than the power-law distributions predicted by
previous work, with rather sharp thermal pressure gradients. The width of the
distribution of the logs of pressure in gas with log T < 3.9 is proportional to
the rms Mach number in that gas, while the distribution in hotter gas is
broader, but not so broad as would be predicted by the Mach numbers in that
gas. Individual parcels of gas reach widely varying points on the thermal
equilibrium curve: no unique set of phases is found, but rather a
dynamically-determined continuum of densities and temperatures. Furthermore, a
substantial fraction of the gas remains entirely out of thermal equilibrium.
Our results appear consistent with observations of interstellar pressures, and
suggest that the pressures observed in molecular clouds may be due to ram
pressure rather than gravitational confinement.

components of the Blazar class, namely, the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars and the
BL Lacertae objects, and yields all their distinctive features in a correlated
way. In this view, both type of sources are centered on a supermassive Kerr
hole close to maximal spin that produces a relativistic jet observed close to
the axis, and on the associated accretion disk that emits more isotropically.
But the FSRQs are energized by accretion at rates dm/dt ~ 1, and are dominated
by the disk components (thermal and electrodynamic jet-like component) which
provide outputs in excess of L ~ 10^46 erg/s. On the other hand, accretion
levels dm/dt << 1 are enough to energize the BL Lacs; here the radiation is
highly non-thermal and the power partly contributed by the rotational energy of
the central Kerr hole, with the latter and the disk together sustaining L ~
10^44 erg/s in the jet frame for several Gyrs. If so, we expect the BL Lacs to
show quite different evolutionary signatures from the FSRQs, and in particular,
number counts close to the Euclidean shape, or flatter if the sources make a
transition to the BL Lac from a FSRQ mode. In addition, for lower dm/dt along
the BMS, we expect the large scale electric fields to be less screened out, and
to accelerate fewer particles to higher energies with non-thermal radiations at
higher frequencies; so in moving from FSRQs to BL Lacs these non-thermal
radiations will peak at frequencies inversely correlated with the disk output.
For the BL Lacs such dependence implies increased scatter when one tries a
correlation with the total ouput. At its endpoint, the BMS suggests widespread
objects that are radiatively silent, but still efficient in accelerating cosmic
rays to ultra high energies.

4258 and infers the nature of the so called ``anomalous arms'' in this galaxy.
The anomalous arms dominate the X-ray image; diffuse X-ray emission from the
``plateaux'' regions, seen in radio and H$\alpha$ imaging, is also found. X-ray
spectra have been obtained at various locations along the anomalous arms and
are well described by thermal (mekal) models with kT in the range 0.37 - 0.6
keV. The previously known kpc-scale radio jets are surrounded by cocoons of hot
X-ray emitting gas for the first 350 pc of their length. The radio jets, seen
in previous VLBA and VLA observations, propagate perpendicular to the compact
nuclear gas disk (imaged in water vapor maser emission). The angle between the
jets and the rotation axis of the galactic disk is 60$^{\circ}$. The jets shock
the normal interstellar gas along the first 350 pc of their length, causing the
hot, X-ray emitting cocoons noted above. At a height of z = 175 pc from the
disk plane, the jets exit the normal gas disk and then propagate though the low
density halo until they reach ``hot spots'' (at 870 pc and 1.7 kpc from the
nucleus), which are seen in radio, optical line and X-ray emission. These jets
must drive mass motions into the low density halo gas. This high velocity halo
gas impacts on the dense galactic gas disk and shock heats it along and around
a ``line of damage'', which is the projection of the jets onto the galactic gas
disk as viewed down the galaxy disk rotation axis. However, because NGC 4258 is
highly inclined ($i$ = 64$^{\circ}$), the ``line of damage'' projects on the
sky in a different direction to the jets themselves. We calculate the expected
p.a. of the ``line of damage'' on the sky and find that it coincides with the
anomalous arms to within 2$^{\circ}$. (Abstract truncated).

be particularly favored over the rest. When combined with other information,
however (e.g., spectra, total energetics, and the historical age of the

the others, and we use it for illustrative purposes in discussing the possible

  ApJ Letters",,"10.1086/322991",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a composite 1-10 keV Seyfert 2 X-ray spectrum, derived from ASCA
observations of a distance-limited sample of nearby galaxies. All 29 observed
objects were detected. Above ~3 keV, the composite spectrum is inverted,
confirming that Seyfert 2 galaxies as a class have the spectral properties
necessary to explain the flat shape of the cosmic X-ray background spectrum.
Integrating the composite spectrum over redshift, we find that the total
emission from Seyfert 2 galaxies, combined with the expected contribution from
unabsorbed type 1 objects, provides an excellent match to the spectrum and
intensity of the hard X-ray background. The principal uncertainty in this
procedure is the cosmic evolution of the Seyfert 2 X-ray luminosity function.
Separate composite spectra for objects in our sample with and without polarized
broad optical emission lines are also presented.

equilibrium using Fokker-Planck models and self-consistent N-body models. In
particular, we focused on the growth of a common halo, which is a cluster-wide
halo formed by matter stripped from galaxies, and the development of a central
density cusp. The Fokker-Planck models include the effects of two-body
gravitational encounters both between galaxies and between galaxies and common
halo particles. The effects of tidal mass stripping from the galaxies due to
close galaxy-galaxy encounters and accompanying dissipation of the orbital
kinetic energies of the galaxies were also taken into account in the
Fokker-Planck models. We find that the results of the Fokker-Planck models are
in excellent agreement with those of the N-body models regarding the growth of
the common halo mass and the evolution of the cluster density profiles. In the
central region of the cluster, a shallow density cusp, approximated by $\rho
(r) \propto r^{-\alpha}$ ($\alpha \sim$ 1), develops. This shallow cusp results
from the combined effects of two-body relaxation and tidal stripping. The cusp
steepness, $\alpha$, weakly depends on the relative importance of the tidal
stripping. When the effect of stripping is important, the central velocity
dispersion decreases as the central density increases and, consequently, a
shallow ($\alpha <2$) cusp is formed. In the limit of no stripping, usual
gravothermal core collapse occurs, i.e. the central velocity dispersion
increases as the central density increases with a steep ($\alpha >2$) cusp
left. We conclude from our consideration of the origin of the cusp demonstrated
here that shallow cusps should develop in real galaxy clusters.

beam over a 288 MHz bandwidth centred on 1374 MHz. Receiver and data
acquisition systems are described in some detail. For pulsar periods in the
range 0.1 - 2 s and dispersion measures of less than 300 cm^{-3} pc, the
nominal limiting flux density of the survey is about 0.2 mJy. At shorter or
longer periods or higher dispersions, the sensitivity is reduced. Timing
observations are carried out for pulsars discovered in the survey for 12 - 18
months after confirmation to obtain accurate positions, spin parameters,
dispersion measures, pulse shapes and mean flux densities. The survey is
proving to be extremely successful, with more than 600 pulsars discovered so
far. We expect that, when complete, this one survey will come close to finding
as many pulsars as all previous pulsar surveys put together. The newly
discovered pulsars tend to be young, distant and of high radio luminosity. They
will form a valuable sample for studies of pulsar emission properties, the
Galactic distribution and evolution of pulsars, and as probes of interstellar
medium properties. This paper reports the timing and pulse shape parameters for
the first 100 pulsars timed at Parkes, including three pulsars with periods of
less than 100 ms which are members of binary systems. These results are briefly
compared with the parameters of the previously known population.

halo, based on the currently favored cold dark matter (CDM) theory of galaxy
formation. Our numerical models, taking into account both dynamical and
chemical evolution processes in a consistent manner, are aimed at explaining
observed structure and kinematics of the stellar halo in the context of
hierarchical galaxy formation. The main results of the present simulations are
summarized as follows. (1) Basic physical processes involved in the formation
of the stellar halo, composed of metal-deficient stars with [Fe/H] $\le$ -1.0,
are described by both dissipative and dissipationless merging of subgalactic
clumps and their resultant tidal disruption in the course of gravitational
contraction of the Galaxy at high redshift ($z$ $>$ 1). (2) The simulated halo
has the density profile similar to the observed power-law form of $\rho (r)$
$\sim$ $r^{-3.5}$, and has also the similar metallicity distribution to the
observations. The halo virtually shows no radial gradient for stellar ages and
only small gradient for metallicities. (3) The dual nature of the halo, i.e.,
its inner flattened and outer spherical density distribution, is reproduced, at
least qualitatively, by the present model. The outer spherical halo is formed
via essentially dissipationless merging of small subgalactic clumps, whereas
the inner flattened one is formed via three different mechanisms, i.e.,
dissipative merging between larger, more massive clumps, adiabatic contraction
due to the growing Galactic disk, and gaseous accretion onto the equatorial
plane.

redshift, resulting from the evolution of the ionising background and the
Hubble expansion. The contribution of quasars (QSOs) and galaxies to the
HI-ionising UV background has been estimated. The QSOs emissivity is derived
from recent fits of their luminosity function. The galaxy emissivity is
computed using a stellar population synthesis model, with a star-formation
history scaled on observations of faint galaxies at lambda <= 1500 A. We allow
for three values of the fraction of ionising photons that can escape the
interstellar medium, f_esc=0.05, 0.1 and 0.4. The Intergalactic Medium is
modelled as made of purely-absorbing clouds with the distribution in redshift
and column density obtained from QSOs absorption lines. For the adopted values
of f_esc, the contribution of galaxies to the ionising UV background is
comparable or greater than that of QSOs. Accounting for the contribution of
clouds to the UV emission, all models with f_esc <~ 0.1 provide an ionising
flux compatible with local and high-z determination, including those with a
pure QSOs background. The observed z ~ 1 break in the evolution can be better
explained by a dominant contribution from galaxies. We find that models in
Lambda-cosmology with Omega_matter=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7 describe the flat
absorbers evolution for z <~ 1.0 better than models for Omega_matter=1.0.

the structure of thin accretion discs. The magnetic field energy is here
assumed to be in balance with the thermal energy of the accretion flow. The
vertical magnetic field, its toroidal component B^tor at the disc surface (due
to different rotation rates between disc and its magnetosphere), the turbulent
magnetic Prandtl number and the viscosity-alpha are the key parameters of our
model. Inside the corotation radius for rather small B^tor the resulting
inclination angle i of the magnetic field lines to the disc surface normal can
exceed the critical value 30^\circ (required to launch cold jets) even for
small magnetic Prandtl numbers of order unity. The self-consistent
consideration of both magnetic field and accretion flow demonstrates a weak
dependence of the inclination (``dragging'') angle on the magnetic Prandtl
number for given surface density but a strong dependence on the toroidal field
component at the disc surface.
  A magnetic disc is thicker than a nonmagnetic one for typical parameter
values. The accretion rate can be strongly amplified by large B^tor and small
magnetic Prandtl number. On the other hand, for given accretion rate the
magnetised disc is less massive than the standard-alpha disc. The surface
values of the toroidal magnetic fields which are necessary to induce
considerably high values for the inclination angle are much smaller than
expected and are of order 10^-3 of the imposed vertical field. As the innermost
part of the disc produces the largest B^tor, the largest radial inclination can
be expected also there. The idea is therefore supported that the cold jets are
launched only in the central disc area.

interactions pushes the system toward a regime of two coexisting phases: a low

rise to paramagnetic or antiferromagnetic domains depending on temperature.
Employing the above-mentioned variational scheme, in this paper spectral and

pseudogap in the excitation spectrum of the system. Then the conductivity
spectra are characterized by a transfer of spectral weight from high to low

integrate association rule mining with database systems. In this paper, we
describe a seamless integration scheme for database queries and association
rule discovery using a common query optimizer for both. Query trees of
expressions in an extended algebra are used for internal representation in the
optimizer. The algebraic representation is flexible enough to deal with
constrained association rule queries and other variations of association rule

complex tasks in data mining. It paves the way for making use of existing
algorithms for constructing query plans in the optimization process. How the

that the main differential equation, which is formally singular at lowest order

motivated way to regularize the problem is to include higher order terms. This
allows us to develop a practical approach for solving the problem and we
provide results that support earlier conclusions obtained for uniform density
stars. In particular, we show that there will exist a single r-mode for each
permissible combination of $l$ and $m$. We discuss these results and provide
some caveats regarding their usefulness for estimates of
gravitational-radiation reaction timescales. The close connection between the
seemingly singular relativistic r-mode problem and issues arising because of
the presence of corotation points in differentially rotating stars is also
clarified.

that we can ignore this term in the discussion of gauge independence while
varying of the gauge parameter in Lorentz-type covariant gauges is an exception
rather than a rule . We show that generally gauge-independence requires that
the epsilon-term has to be varied with alpha. We further show that if we make a
naive use of the epsilon term -i\int d^{4}x[{1/2}A^{2}-\bar{c}c]) (that is
appropriate for the Feynman gauge) for general interpolating gauges with
arbitrary parameter values [i.e.alpha], we cannot preserve gauge independence

use of an epsilon-term, we develop serious pathology in the path-integral as
alpha is/are varied. We point out that correct way to fix the epsilon-term in a
path-integral in a non-Lorentz gauge is by connecting the path-integral to the
Lorentz-gauge path-integral with correct epsilon-term as has been done using

can be exactly solved in two dimensions. In the presence of a boundary, with
the so-called method of images it is possible to study the surface critical
behaviour of these systems, and the conformal boundary conditions can be
related to the bulk operator content of the theory. After an overview of the
basic concepts of bulk and boundary conformal field theory, we present an
explicit calculation of some two-point correlation functions in Virasoro
minimal models with boundary. In the second part of the thesis, we summarize
the known results about perturbed conformal field theories, which describe the
dynamics of systems away from the critical point. We concentrate on cases in
which the off-critical massive field theory is integrable, with a corresponding
purely elastic and factorized scattering theory, focusing our attention on the
bootstrap approach. We also present the basic properties of affine Toda field
theories, whose S-matrices are closely related to the ones of some perturbed
minimal models. In the presence of a boundary, assuming that the boundary
conditions are compatible with integrability, the scattering theory is still
elastic and factorized. The analytic structure of the reflection matrix encodes
the boundary spectrum of the theory, in the light of a bootstrap approach
analogous to the bulk one. Starting from two kinds of known reflection
amplitudes, we have performed a detailed study of the boundary bound states
structure for the three E_{n} affine Toda field theories and for the
corresponding perturbed minimal models.

shown that in both cases the corresponding Hamiltonians are given as sums of
two well defined operators. Each of them is bilinear and diagonal with respect
to either fermion, or boson (current) creation-annihilation operators. As a
result the quantization procedure needs no any space cut-off and can be
performed on the whole axis. Existence of the solitonic states in the Hilbert

this approach. As a by-product it is also demonstrated that the dispersionless
KdV is uniquely and explicitly solvable in the quantum case.

from the individual sequence concentrations. For finite populations, the
position of the error threshold is very sensitive to the influence from parent
genotypes. In addition to biological applications, our model is important for
understanding the dynamics of self-replicating computer programs.

the theory of angular correlation in nuclear physics. An expression is obtained
for this angular correlation function by a statistical method which makes use
of the density and efficiency operators. The latter takes care of the
attenuation of the probability of detection of an electrons due to the
geometrical properties of the detector. Theoretical values of the angular

revise the main properties of these operators in regard to its Lie group
properties, how two of them can be combined to yield another operator of the

the paper we show how this procedure works extremely well for the Time
Dependent Quantum Harmonic Oscillator. The issue of the systematic construction
of Quantum Canonical Transformations is also discussed along the lines of
Dirac, Wigner and Schwinger ideas and to the more recent work by Lee. The main
conclusion is that the Classical Phase Space Transformation can be maintained
in the operator formalism but the construction of the Quantum Canonical
Transformation is not clearly related to the Classical Generating Function of a
Classical Canonical Transformation. We propose the road of Squeezing Operators
rather than the old one attached to Quantum Operators constructed under the
guideline of the exponential of the Classical Generating Function.

an example we study chaotic behavior of the 2-D anharmonic oscillator and
compare classical with quantum chaos. Moreover, we study quantum chaos as
function of temperature (the classical system can be considered as the limit
