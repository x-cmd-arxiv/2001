believed to be the mechanism producing the majority of cosmic ray antiprotons.
Due to the kinematics of the process they are created with a nonzero momentum;
the characteristic spectral shape with a maximum at ~2 GeV and a sharp decrease
towards lower energies makes antiprotons a unique probe of models for particle
propagation in the Galaxy and modulation in the heliosphere. On the other hand,
accurate calculation of the secondary antiproton flux provides a ``background''
for searches for exotic signals from the annihilation of supersymmetric
particles and primordial black hole evaporation. Recently new data with large
statistics on both low and high energy antiproton fluxes have become available
which allow such tests to be performed. We use our propagation code GALPROP to
calculate interstellar cosmic-ray propagation for a variety of models. We show
that there is no simple model capable of accurately describing the whole
variety of data: boron/carbon and sub-iron/iron ratios, spectra of protons,
helium, antiprotons, positrons, electrons, and diffuse gamma rays. We find that
only a model with a break in the diffusion coefficient plus convection can
reproduce measurements of cosmic-ray species, and the reproduction of primaries
(p, He) can be further improved by introducing a break in the primary injection
spectra. For our best-fit model we make predictions of proton and antiproton
fluxes near the Earth for different modulation levels and magnetic polarity
using a steady-state drift model of propagation in the heliosphere.

many years, astronomers have promised that the study of pulsating white dwarfs
would ultimately lead to useful information about the physics of matter under
extreme conditions of temperature and pressure. The optimization approach
developed in this dissertation has allowed us to finally make good on that

empirically determine that the central oxygen abundance in GD 358 is 84 +/- 3

universe. In this review we summarise some of the remarkable progress in this
field over the past few years. While the nature of the GRB progenitors is still
unsettled, it now appears likely that at least some bursts originate in
explosions of very massive stars, or at least occur in or near the regions of
massive star formation. The physics of the burst afterglows is reasonably well
understood, and has been tested and confirmed very well by the observations.
Bursts are found to be beamed, but with a broad range of jet opening angles;
the mean gamma-ray energies after the beaming corrections are ~ 10^51 erg.
Bursts are associated with faint <R> ~ 25 mag) galaxies at cosmological
redshifts, with <z> ~ 1. The host galaxies span a range of luminosities and
morphologies, but appear to be broadly typical for the normal, actively
star-forming galaxy populations at comparable redshifts and magnitudes. Some of
the challenges for the future include: the nature of the short bursts and
possibly other types of bursts and transients; use of GRBs to probe the
obscured star formation in the universe, and possibly as probes of the very
early universe; and their detection as sources of high-energy particles and
gravitational waves.

required to accommodate the strong lensing constraints. A massive structure to
the north-west of the lens system, suggested from a weak-lensing analysis of
the field, is included in the model. The lensed source is an X-ray bright
active galaxy at z=3.273 with a central bright optical continuum core and
strong narrow emission lines, suggestive of a type-II quasar. The EVN 5-GHz
radio maps show a radio-jet structure with at least two compact subcomponents.
We propose that the diamond caustic crosses the counter-jet of the radio
source, so that part of the counter-jet, host galaxy and narrow-line emission
regions are quadruply imaged. The remainder of the radio source, including the
core, is doubly imaged. Our lens model predicts a very high magnification
(mu~300) at the bightness peaks of the inner two radio components of complex C.
If the jet exhibits relativistic velocities on micro-arsecond scales, it might
result in apparent hyperluminal motion. However, the lack of strong radio
variability and the peaked radio spectrum imply that these motions need not be
present in the source. Our model furthermore implies that the optical spectrum
of C' can only show features of the AGN and its host galaxy.

has not yet been solved. Even before we are able to work out the details of a
complete theory, however, we do know some important qualitative features to be
expected in any quantum theory. Fluctuations of the metric, for example, are
expected and are associated with fluctuations of the lightcone. Lightcone
fluctuations affect the arrival time of signals from distant sources in
potentially measurable ways, broadening the spectra. In this paper, we start
with a thermal spectrum and derive the form of spectral changes expected in a
wide class of QGTs. We apply these results, valid for any thermal spectrum, to
the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The CMB offers two advantages: (1)
deviations from a thermal spectrum are well constrained, and (2) the radiation
emanates from the most distant source of light, the surface of last scattering.
We use existing CMB data to derive an upper bound on the value of $\Delta t,$
the mean spread in arrival times due to metric fluctuations: ${\Delta t} < 2.1
\times 10^{-14}$ s at the 95% confidence limit. This limit applies to a wide
range of QGTs, and falsifies those predicting a larger spread in arrival times.
We find this limit rules out at least one QGT, the 5-dimensional theory in
which the ""extra"" dimension is flat. Tests of other models may also be
possible, depending on the results of calculations to predict values of \Delta
t,$ and also a second time scale, $\tau_c,$ the correlation time, which is the
characteristic time scale of the metric fluctuations. We show that stronger
limits on the value of $\Delta t,$ hence on lightcone fluctuations, can likely
be derived through observations of of higher-T sources, e.g., in the X-ray and
gamma-ray regimes.

is not at z_{abs}=0.312, then the metallicity is still constrained to be less

metallicity is insensitive to ionization, inclusion of an atom in a molecule,

consistent with the oxygen abundance of 30% solar derived from optical nebular

MAP data at 90 GHz (0.3 deg FWHM resolution smoothed) show that foreground
effects on the correlation function are small compared with cosmic variance.
However, the Galactic emission, even just from the region with |b| > 20 deg,
significantly affects the topology of CMB anisotropy, causing a negative genus
shift non-Gaussianity signal. Given the expected level of cosmic variance, this
effect can be effectively reduced by subtracting existing Galactic foreground
emission models from the observed data. IRAS and DIRBE far-infrared
extragalactic sources have little effect on the CMB anisotropy. Radio point
sources raise the amplitude of the correlation function considerably on scales
below 0.5 deg. Removal of bright radio sources above a 5 \sigma detection limit
effectively eliminates this effect. Radio sources also result in a positive
genus curve asymmetry (significant at 2 \sigma) on 0.5 deg scales. Accurate
radio point source data is essential for an unambiguous detection of CMB
anisotropy non-Gaussianity on these scales. Non-Gaussianity of cosmological
origin can be detected from the foreground-subtracted CMB anisotropy map at the

12CO 3-2 is optically thick but that 13CO 3-2 is optically thin or at most
moderately thick. The 13CO 3-2 lines have been used to estimate the cold gas

masses are factors of 10-200 lower than those deduced from 1.3 millimeter dust

The warm gas is typically 1-10 % of the total mass deduced from millimeter
continuum emission, but can increase up to 100% or more for the debris-disk
objects. Thus, residual molecular gas may persist into the debris-disk phase.
No significant evolution in the H2, CO or dust masses is found for stars with

fluctuations dominate, thereby reversing the sign of the interaction. At this
point ($\delta = \delta_{SC}$), the theory is supersymmetric at short distances
and, as a consequence, the leading order results are not modified by radiative
corrections. The critical doping parameter for the onset of superconductivity
at T=0 is obtained and found to be a universal constant determined by the shape
of the Fermi surface. Our theoretical values for $\delta_{SC}$ are in good
agreement with the experiment for both LSCO and YBCO.

electronic inhomogeneity, i.e. nano-scale spatial variations of the local
density of states (LDOS) and the superconducting energy gap, in the high-Tc
superconductor BSCCO. Based on the experimental findings we conjectured that
the inhomogeneity arises from variations in local oxygen doping level and may
be generic of doped Mott insulators which behave rather unconventionally in
screening the dopant ionic potentials at atomic scales comparable to the short
coherence length. Here, we provide theoretical support for this picture. We
study a doped Mott insulator within a generalized t-J model, where doping is
accompanied by ionic Coulomb potentials centered in the BiO plane. We calculate
the LDOS spectrum, the integrated LDOS, and the local superconducting gap, make
detailed comparisons to experiments, and find remarkable agreement with the
experimental data. We emphasize the unconventional screening in a doped Mott
insulator and show that nonlinear screening dominates at nano-meter scales
which is the origin of the electronic inhomogeneity. It leads to strong
inhomogeneous redistribution of the local hole density and promotes the notion
of a local doping concentration. We find that the inhomogeneity structure
manifests itself at all energy scales in the STM tunneling differential
conductance, and elucidate the similarity and the differences between the data
obtained in the constant tunneling current mode and the same data normalized to
reflect constant tip-to-sample distance. We also discuss the underdoped case
where nonlinear screening of the ionic potential turns the spatial electronic
structure into a percolative mixture of patches with smaller pairing gaps
embedded in a background with larger gaps to single particle excitations.

statistical models. The density of states is modified at each step when the
energy level is visited to produce a flat histogram. By carefully controlling
the modification factor, we allow the density of states to converge to the true
value very quickly, even for large systems. This algorithm is especially useful
for complex systems with a rough landscape since all possible energy levels are
visited with the same probability. In this paper, we apply our algorithm to
both 1st and 2nd order phase transitions to demonstrate its efficiency and
accuracy. We obtained direct simulational estimates for the density of states
for two-dimensional ten-state Potts models on lattices up to $200 \times 200 $

a 3D $\pm J$ spin glass model we estimate the internal energy and entropy at

landscape in order-parameter space. Preliminary data suggest that the glass
transition temperature is about 1.2 and that better estimates can be obtained

duality violation is particularly restricted in the total semileptonic widths.
This explains its strong suppression in concrete dynamical estimates. We
analyze the origin of the suppression factors in a model-independent setting,
including a fresh perspective on the Small Velocity expansion. A new
potentially significant mechanism for violation of local duality in
\Gamma_sl(B) is analyzed. Yet we conclude that the amount of duality violation
in \Gamma_sl(B) must be safely below the half percent level, with realistic
estimates being actually much smaller. Violation of local duality in
\Gamma_sl(B) is thus far below the level relevant to phenomenology. We also
present a cautionary note on the B->D^* decay amplitude at zero recoil and show
that it is much more vulnerable to violations of quark-hadron duality than
\Gamma_sl(B). A critical review of some recent literature is given. We point

MSSM corresponding to the quasi-fixed point conditions shows that the mass of
the lightest Higgs boson in this case does not exceed $94\pm 5\text{GeV}$. It
means that a substantial part of the parameter space of the MSSM is practically
excluded by existing experimental data from LEP II. In the NMSSM the upper
bound on the lightest Higgs boson mass reaches its maximum in the strong Yukawa
coupling regime, when Yukawa constants are considerably larger the gauge ones
on the Grand Unification scale. In this paper a particle spectrum in a simple
modification of NMSSM which leads to a self-consistent solution in the
considered region of the parameter space is studied. This model allows one to
get $m_h\sim 125\text{GeV}$ even for comparatively low values of $\tan\beta\ge
1.9$. For an analysis of the Higgs boson spectrum and neutralino spectrum a
method for diagonalisation of mass matrices proposed formerly is used. The mass
of the lightest Higgs boson in this model does not exceed $130.5\pm
3.5\text{GeV}$.

D-term contributions to scalar masses arising from the breakdown of SO(10),
Yukawa coupling unification only to 30% can be achieved in models with a
positive superpotential Higgs mass. The superparticle mass spectrum is highly
constrained, and yields relatively light top squarks and charginos.
Surprisingly, the pattern of GUT scale soft SUSY breaking masses are close to

illustrate these topics. Since the main new observable at RHIC relative to SPS
is jet quenching, I elaborate on this ``tomographic'' probe of ultra-dense
matter. The possible discovery of jet quenching at RHIC by STAR and PHENIX is
highlighted.

baryons from the hadronic matter formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions.
The mechanism we introduce is the strangeness-exchange reactions between
antikaons and hyperons. We find that these reactions contribute significantly
to the production of multistrange baryons in heavy ion collisions at SPS
energies, which has been found to be appreciably enhanced. We have also made
predictions for multistrange baryon production in heavy ion collisions at RHIC
and found a similar enhancement.

in relativistic heavy ion collisions is investigated. In solving the
relativistic Boltzmann equation, the characteristic range of the collision
kernel is varied from approximately one fm to zero while leaving the mean-free
path unchanged. Modifying this range is shown to significantly affect spectra
and flow observables. The finite range is shown to provide effective
viscosities, shear, bulk viscosity and heat conductivity, with the viscous
coefficients being proportional to the square of the interaction range.

transform-limited laser pulse that is short compared with the classical Kepler
period of the system interacts mainly with the wave packet state localized near
the atomic core, allowing selective control in this basis. We argue that wave
packet control in this regime is useful for multilevel quantum information
processing.

spaces and for vector spaces over the rational numbers, where the standard
Gleason theorem fails. 2) A way of rewriting the quantum collapse rule so that
it looks almost precisely identical to Bayes rule for updating probabilities in
classical probability theory. And 3) a derivation of the tensor-product rule
for combining quantum systems (and with it the very notion of quantum
entanglement) from Gleason-like considerations for local measurements on
bipartite systems along with classical communication.

relativistic quantum mechanics. At the present stage the bundle form of the
theory is equivalent to its conventional one, but it admits new types of
generalizations in different directions.
  In the present, second, part of our investigation, we consider a covariant
approach to bundle description of relativistic quantum mechanics.
  In it the wavefunctions are replaced with (state) sections of a suitably
chosen vector bundle over space-time whose (standard) fibre is the space of the
wavefunctions. Now the quantum evolution is described as a linear
transportation (by means of the transport along the identity map of the
space\nobreakdash-time) of the state sections in the (total) bundle space.
Connections between the (retarded) Green functions of the relativistic wave
equations and the evolution operators and transports are found. Especially the
Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations are considered.
