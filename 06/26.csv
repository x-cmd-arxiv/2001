s^{-1}) and variable source having a minimum observed doubling/halving time
scale of \sim 10 - 20 ksec. A simple power law with photon index of \Gamma \sim
1.75 and small absorption (N_H < 4\times 10^{20} cm^{-2}) can reproduce the NGC
7679 spectrum from 0.1 up to 50 keV. These X-ray properties are unambiguous
signs of Seyfert 1 activity in the nucleus of NGC 7679. The starburst activity,
revealed by the IR emission, optical spectroscopy and H\alpha imaging, and
dominating in the optical and IR bands, is clearly overwhelmed by the AGN in
the X-ray band. Although, at first glance, this is similar to what is observed
in other starburst-AGN galaxies (e.g. NGC 6240, NGC 4945), most strikingly here
and at odds with the above examples, the X-ray spectrum of NGC 7679 does not
appear to be highly absorbed. The main peculiarity of objects like NGC 7679 is
not the strength of their starburst but the apparent optical weakness of the
Seyfert 1 nucleus when compared with its X-ray luminosity. To date NGC 7679 is
one of the few Seyfert 1/ Starburst composites for which the broad-band X-ray
properties have been investigated in detail. The results presented here imply
that optical and infrared spectroscopy could be highly inefficient in revealing
the presence of an AGN in these kinds of objects, which instead is clearly
revealed from X-ray spectroscopic and variability investigations.

narrow-band, H(alpha) emission lines in the optical spectra of reddened,
early-type stars (e.g. HD 44179, IRAS 18179-1346, IRAS 20298+4011). It is
proposed that hydrogen atoms surrounding compact H II regions enveloping such
stars become coherently phased via a nonlinear photonic mechanism that leads to
`electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)'. EIT is a powerful technique
that can be used to make a material system transparent to resonant laser
radiation, while still allowing large nonlinear resonant processes to occur
with high probability. In EIT terminology, a `Lambda' configuration, involving
H-atom levels (1s, 3p, and 2s), is here assumed to be operative. The EIT
`coupling beam' is the narrow-band H(alpha) radiation predicted to be
coherently generated via a standard `laser without inversion (LWI)' scenario
when coherently phased atoms are excited to the 3p level by means of a separate
nonlinear excitation process known as resonant hyper-Raman scattering (HRS). In
the unit HRS pumping process, a pair of far-ultraviolet (FUV) photons, with
frequencies lying very close to Ly- beta but offset from it by equal amounts to
high and low energies, are absorbed from the star's blackbody continuum, a
photon at Ly-beta line center is emitted, and an atom is excited to the 3p
level - with all events in this energy conserving process occurring
simultaneously. The EIT `probe beam' is the light predicted to be coherently
generated at Ly-beta line center, which - as a result of the complete linear
transparency afforded at this frequency by the coherently phased H atoms - can
propagate completely unattenuated through the optically thick H-atom cloud
surrounding the star.

  implication for Fe K-alpha line reverberation studies of AGN","submitted to ApJ May 2001",,"10.1086/338333",,"astro-ph",,"  We perform a first study of time-dependent X-ray reflection in photo-ionized
accretion disks. We assume a step-functional change in the X-ray flux and use a
simplified prescription to describe the time evolution of the illuminated gas
density profile in response to changes in the flux. We find that the dynamical
time for re-adjustment of the hydrostatic balance is an important relaxation
time scale of the problem since it affects evolution of the ionization state of
the reflector. Because of this the Fe K-alpha line emissivity depends on the
shape and intensity of the illuminating flux in prior times, and hence it is
not a function of the instantaneous illuminating spectrum. Moreover, during the
transition, a prominent Helium-like component of the Fe K-alpha line may
appear. As a result, the line flux may appear to be completely uncorrelated
with X-ray continuum flux on time scales shorter than the dynamical time. In
addition, the time-dependence of the illuminating flux may leave imprints even
on the time-averaged line spectra, which may be used as an additional test of
accretion disk geometry. Our findings appear to be important for the proposed
Fe K-alpha line reverberation studies in lamppost-like geometries for accretion
rates exceeding about $\sim 1%$ of the Eddington value. However, most AGN do
not show Helium-like lines that are prominent in such models, probably
indicating that these models are not applicable to real sources.

reconnection sites just above the magnetosphere of newborn millisecond pulsars
originated by accretion induced collapse (AIC-pulsars). Although the expected
rate of AIC sources in our own Galaxy is very small, our estimates have shown
that the observed total flux of UHECRs could be obtained from the integrated
contribution from AIC-pulsars of the whole distribution of galaxies located
within a distance which is unaffected by the GZK cutoff ($\sim 50 $ Mpc). We
presently examine the potential acceleration mechanisms in the magnetic
reconnection site and find that first-order Fermi acceleration cannot provide
sufficient efficiency (due to synchrotron losses). This leaves the one-shot
acceleration via an induced electric field within the reconnection region as
the only viable process for UHECR acceleration. We formulate the constraints on
both the magnetic field topology and strength in order to accelerate the
particles and allow them to freely escape from the system. Under fast
reconnection, we find that AIC-pulsars with surface B-fields $10^{12} $ G $<
B_{\star} \lesssim $ $10^{15}$ G and spin periods 1 ms $\lesssim P_{\star} < $
60 ms, are able to accelerate particles to energies $\geq 10^{20} $ eV, but the
magnetic field just above the Alfv\'en surface must be predominantly toroidal
for the particles to be allowed to escape from the acceleration zone without
being deflected. Synchrotron losses bring potentially important constraints on
the B-field geometry of $any$ UHECR accelerators involving compact sources with
strong magnetic fields.

investigate the secular interactions of a system of mutually inclined planets

resonance. We determine the normal modes of some mutually inclined planet-disk

internally subject to the effects of gas pressure, self-gravity, and turbulent
viscosity. The behavior of the disk at a secular resonance is radically
different from that of a particle, owing mainly to the effects of gas pressure.
The resonance is typically broadened by gas pressure to the extent that global
effects, including large-scale warps, dominate. The standard resonant torque
formula is invalid in this regime. Secular interactions cause a decay of the
inclination at a rate that depends on the disk properties, including its mass,

morphology in 32 nearby galaxies and estimate the ``morphological
k-correction'' expected if these objects were observed unevolved at high
redshift. Using the common indices of central concentration (C) and rotational
asymmetry (A) to quantify morphology, we consider independently two phenomena
that give rise to this k-correction. Bandshifting, the decrease in rest-frame
wavelength of light observed through optical filters, is explored by measuring
these indices in several passbands for each galaxy, and it is found to be the
primary driver of changes in C and A. In general, the optical trend found for
decreasing C and increasing A when going to shorter wavelengths extends to the
FUV. However, the patchy nature of recent star-formation in late-type galaxies,
which is accentuated in the FUV, results in poor quantitative correspondence
between morphologies determined in the optical and FUV. We then artificially
redshift our FUV images into the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) filters to simulate
various cosmological distance effects such as surface brightness dimming and
loss of spatial resolution. Hubble types of many galaxies in our sample are not
readily identifiable at redshifts beyond z ~ 1, and the galaxies themselves are
difficult to detect beyond z ~ 3. Only features of the highest surface
brightness remain visible at cosmological distances. Our simulations suggest
that k-corrections alone are indeed capable of producing the peculiar
morphologies observed at high redshift.

idea that there was a non-gravitational energy injection in these systems, are
able to reproduce many observed correlations, in particular the L_X-T relation
and the ``central entropy floor'' in groups. Limiting models exist which
describe the behaviour of clusters and groups separately, but no analytic
modeling has yet been found to unify both mass ranges. {\it It is the aim of
this paper to provide such an analytic model.} Our description relies on a now
standard description of the shock thought to occur in these systems near the
virial radius (Cavaliere et al., 98), the isothermality and spherical symmetry
of the intracluster medium, as well as the reinterpretation of observed
quantities (like the X-ray luminosity, the gas mass M_{ICM} and the central SZ
effect y_0) in terms of the specific entropy. This allows the derivation of
analytic expressions for several observed correlations (L_X-T, M_{ICM}-T,
y_0-T,...) and their normalisation encompassing \emph{both the group and the
cluster regimes}. The analytic predictions compare very well with observations,
as well as with more elaborated semi-analytic schemes. This agreement allows a
reinterpretation of the L_X-T relation (via the quantity L_X/T^{7/2}) and the
y_0-T relation (via y_0/T^{5/2}) as indirect measures of the non-gravitational
entropy content of groups and clusters of galaxies. Finally, we emphasize the
need for shock heating, even in the group mass range : \emph{shocks can not be
completely supressed in groups} (and thus groups can not be entirely
isentropic) unless an unacceptably high entropy floor is needed in order to
break the self-similarity in the L_X-T relation.

properties of the GC systems favor a bulge rather than a disk origin. The
number of metal-rich GCs normalized by the bulge luminosity is roughly constant
(i.e. bulge S_N ~ 1) in nearby spirals, and this value is similar to that for
field ellipticals when only the red (metal--rich) GCs are considered. We argue
that the metallicity distributions of GCs in spiral and elliptical galaxies are
remarkably similar, and that they obey the same correlation of mean GC
metallicity with host galaxy mass. We further suggest that the metal-rich GCs
in spirals are the direct analogs of the red GCs seen in ellipticals. The
formation of a bulge/spheroidal stellar system is accompanied by the formation
of metal-rich GCs. The similarities between GC systems in spiral and elliptical

feedback in N-body/SPH simulations of galaxy formation. First, we compare
different prescriptions in the literature for turning cold gas into stars
neglecting feedback effects. We find that most prescriptions give broadly
similar results: the ratio of cold gas to stars in the final galaxies is
primarily controlled by the range of gas densities where star formation is
allowed to proceed efficiently. In the absence of feedback, the fraction of gas
that cools is much too high resulting, for example, in a K-band luminosity
function that is much brighter than observed. This problem is ameliorated by
including a feedback model which either imparts radial kinetic perturbations to
galactic gas or directly reheats such material and prevents it from cooling for
a certain period of time. In both these models, a significant fraction of cold
gas is heated and expelled from haloes with an efficiency that varies inversely
with with halo circular velocity. Increasing the resolution of a simulation
allows a wider dynamic range in mass to be followed, but the average properties
of the resolved galaxy population remain largely unaffected. However, as the
resolution is increased, more and more gas is reheated by small galaxies; our
results suggest that convergence requires the full mass range of galaxies to be
resolved.

which is a companion of a wind-fed mass-exchange close binary system is
discussed. During the subsonic propeller state the neutron star magnetosphere
is surrounded by a spherical quasi-static plasma envelope, which is extended
from the magnetospheric boundary up to the star accretion radius. The energy
input to the envelope due to the propeller action by the neutron star exceeds
the radiative losses and the plasma temperature in the envelope is of the order
of the free-fall temperature. Under this condition the magnetospheric boundary
is interchange stable. Nevertheless, I find that the rate of plasma penetration
from the envelope into the magnetic field of the neutron star due to diffusion
and magnetic field line reconnection processes is large enough for the
accretion power to dominate the spindown power. I show that the accretion
luminosity of the neutron star in the subsonic propeller state is 5*10**{30} -
10**{33} (dM/dt)_{15} erg/s, where dM/dt is the strength of the normal
companion stellar wind which is parametrized in terms of the maximum possible
mass accretion rate onto the neutron star magnetosphere. On this basis I
suggest that neutron stars in the subsonic propeller state are expected to be
observed as low luminous accretion-powered pulsars. The magnetospheric radius
of the neutron star in this state is determined by the strength of the stellar
wind, (dM/dt)_c, while the accretion luminosity is determined by the rate of
plasma penetration into the star magnetosphere, (dM/dt)_a, which is (dM/dt)_a
<< (dM/dt)_c. That is why the classification of the neutron star state in these

line profiles is only possible when taking density gradients and an internal
turbulent structure of the cores into account. The observational data can be
fitted by a spherically symmetric radiative transfer model including such
gradients and a turbulent clumping. We find that the observed massive cores are
approximately virialised with a clumpy density profile that decays with a
radial exponent of about -1.6 down to a relatively sharp outer boundary.
  We show that a careful analysis of spatially unresolved multi-line

The
model is based on the flaring disk model of Chiang & Goldreich (1997), but with
the central regions of the disk removed. The inner rim of the disk is puffed up
and is much hotter than the rest of the disk, because it is directly exposed to
the stellar flux. If located at the dust evaporation radius, its reemitted flux
produces a conspicuous bump in the SED which peaks at 2-3 micron. We propose
that this emission is the explanation for the near-infrared bump observed in
the SEDs of Herbig Ae stars. We study for which stellar parameters this bump
would be observable, and find that it is the case for Herbig Ae stellar
parameters but not for T-Tauri stars, confirming what is found from the
observations. We also study the effects of the shadow cast by the inner rim
over the rest of the flaring disk. The shadowed region can be quite large, and
under some circumstances the entire disk may lie in the shadow. This shadowed
region will be much cooler than an unshadowed flaring disk, since its only
heating sources are radial radiative diffusion and possible indirect sources of
irradiation. Under certain special circumstances the shadowing effect can
suppress, or even completely eliminate, the 10 micron emission feature from the
spectrum, which might explain the anomalous SEDs of some isolated Herbig Ae
stars in the sample of Meeus et al. (2001). At much larger radii the disk
emerges from the shadow, and continues as a flaring disk towards the outer
edge. The complete model, including structure of the inner edge, shadowed
region and the flared outer part, is described in detail in this paper, and we
show examples of the general behavior of the model for varying parameters.

space into a cubic grid of cells. The side length of each cell is of the order
of the bulk correlation length of the bulk liquid. Large length scale states of
the cells are specified with an Ising variable. Finer length scale effects are
described with a Gaussian field, with mean and variance affected by both the
large length scale field and by the constraints imposed by solutes. In the
absence of solutes and corresponding constraints, integration over the Gaussian
field yields an effective lattice gas Hamiltonian for the large length scale
field. In the presence of solutes, the integration adds additional terms to
this Hamiltonian. We identify these terms analytically. They can provoke large
length scale effects, such as the formation of interfaces and depletion layers.
We apply our theory to compute the reversible work to form a bubble in liquid
water, as a function of the bubble radius. Comparison with molecular simulation
results for the same function indicates that the theory is reasonably accurate.
Importantly, simulating the large length scale field involves binary arithmetic
only. It thus provides a computationally convenient scheme to incorporate
explicit solvent dynamics and structure in simulation studies of large
molecular assemblies.

type is a S/F/S junction. On the basis of the Eilenberger equation, the

h\tau\ll1$ the expression for the Josephson critical current $I_c$ is reduced
to that which can be obtained from the Usadel equation ($h$ is the exchange
energy, $\tau$ is the momentum relaxation time). In the opposite limit
$h\tau\gg1$ the superconducting condensate oscillates with period $% v_F/h$ and
penetrates into the F region over distances of the order of the mean free path
$l$. For this kind of junctions we also calculate $I_J$ in the case when the F
layer presents a nonhomogeneous (spiral) magnetic structure with the period
$2\pi /Q$. It is shown that for not too low temperatures, the $\pi$-state which
occurs in the case of a homogeneous magnetization (Q=0) may disappear even at
small values of $Q$. In this nonhomogeneous case, the superconducting
condensate has a nonzero triplet component and can penetrate into the F layer
over a long distance of the order of $\xi_{T}=% \sqrt{D/2\pi T}$. The junction
of the second type consists of two S/F bilayers separated by a thin insulating
film. It is shown that the critical Josephson current $I_{c}$ depends on the
relative orientation of the effective exchange field $h$ of the bilayers. In
the case of an antiparallel orientation, $I_{c}$ increases with increasing $h$.

follows: ``the hypothesis that the log-periodic component is present in the
data cannot be rejected at the 95% confidence level when using all the data
prior to the 1987 crash; however, it can be rejected by removing the last year
of data.'' (e.g., by removing 15% of the data closest to the critical point).
We stress that it is naive to analyze a critical point phenomenon, i.e., a
power law divergence, reliably by removing the most important part of the data
closest to the critical point. We also present the history of log-periodicity
in the present context explaining its essential features and why it may be
important. We offer an extension of the rational expectation bubble model for
general and arbitrary risk-aversion within the general stochastic discount
factor theory. We suggest guidelines for using log-periodicity and explain how
to develop and interpret statistical tests of log-periodicity. We discuss the
issue of prediction based on our results and the evidence of outliers in the
distribution of drawdowns. New statistical tests demonstrate that the 1% to 10%
quantile of the largest events of the population of drawdowns of the Nasdaq
composite index and of the Dow Jones Industrial Average index belong to a

continuous symmetry around the $\hat z$ axis, the Goldstone theorem implies
that the spectral gap above such ground states must tend to zero as $L\to

to construct excited states whose energy gap shrinks as $R^{-2}$. Here we prove
that, uniformly in the height of the cylinder and in the location of the

adapting to the latter the recursive analysis to estimate from below the

Changing the temperature changes the length scale at which the system is
observed, thereby allowing rejuvenation (that concerns short length scales) and
memory (stored in long length scales) to coexist. We show that previous
experiments can be reanalyzed in terms of {\it vanishing energy barriers} at
the spin-glass transition, an important ingredient to obtain a fast separation
of time scales. We propose to distinguish between `fixed landscape
rejuvenation', which is already present in simple two (or multi) level systems,
from the `strong' chaos effect on scales larger than an `overlap length'
conjectured in the context of the droplet model. We argue that most experiments
can be accounted for without invoking the existence of an overlap length. New

all selection rules; a program input terminates if it terminates for selection
rules which only select atoms that are sufficiently instantiated in their input
positions, so that these arguments do not get instantiated any further by the
unification; a program local delay terminates if it terminates for local

overcome these difficulties. Our approach is based on transforming a program in
way that allows integrating and extending techniques originally developed for
analysis of numerical computations in the framework of query-mapping pairs with
the well-known framework of acceptability. Such an integration not only
contributes to the understanding of termination behaviour of numerical
computations, but also allows to perform a correct analysis of such
computations automatically, thus, extending previous work on a
constraints-based approach to termination. In the last section of the paper we
discuss possible extensions of the technique, including incorporating general
term orderings.

  Lake City, July 8--11, 2001",,,"AIAA 2001-3360","gr-qc",,"  Why does {\bf F} equal m{\bf a} in Newton's equation of motion? How does a
gravitational field produce a force? Why are inertial mass and gravitational
mass the same? It appears that all three of these seemingly axiomatic
foundational questions have an answer involving an identical physical process:
interaction between the electromagnetic quantum vacuum and the fundamental
charged particles (quarks and electrons) constituting matter. All three of
these effects and equalities can be traced back to the appearance of a specific
asymmetry in the otherwise uniform and isotropic electromagnetic quantum
vacuum. This asymmetry gives rise to a non-zero Poynting vector from the
perspective of an accelerating object. We call the resulting energy-momentum
flux the {\it Rindler flux}. The key insight is that the asymmetry in an
accelerating reference frame in flat spacetime is identical to that in a
stationary reference frame (one that is not falling) in curved spacetime.
Therefore the same Rindler flux that creates inertial reaction forces also
creates weight. All of this is consistent with the conceptualizaton and
formalism of general relativity. What this view adds to physics is insight into
a specific physical process creating identical inertial and gravitational
forces from which springs the weak principle of equivalence. What this view
hints at in terms of advanced propulsion technology is the possibility that by
locally modifying either the electromagnetic quantum vacuum and/or its
interaction with matter, inertial and gravitational forces could be modified.

semiclassically using non-perturbative instanton methods, thus it may be used
as a theoretical laboratory to obtain clues for a quantum gravity theory. In
this work, we review briefly the history of pair creation of particles and
black holes in external fields. In order to present some features of the
euclidean instanton method which is used to calculate pair creation rates, we
study a simple model of a scalar field and propose an effective one-loop action
for a two-dimensional soliton pair creation problem. This action is built from
the soliton field itself and the soliton charge is no longer treated as a
topological charge but as a Noether charge. The results are also valid
straightforwardly to the problem of pair creation rate of domain walls in

transitions of both classical and quantum field theory. We examine three model
systems. 1). The phase transition of a quantum scalar field in a FRW universe
is analyzed through a first-principles approach in which the dynamics of the
two-point function is derived from the two-loop, two-particle-irreducible
closed-time-path effective action. Identifying signatures of correlated domains
in the infrared portion of the momentum-space power spectrum we find that the
domain size scales as a power-law with the expansion rate of the universe. The
observed power-law scaling is in good agreement with the predictions of the
Kibble-Zurek mechanism of defect formation and provides evidence of the
freeze-out scenario in the context of nonequilibrium quantum field theory. 2).
The formation and interaction of topological textures is analyzed in the phase
transition of a classical O(3) scalar field theory in 2+1 dimensions. We
provide quantiive arguments that by the end of the transition the length scales
of the texture distribution result from a competition between the length scale
determined at freeze-out and the ordering dynamics of a textured system. 3). We
discuss a black hole phase transition in semiclassical gravity. We review the
thermodynamics of a black hole system and determine that the phase transition
is entropically driven. We introduce a quantum atomic model of the equilibrium
black hole system and show that the phase transition is realized as the abrupt
excitation of a high energy state. We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics

by a statistical operator with infinite trace (von Neumann), to which

absolute and measurable. To answer this question, we conducted an experiment to
measure the jitter on a clock and found a combined 26 sigma three-spike signal

by the hypothesis since the laboratory's velocity fluctuates due to the Earth
revolving and rotating as the solar system moves through the Universe. When

but unknown residual interaction between qubits, and show a surprising fact,
namely that the average fidelity of quantum computation increases by decreasing
average time correlation function of the perturbing operator in sequences of
consecutive quantum gates. Our thinking is applied to the quantum Fourier
transformation where an alternative 'less regular' quantum algorithm is devised
which is qualitatively more robust against static random residual n-qubit
interaction.
