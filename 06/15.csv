of M31, and find that the most luminous X-ray sources in our fields are in
globular clusters (GCs). Of the 28 GC X-ray sources in our fields, 17 are newly
discovered. Approximately 1/3 of all the sources have L_x([0.5-7] keV) >
10^{37} ergs/s; approximately 1/10 of all the sources have L_x([0.5-7] keV)
close to or above 10^{38} erg/s. The most luminous source, in the globular
cluster Bo 375, is consistently observed to have L_x greater than 2 x 10^{38}
ergs/s.
  (1) We present data on the spectra and/or light curves of the 5 most luminous
M31 GC sources.
  (2)We explore possible explanations for the high X-ray luminosities of the
brightest sources. These include that the X-ray sources may be composites, the
radiation we receive may be beamed, metallicity effects could be at work, or
the sources may be accreting black holes. We weigh each of these possibilities
against the data. In addition, we introduce a neutron star model in which mass
transfer proceeds on the thermal time scale of the donor star. Our model can
produce luminosities of several times 10^{38} ergs/s, and leads to a set of
well-defined predictions.
  (3) We compute the X-ray luminosity function and the distribution of counts
in wavebands that span the range of energies to which Chandra is sensitive. We
find the peak X-ray luminosity is higher and that systems with L_x > 10^{37}
ergs/s constitute a larger fraction of all GC sources than in the MW.
  (4) We study the possible reasons for this difference between M31 and
Galactic GC X-ray sources and identify three promising explanations.

infrared selected sample of Seyfert 2 galaxies. We have found polarized broad
Halpha emission in one new source, NGC5995. In the sample as a whole, there is
a clear tendency for galaxies in which we have detected broad Halpha in
polarized light to have warm mid--far infrared colours (F(60um)/F(25um)<4), in
agreement with our previous results. However, a comparison of the optical,
radio and hard x-ray properties of these systems leads us to conclude that this
is a secondary consequence of the true mechanism governing our ability to see
scattered light from the broad line region. We find a strong trend for galaxies
showing such emission to lie above a critical value of the relative luminosity
of the active core to the host galaxy (as measured from the [OIII] 5007A
equivalent width) which varies as a function of the obscuring column density as
measured from hard x-ray observations. The warmth of the infrared colours is
then largely due to a combination of the luminosity of the active core, the
obscuring column and the relative importance of the host galaxy in powering the
far infrared emission, and not solely orientation as we inferred in our
previous paper. Our data may also provide an explanation as to why the most
highly polarized galaxies, which appear to have tori that are largely edge-on,
are also the most luminous and have the most easily detectable scattered broad
Halpha.

the motion of that particle near its resonance state. In this paper, we present
the method of partial averaging as an analytical approach to study the
dynamical evolution of a body near a resonance. To focus attention on the
capabilities of this technique, a restricted, circular and planar three-body
system is considered and the dynamics of its outer planet while captured in a
resonance with the inner body is studied. It is shown that the first-order
partially averaged system resembles a mathematical pendulum whose librational
motion can be viewed as a geometrical interpretation of the resonance capture
phenomenon. The driving force of this pendulum corresponds to the gravitational
attraction of the inner body and its contribution, at different resonant
states, is shown to be proportional to e^s, where s is the order of the
resonance and e is the orbital eccentricity of the outer planet. As examples of
such systems, the cases of (1:1), (1:2) and (1:3) resonances are discussed and
the results are compared with known planetary systems such as the
Sun-Jupiter-Trojan asteroids.

Rayleigh-Jeans tail ($f_\lambda=(2.96\pm0.06)\times10^{-19}

the interstellar absorption inferred from X-ray spectroscopy. The simplest
explanation for this Rayleigh-Jeans emission is that the optical-UV radiation
arises from thermal emission from the surface of the neutron star. The high
degree to which the data conform to the Rayleigh-Jeans tail significantly
limits contributions from other sources of emission. In particular, our
observations are inconsistent with the presence of an accretion disk and also
strongly constrain the amount of magnetospheric emission from this enigmatic
neutron star.

extended regions of molecular gas inside. The radial velocities of both the

this distance the SNR is 14 pc long and 6 pc wide. Apparently the bubble was
created by the stellar wind and supernova explosions of a group of stars in its
center which also triggered the formation of the progenitor star of G106.3+2.7.
The progenitor star exploded at or close to the current position of the pulsar,
which is at one end of the SNR rather than at its center. The expanding shock
wave of the supernova explosion created a comet shaped supernova remnant by
running into dense material and then breaking out into the inner part of the HI
bubble. A synchrotron nebula with a shell-like structure (the ``Boomerang'') of
length 0.8 pc was created by the pulsar wind interacting with the dense ambient
medium. The expanding shock wave created an HI shell of mass 0.4 Msun around
this nebula by ionizing the atomic hydrogen in its vicinity.

(CDM) halos form via a complex series of mergers, accretion events and violent
relaxation which precludes the formation of significant caustic features
predicted by axially symmetric collapse. The halo density profiles are combined
with observational constraints on the galactic mass distribution to constrain
the local density of cold dark matter to lie in the range 0.18 <~
rho_CDM(R_solar)/GeV cm^-3 <~ 0.30. In velocity space, coherent streams of dark
matter from tidally disrupted halos fill the halo and provide a tracer of the
merging hierarchy. The particle velocities within triaxial CDM halos cannot be
approximated by a simple Maxwellian distribution and is radially biased at the
solar position. The detailed phase space structure within the solar system will
depend on the early merger history of the progenitor halos and the importance
of major mergers over accretion dominated growth. We follow the formation of a
``Draco'' sized dSph halo of mass 10^8M_solar with several million particles
and high force accuracy. Its internal structure and substructure resembles that
of galactic or cluster mass halos: the density profile has a singular central
cusp and it contains thousands of sub-halos orbiting within its virial radius
demonstrating a self-similar nature to collisionless dark matter
sub-clustering. The singular cores of substructure halos always survive
complete tidal disruption although mass loss is continuous and rapid.
Extrapolating wildly to earth mass halos with velocity dispersion of 1 m s^-1
(roughly equal to the free streaming scale for neutralinos) we find that most
of the dark matter may remain attached to bound subhalos. (Abridged)

we have analyzed spatial clustering of objects from several different samples
of galaxies, clusters and superclusters. On small scales the distribution of
objects obeys a power law drop of density with a power index of 0.9--1.5. On a
scale of ~30 Mpc for independent samples of bright galaxies and clusters of
galaxies we have detected a pronounced break in the slope of the Gamma-function
with a power index decreasing to ~0.3. The clustering is much less pronounced
in the region from 40 to 100 Mpc, and there is reason to suppose that the
distribution of objects changes to homogeneous on scales larger than 100 Mpc.
This is indicated by the slope of the Gamma-function close to 0 for a sample of
rich clusters of galaxies up to 250 Mpc.
  The slope of the Gamma-function prior to the break, which characterizes the
degree of clustering of matter, changes essentially and in a complex manner
when passing to brighter (massive) objects. This suggests that the large-scale
structure of the visible Universe even on small scales is considerably more
complex than the fractal distribution described by one dimension (monofractal).

of 1.35 +/- 0.35x10^-15 erg/cm2/s, as well as detection of emission from CIII

These observations provide evidence for a direct link between the hot (10^7 K)
cooling flow gas and the cool (10^4 K) gas in the optical emission line fients.
Assuming simple cooling flow models, the OVI line flux in A2597 corresponds to
a mass deposition rate of ~40 Msun/yr within the central 36 kpc. Emission from
OVI 1032 was not detected in A1795, with an upper limit of 1.5x10^-15

including extinction by dust in the outer cluster, and quenching of thermal

effect is investigated in simulations with a suitable time-dependent space- and
time-periodic anisotropic forcing lacking parity invariance. The forcing
pattern moves relative to the fluid, which leads to a breaking of the Galilean
invariance as required for the AKA effect to exist. The AKA effect is found to
produce a clear large scale flow pattern when the Reynolds number, R, is small
as only a few modes are excited in linear theory. In this case the
non-vanishing components of the AKA tensor are dynamically independent of the
Reynolds number. For larger values of R, many more modes are excited and the
components of the AKA tensor are found to decrease rapidly with increasing
value of R. However, once there is a magnetic field (imposed and of sufficient
strength, or dynamo-generated and saturated) the field begins to suppress the
AKA effect, regardless of the value of R. It is argued that the AKA effect is
unlikely to be astrophysically significant unless the magnetic field is weak
and R is small.

  publication in the ApJ",,"10.1086/322767",,"astro-ph",,"  A quantitative analysis of two radio source samples having opposite extremes
of ambient gas density leads to important new conclusions about the magnetic
energy in the IGM. We conclude that giant sources in rarefied IGM environments,
which contain magnetic energies E_B ~ 10^60-61 ergs, can be viewed as important
""calorimeters"" of the minimum energy a black hole (BH) accretion disk system
injects into the IGM. In contrast to the radiation energy released by BH
accretion, most of the magnetic energy is ""trapped"" initially in a volume, up
to ~10^73 cm^3, around the host galaxy. But since these large, Mpc scale radio
lobes are still overpressured after the AGN phase, their subsequent expansion
and diffusion will magnetize a large fraction of the entire IGM. This suggests
that the energy stored in intergalactic magnetic fields will have a major, as
yet underestimated effect on the evolution of subsequently forming galaxies.
Comparison with the second sample, consisting of sources within 150 kpc of rich
cluster cores, shows that the minimum magnetic energy E_B can be a strongly
variable fraction of the inferred accretion energy E_acc, and that it depends
on the ambient IGM environment. AGNs inject significant energy as PdV work on
the thermal ICM gas, and their magnetic energy, even ignoring the contribution
from stellar and starburst outflows, is sufficient to account for that recently
found beyond the inner cores of galaxy clusters. Other loss processes in the
course of the lobe expansion are considered. We conclude that the aggregate IGM
magnetic energy derived purely from galactic black holes since the first epoch
of significant galaxy BH formation is sufficiently large that it will have an
important influence on the process of both galaxy and visible structure
formation on scales up to ~ 1Mpc.

galaxies are assembled, focusing on the relative importance of mergers and
smooth accretion in the formation of ~L_* systems. In our primary simulation,
which models a (50\hmpc)^3 comoving volume of a Lambda-dominated cold dark
matter universe, the space density of objects at our (64-particle) baryon mass
resolution threshold, M_c=5.4e10 M_sun, corresponds to that of observed
galaxies with L~L_*/4. Galaxies above this threshold gain most of their mass by
accretion rather than by mergers. At the redshift of peak mass growth, z~2,
accretion dominates over merging by about 4:1. The mean accretion rate per
galaxy declines from ~40 M_sun/yr at z=2 to ~10 M_sun/yr at z=0, while the
merging rate peaks later (z~1) and declines more slowly, so by z=0 the ratio is
about 2:1. We cannot distinguish truly smooth accretion from merging with
objects below our mass resolution threshold, but extrapolating our measured
mass spectrum of merging objects, dP/dM ~ M^a with a ~ -1, implies that
sub-resolution mergers would add relatively little mass. The global star
formation history in these simulations tracks the mass accretion rate rather
than the merger rate. At low redshift, destruction of galaxies by mergers is
approximately balanced by the growth of new systems, so the comoving space
density of resolved galaxies stays nearly constant despite significant mass
evolution at the galaxy-by-galaxy level. The predicted merger rate at z<~1
agrees with recent estimates from close pairs in the CFRS and CNOC2 redshift
surveys.

mediated by an isolated column, located near the surface, is a two-stage
process involving hopping from the surface to the column and the detachment
from the column into the bulk; each stage is controlled by its own activation
barrier. The resulting effective energy is equal to the maximum of those two
barriers. For a given external field there exists an optimum location of the
column for which the barriers for the both processes are equal and the
reduction of the effective penetration barrier is maximal. At high fields the
effective penetration field is approximately two times smaller than in
unirradiated samples. We also estimate the suppression of the effective

some classes from the (truth-table) bounded-query and boolean hierarchies. It
is well-known that if either of these hierarchies collapses at a given level,
then all higher levels of that hierarchy collapse to that same level. This is a
standard ``upward translation of equality'' that has been known for over a
decade. The issue of whether these hierarchies can translate equality {\em
downwards\/} has proven vastly more challenging. In particular, with regard to
the figure above, consider the following claim:
  $$P_{m-tt}^{\Sigma_k^p} = P_{m+1-tt}^{\Sigma_k^p} \implies
  DIFF_m(\Sigma_k^p) coDIFF_m(\Sigma_k^p) = BH(\Sigma_k^p). (*) $$
  This claim, if true, says that equality translates downwards between levels
of the bounded-query hierarchy and the boolean hierarchy levels that (before
the fact) are immediately below them.
  Until recently, it was not known whether (*) {\em ever\/} held, except for
the degenerate cases $m=0$ and $k=0$. Then Hemaspaandra, Hemaspaandra, and
Hempel \cite{hem-hem-hem:j:downward-translation} proved that (*) holds for all
$m$, for $k > 2$. Buhrman and Fortnow~\cite{buh-for:j:two-queries} then showed
that, when $k=2$, (*) holds for the case $m = 1$. In this paper, we prove that
for the case $k=2$, (*) holds for all values of $m$. Since there is an oracle
relative to which ``for $k=1$, (*) holds for all $m$'' fails
\cite{buh-for:j:two-queries}, our achievement of the $k=2$ case cannot to be
strengthened to $k=1$ by any relativizable proof technique. The new downward
translation we obtain also tightens the collapse in the polynomial hierarchy
implied by a collapse in the bounded-query hierarchy of the second level of the
polynomial hierarchy.

of construction of reference unitarity triangle using the unitarity of the CKM

values of the well known CKM elements, without involving any inputs from the
processes which might include the new physics effects. The angles of the
reference triangle are evaluated by finding \delta through the Jarlskog's
rephasing invariant parameter J. The present data and the unitarity of the CKM
matrix give \delta=50^o \pm 20^o, which translates to 130^o \pm 20^o in the
second quadrant. The corresponding range for sin2\beta is 0.21 to 0.88. This
range is broadly in agreement with the recently updated BABAR and BELLE
results. However, a value of \sin2 \leq 0.2, advocated by Silva and Wolfenstein
as a benchmark for new physics, would suggest a violation in the three
generation unitarity and would hint towards the existence of a fourth
generation. Further, the future refinements in the CKM elements will push the
lower limit on sin2\beta still higher.

The structure functions, twist four $F_L$ and $g_T$ contain non-trivial

reconstructed from the traditional (super) group symmetry, statistics and
spin-statistics relation.
  The old question of extending the Poincare group to unify external and
internal symmetries (solved by supersymmetry) is reexamined in the new
framework. The reason why we should allow supergroups in this case becomes
completely transparent. However, the true symmetries are not expressed by
groups or supergroups here but by ordinary (not super) quantum groups. We show
in this generalized framework that supersymmetry remains the most general
unification of internal and space-time symmetries provided that all particles

natural setting for the construction of super-extensions, super-spaces,

unification scale inside a shallow throat causes TeV-scale SUSY-breaking inside
the standard-model throat. Another application, inspired by nuclear-decay, is
in designing naturally long-lived particles: a cold dark matter particle
residing near the standard model brane decays to an approximate CFT-state of a
longer throat within a Hubble time. This suggests that most of the mass of the
universe today could consist of CFT-matter and may soften structure formation
at sub-galactic scales. The tunneling calculation demonstrates that the
coupling between two throats is dominated by higher dimensional modes and
consequently is much larger than a naive application of holography might
suggest.

In contrast to the work of Kumble and Hochstrasser (J. Chem. Phys. 109 (1998)
855) static disorder (fluctuations of the site energies) as well as dynamic
disorder (dissipation) is taken into account. For the description of
dissipation we use Redfield theory in exciton eigenstates without secular
approximation. This is shown to be equivalent to the Markovian limit of Capek's
theory in local states. Circular aggregates with 18 pigments are studied to
model the B850 ring of bacteriochlorophyls within LH2 complexes. It can be
demonstrated that the dissipation is important for the time-dependent
anisotropy of the fluorescence. Smaller values of static disorder are

with the help of Kohn-Sham orbital resolved dipole spectra. In femtosecond
laser pulses of 800nm wavelength ionization is found to occur multiphoton-like
rather than via excitation of a ``giant'' resonance.

science it is fundamentally inadequate as a foundation for the theory of modern
scientific computation. The real-number model is described as an alternative.
Physicists often choose continuous mathematical models for problems ranging
from the dynamical systems of classical physics to the operator equations and
path integrals of quantum mechanics.These mathematical models use the real or
complex number fields and we argue that the real-number model of computation
should be used in the study of the computational complexity of continuous
mathematical models.
  The study of continuous complexity is called information-based complexity. In
this expository article we apply information-based complexity to topics such as
breaking the curse of dimensionality, approximating the calculation of path
integrals, and solving ill-posed problems. Precise formulations of these ideas
may be found in J. F. Traub and A. G. Werschulz, ""Complexity and Information"",

solid state) is extended unconventionally to the structures possessing certain
symmetries. This proposal concerns changing the way for selection of occupied
orbitals, allowing, in turn, to release the unoccupied electronic states
located lower than the ground state Fermi level of a specific system. Such
states can be treated as 'spectral holes'. Application of this technique, in
particular, when calculating the electronic structure of the HTSC-compound
$YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-x}$ (0<x<1) results in the following. The spectral holes of high
spatial localization are found. These 'spatial spectral holes' are located,
mainly at the $P_y$-orbitals of the apex oxygens. These orbitals overlap and
form linear chains which are parallel to the known Cu(1)-O chains, disappearing
when x is closed to 1. One can suppose that the linear chains of the
overlapping hole states form a 'superconducting channel'. Some other parameters
closely related to the critical characteristics of HTSC-materials are also
calculated. The calculations show that 'the superconducting channel' is broken
when the oxygen chain atoms O(1) are removed (x>0). One could easily connect
the obtained results to the high-temperature superconductivity of Little's
linear chains, as well as Ginzburg's two-dimensional layers and even to
BCS-model.

the standard two-level system through the addition of an energy excitation
degree of freedom. Further extensions are to systems containing many fermions,
with the master equations modified to take Fermi-Dirac statistics into account,
and to potentials with a time-dependent bias that induce resonant avoided
crossing transitions. The limit $Q \to \infty$, where the interaction rate with
the bath is much greater than all free oscillation rates for the system, is
interrogated. Two behaviors are possible: freezing (quantum Zeno effect) or
synchronization (motional narrowing). We clarify the conditions that give rise
to each possibility, making an explicit connection with quantum measurement
theory. We compare the evolution of quantal coherence for the two cases as a
function of $Q$, noting that full coherence is restored as $Q \to \infty$.
Using an extended master equation, the effect of system-bath interactions on
entanglement in bipartite system states is computed. In particular, we show
that the sychronization case sees bipartite system entanglement fully preserved
in the large $Q$ limit.

considerably more complex to invert since the number of required time steps and
the slow-down of the reversed evolutions are necessarily of the order n.
Furthermore, the spins have to be addressed separately. We show for which
values of the coupling parameters the phase transition between simple and
