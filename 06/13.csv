clouds of the Broad Line Region (BLR) is about 30%, or larger. This value would
imply that in at least 30% of the QSOs our line of sight crosses one, or more,
BLR clouds and, in the latter case, the UV spectrum should show a sharp Ly-edge
in absorption. This Ly-edge in absorption is never observed. This paradox is
solved if, as suggested by various authors, the BLR is flattened and the dusty
gas in the outer parts, on the same plane, prevents the observation along the
lines of sight passing through the BLR clouds. The objects observed edge-on
(with respect to the flattened BLR) would be classified as obscured QSOs or,
within the framework of the unified model, type 2 QSOs. The covering factor of
the BLR constrains the fraction of obscured QSOs to be QSO2/QSO1 > 0.5. This
lower limit is already high with respect to the number of candidate type 2 QSOs
claimed so far. We discuss this constraint in relation to recent AGN surveys.

third mass loss episode stellar winds may play a role comparable to, or even
more important than Roche lobe overflow. In this paper, we extend the
previously existing calculations of stars of intermediate mass belonging to
close binary systems by following carefully the carbon burning phase of the
primary component. We also propose different possible outcomes for our scenario

that the resulting white dwarf component of mass $1.1 M_\odot$ more likely has

consistent with the presence of a massive starburst in the central galaxy which
warms a population of cold gas clouds producing both optical and NIR emission

with a code based on the Piecewise Parabolic Method with up to five levels of
nested Cartesian grids. The simulations are basically Newtonian, but
gravitational-wave emission and the corresponding back-reaction are taken into
account. The use of a physical nuclear equation of state allows us to follow
the thermodynamic history of the stellar medium and to compute the energy and
lepton number loss due to the emission of neutrinos. The computed models differ
concerning the neutron star masses and mass ratios, the neutron star spins, the
numerical resolution expressed by the cell size of the finest grid and the
number of grid levels, and the calculation of the temperature from the solution
of the entropy equation instead of the energy equation. Our simulations show
that the details of the gravitational-wave emission are still sensitive to the
numerical resolution, even in our highest-quality calculations. The amount of
mass which can be ejected from neutron star mergers depends strongly on the
angular momentum of the system. Our results do not support the initial
conditions of temperature and proton-to-nucleon ratio assumed in recent work

from the chromosphere were equal to 8 % of the integrated Halpha absorption
from the source as a whole. These conclusions regarding the extreme limb are
almost completely model-independent. We also present a general method for using
the photometric data to facilitate direct comparison between the atmospheric
model and the spectroscopic data. While this method has some model-dependent
features, it is fairly robust and can serve to guide the analysis of spectra
while more detailed models of the lens geometry are being developed. In
addition, we find that the color of the limb of the source (outer 5.5 % by
radius) is Delta(V-I) = 0.37 redder than the source as a whole, so that it has
the color of a M0 giant.

  We propose a merger model in which the two nuclei represent the galaxy cores
which have survived the initial encounter and are now in the final stages of
merging, similar to conclusions drawn from previous CO studies (Sakamoto,
Scoville & Yun 1999). However, we suggest that instead of being coplanar with
the main CO disk (in which the eastern nucleus is embedded), the western
nucleus lies above it and, as suggested by bridge of HI connecting the two
nuclei, will soon complete its final merger with the main disk. We suggest that
the collection of radio supernovae (RSN) detected in VLBA studies in the more
compact western nucleus represent the second burst of star formation associated
with this final merger stage and that free-free absorption due to ionised gas
in the bulge-like component can account for the observed RSN distribution.

novel complexity results and give practical algorithms for expressive DLs that
provide different forms of counting quantifiers.
  We show that, in many cases, adding local counting in the form of qualifying
number restrictions to DLs does not increase the complexity of the inference
problems, even if binary coding of numbers in the input is assumed. On the
other hand, we show that adding different forms of global counting restrictions
to a logic may increase the complexity of the inference problems dramatically.
  We provide exact complexity results and a practical, tableau based algorithm
for the DL SHIQ, which forms the basis of the highly optimized DL system iFaCT.
  Finally, we describe a tableau algorithm for the clique guarded fragment
(CGF), which we hope will serve as the basis for an efficient implementation of
a CGF reasoner.

"math/0106100","Fred M. Katz","Fred M. Katz","Sets and Their Sizes",,,,,"math.LO",,"  This thesis presents an alternative to Cantor's theory of cardinality,
insofar as that is understood as a theory of set size.
  The alternative is based on a general theory, ClassSize. ClassSize contains
all sentences in the first order language with ""subset"" and ""smaller-than""
predicates which are true in all finite power sets.
  ClassSize is decidable but not finitely axiomatizable.
  Every infinite completion of ClassSize has a model over the power set of the
natural numbers which satisfies an additional axiom, OUTPACING: If initial
segments of A eventually become smaller than the corresponding initial segments
of B, then A is smaller than B.
  Models which satisfy OUTPACING seem to accord with common intuitions about
set size. In particular, they agree with the ordering suggested by the notion
of ""asymptotic density"".

relationship, frame-theoretical analogues of various quantum-mechanical
concepts and results are developed.
  The analogue of a least-squares quantum measurement is a tight frame that is
closest in a least-squares sense to a given set of vectors. The least-squares
tight frame is found for both the case in which the scaling of the frame is
specified (constrained least-squares frame (CLSF)) and the case in which the
scaling is free (unconstrained least-squares frame (ULSF)). The well-known
canonical frame is shown to be proportional to the ULSF and to coincide with
the CLSF with a certain scaling.

distributive law of disjunction and interference--are exemplified in an
emphatically non-quantal system: a deck of playing cards. Thus the appearance,
in quantum mechanics, of incompatibility and these associated phenomena
requires neither explanation nor interpretation.

"quant-ph/0106073","Andrei Khrennikov","Andrei Khrennikov","`Quantum probabilities' as context depending probabilities",,,,,"quant-ph",,"  We study transformations of conventional (`classical') probabilities induced
by context transitions. It is demonstrated that the transition from one complex
of conditions to another induces a perturbation of the classical rule for the
addition of probabilistic alternatives. We classify such perturbations. It is
shown that there are two classes of perturbations: (a) trigonometric
interference; (b) hyperbolic interference. In particular, the well known
`quantum interference of probabilistic alternatives' can be obtained in
classical (but contextual) probabilistic framework. Therefore we need not apply
to wave arguments (or consider superposition principle) to get Quantum
Statistics. In particular, interference could be a feature of experiments with
purely corpuscular objects.

arbitrary medium is presented. The quantum equation of motion for charged
particle in the field of plane electromagnetic wave and uniform magnetic field
in a medium is solved in the eikonal approximation. The probabilities of
induced multiphoton transitions between Landau levels in strong laser field is
calculated.

an external magnetic field. The energetic difference of two vacua leads to the
vacuum decaying and the vacuum-energy releasing. In the context of quantum
field theories, we discuss why and how the vacuum energy can be released by
spontaneous photon emissions and/or paramagnetically screening the external
magnetic field. In addition, we quantitatively compute the vacuum energy
released, the paramagnetic screening effect and the rate and spectrum of
spontaneous photon emissions. The possibilities of experimentally detecting
such an effect of vacuum-energy releasing and this effect accounting for the
anormalous X-ray pulsar are discussed.
