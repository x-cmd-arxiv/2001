210 fields observed in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS), covering an
effective area of 325 square degrees (about 20% of the final 2dFGRS area). This
yields a set of optical spectra of 912 candidate NVSS counterparts, of which we
identify 757 as genuine radio IDs - the largest and most homogeneous set of
radio-source spectra ever obtained. The 2dFGRS radio sources span the redshift
range z=0.005 to 0.438, and are a mixture of active galaxies (60%) and
star-forming galaxies (40%). About 25% of the 2dFGRS radio sources are
spatially resolved by NVSS, and the sample includes three giant radio galaxies
with projected linear size greater than 1 Mpc. The high quality of the 2dF
spectra means we can usually distinguish unambiguously between AGN and
star-forming galaxies. We have made a new determination of the local radio
luminosity function at 1.4 GHz for both active and star-forming galaxies, and
derive a local star-formation density of 0.022+/-0.004 solar masses per year
per cubic Mpc. (Ho=50 km/s/Mpc).

different slope at smaller radii. The mass function of dark halos is assumed to
be given by the Press-Schechter function. We find that magnification bias for
the NFW profile is order of magnitude larger than that for SIS. We estimate the
sensitivity of the lensing probability of distant sources to the inner profile
of lenses and to the cosmological parameters. It turns out that the lensing

the cosmological constant. We compare the predictions with the largest

the existence of an (initially) highly-relativistic population of electrons. We
also show that while at early epochs the dominant absorption mechanism is
external absorption by thermal electrons, at late epochs and long wavelengths
the dominant absorption mechanism is synchrotron self-absorption. Consequently,
the spectral turnover takes place at much shorter wavelengths than expected in

them as promising next generation computing platforms. They enable the creation
of Virtual Enterprises (VE) for sharing resources distributed across the world.
However, resource management, application development and usage models in these
environments is a complex undertaking. This is due to the geographic
distribution of resources that are owned by different organizations. The
resource owners of each of these resources have different usage or access
policies and cost models, and varying loads and availability. In order to
address complex resource management issues, we have proposed a computational
economy framework for resource allocation and for regulating supply and demand
in Grid computing environments. The framework provides mechanisms for
optimizing resource provider and consumer objective functions through trading
and brokering services. In a real world market, there exist various economic
models for setting the price for goods based on supply-and-demand and their
value to the user. They include commodity market, posted price, tenders and
auctions. In this paper, we discuss the use of these models for interaction
between Grid components in deciding resource value and the necessary
infrastructure to realize them. In addition to normal services offered by Grid
computing systems, we need an infrastructure to support interaction protocols,
allocation mechanisms, currency, secure banking, and enforcement services.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the usage of some of these economic models in
resource brokering through Nimrod/G deadline and cost-based scheduling for two
different optimization strategies on the World Wide Grid (WWG) testbed.
