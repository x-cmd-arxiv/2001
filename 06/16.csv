CDM halos seldom take them near the disk, where their tidal effects are
greatest. Unless the effects of substructure are very different at earlier

Additionally, we resolve for the first time 6 known spectroscopic or
astrometric binaries, for a total of 27 newly resolved companions. A fair
fraction of the new binaries has favourable parameters for accurate mass
determinations. The newly resolved companion of Gl120.1C had an apparent
spectroscopic minimum mass in the brown-dwarf range (Duquennoy & Mayor 1991)
and it contributed to the statistical evidence that a few percent of solar type
stars might have close-in brown-dwarf companions. We find that Gl~120.1C
actually is an unrecognised double-lined spectroscopic pair. Its
radial-velocity amplitude had therefore been strongly underestimated by
Duquennoy & Mayor, and it does not truly belong to their sample of single-lined
systems with minimum spectroscopic mass below the substellar limit. We also
present the first direct detection of Gl~494B, an astrometric brown-dwarf

ascertain its mass and status from first principles.

fashion corrections to the popular dust model due to multistreaming and, more
generally, the small-scale, virialized degrees of freedom. It features a
time-dependent length scale L(t) estimated to be L/r0 ~ 0.1 (r0(t) is the
nonlinear scale, at which the density variance =1). The model provides a new
angle on the dust model and allows to overcome some of its limitations. Thus,
the scale L(t) works as a physically meaningful short-distance cutoff for the
divergences appearing in the perturbation expansion of the dust model when
there is too much initial power on small scales. The model also incorporates
the generation of vorticity by tidal forces; according to the perturbational
result, the filtered vorticity for standard CDM initial conditions should be
significant today only at scales below ~ 1 Mpc/h.

equivalent width of the iron Kalpha line from an untruncated cold disk around a
Kerr black hole using fully relativistic calculations. The flares are located
above a cold accretion disk -- either on or off the rotation axis. For on- or
off-axis flares, the upward/outward bulk motion causes a reduction of the iron
Kalpha line width. To a distant observer with a low inclination angle (\theta_o
\simlt 30deg.), larger upward/outward bulk velocities decrease the extension of
the red wing, with little change in the location of the blue `edge'. In
contrast, an observer at a large inclination angle (e.g. \theta_o=60deg.) sees
both the red wing and the blue `edge' change with the bulk velocity. The
equivalent width of the iron Kalpha line decreases rapidly with increasing bulk
velocity of flares. However, the `narrower' line profiles observed in some
objects (e.g. IC4329A and NGC4593) are difficult to produce using the
out-flowing magnetic flare model with an appropriate equivalent width unless
the X-ray emission is concentrated in an outer region with a radius of several
tens of r_g=GM/c^2 or more. An important result is that the iron Kalpha line
intensity is found to be constant even though the continuum flux varies
significantly, which is true for out-flowing magnetic flares with different
bulk velocities but similar intrinsic luminosities when located close to the
central black hole. We find that fluctuations in the bulk velocities of
out-flowing low-height flares located at the inner region (r\simlt 15r_g) can
account for a constant iron Kalpha line and significant continuum variation as
observered in MCG-6-30-15 and NGC5548. (Abridged)

most observable X-ray spectral and timing parameters (such as kHz QPO
frequency) on the one hand, and Lx on the other, while generally good in a
given source on a time scale of hours, is absent both on longer time scales and
between sources. This leads to parallel tracks in plots of such parameters vs.
Lx. Where previous explanations require at least two time-variable independent
parameters, e.g. Mdot through the disk and through a radial inflow, one is in
fact sufficient if the systemic response to time variations in this variable
has both a prompt and a time-averaged component. I explore a scenario in which
most observable spectral and timing parameters to first order depend on disk
accretion rate normalized by its own long-term average rather than on any
individual Mdot; Lx just depends on total Mdot. Thus, parameters can be
uncorrelated to Mdot, yet vary in response to Mdot variations. Numerical
simulations of the model describing the dependence of kHz QPO frequency on Lx,
which observationally is characterized by a striking pattern of parallel tracks
both in individual sources and between sources, reproduce the observations
remarkably well. A physical interpretation involving a radial inflow with a
rate that derives through a time averaging process from the disk accretion
rate, and an inner disk radius that depends on the balance between the
accretion through the disk and the total luminosity seems particularly
promising. The consequences of this idea for our understanding of states and
tracks in LMXBs are discussed, and the applicability of the idea to black-hole
candidates, where the observational situation is more complex, is briefly
addressed.

central black hole mass, and there likely exists a linear relationship
sigma^2_{rms}\propto M^{-1}_{bh}. This can be interpreted that the short
time-scale X-ray variability is caused by some global coherent variations in
the X-ray emission region which is scaled by the size of the central black
hole. Hence, the central black hole mass is the driving parameter of the
previously established relation between X-ray variability and luminosity. This
findings favor the hypothesis that the Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies and QSOs
harbor smaller black holes than the broad line objects, and can also easily
explain the observational fact that high redshift QSOs have greater variability
than local AGNs at a given luminosity. Further investigations are needed to
confirm our findings, and a large sample X-ray variability investigation can
give constraints on the physical mechanism and evolution of AGNs.

of LBGs per dark halo scales like a power-law in the halo mass: N(M) =
(M/M_1)^S for M>M_m. Here, M_m is the minimum mass halo that can host an LBG,
M_1 is a normalization parameter, associated with the mass above which haloes
host more than one observed LBG, and S determines the strength of the mass
dependence. We show how these three parameters are constrained by three
observable properties of LBGs: the number density, the large-scale bias, and
the fraction of objects in close pairs. Given these three quantities, the three
unknown model parameters may be estimated analytically, allowing a full
exploration of parameter space. As an example, we assume an LCDM cosmology and
consider the observed properties of a recent sample of spectroscopically
confirmed LBGs. We find that the favored range for our model parameters is M_m

preferred region in M_m expands by an order of magnitude and slightly shallower
slopes are acceptable if the allowed range of bias is permitted to span all
recent observational estimates. We also discuss how the observed clustering of
LBGs as a function of luminosity can be used to constrain halo occupation,
although due to current observational uncertainties we are unable to reach any
strong conclusions. Our methods and results can be used to constrain more
realistic models that aim to derive the occupation function N(M) from first
principles, and offer insight into how basic physical properties affect the
observed properties of LBGs.

with MSSM matter in the SU(5)-symmetric bulk preserves both the SU(5)

(3+1)-dimensional Friedmann, Robertson-Walker (FRW) space and a compact
hyperbolic manifold (CHM). Standard Model fields are confined to a point in the
CHM (i.e. to a brane). In such a space, the decay of massive Kaluza-Klein modes
leads to the injection of any initial bulk entropy into the observable (FRW)
universe. Both Kolmogoro-Sinai mixing due to the non-integrability of flows on
CHMs and the large statistical averaging inherent in the collapse of the
initial entropy onto the brane smooth out any initial inhomogeneities in the
distribution of matter and of 3-curvature on any slice of constant 3-position.
If, as we assume, the initial densities and curvatures in each fundamental
correlation volume are drawn from some universal underlying distributions
independent of location within the space, then these smoothing mechanisms
effectively reduce the density and curvature inhomogeneities projected onto the
FRW. This smoothing is sufficient to account for the current homogeneity and
flatness of the universe. The fundamental scale of physics can be $\gsim 1$TeV.
All relevant mass and length scales can have natural values in fundamental
units. All large dimensionless numbers, such as the entropy of the universe,
are understood as consequences of the topology of spacetime which is not
explained. No model for the origin of structure is proffered.
