metallicity of a sample of field dwarfs. We confirm recent work indicating that
the stars-with-planet sample as a whole is iron rich. However, the lowest mass
stars tend to be iron poor, with several having [Fe/H]<-0.2, demonstrating that
high metallicity is not required for the formation of short period Jupiter-mass
planets. We show that the average [Fe/H] increases with increasing stellar mass
(for masses below 1.25 solar masses) in both samples, but that the increase is
much more rapid in the stars-with-planet sample. The variation of metallicity
with stellar age also differs between the two samples. We examine possible
selection effects related to variations in the sensitivity of radial velocity
surveys with stellar mass and metallicity, and identify a color cutoff
(B-V>0.48) that contributes to but does not explain the mass-metallicity trend
in the stars-with-planets sample. We use Monte Carlo models to show that adding
an average of 6.5 Earth masses of iron to each star can explain both the
mass-metallicity and the age-metallicity relations of the stars-with-planets
sample. However, for at least one star, HD 38529, there is good evidence that
the bulk metallicity is high. We conclude that the observed metallicities and
metallicity trends are the result of the interaction of three effects;
accretion of about 6 Earth masses of iron rich material, selection effects, and
in some cases, high intrinsic metallicity.

effects. It includes two kinds of electronic orbitals, as widely believed to be
present: one, directly related to magnetism, involving localized Mn magnetic
moments, and a narrow band strongly Hund-coupled to them. Also, more extended
electronic orbitals, related to the carriers in Tl2Mn2O7, appear and hybridize
with the narrow band. The possibility of a superexchange coupling between the

approach to the problem, we study the phase diagram and electronic structure
employing simplifications, for sets of parameters including previous
suggestions for the compound. Furthermore, we are able to exhibit similarities
with results obtained in 1997 using an intermediate valence model for Tl2Mn2O7,

a (four-dimensional) cosmological Robertson-Walker (RW) spacetime is described,
in a $\sigma$-model framework, by a suitably extended higher-order logarithmic
world-sheet algebra of relevant deformations. We study in some detail the
algebra of the appropriate two-point correlators, and give a careful discussion
as to how one can approach the world-sheet renormalization group infrared fixed
point, in the neighborhood of which the logarithmic algebra is valid. It is
found that, if the initial RW spacetime does not have cosmological horizons,
then there is no problem in approaching the fixed point. However, in the
presence of horizons, there are world-sheet divergences which imply the need
for Liouville dressing in order to approach the fixed point in the correct way.
A detailed analysis on the subtle subtraction of these divergences in the
latter case is given. In both cases, at the fixed point, the recoil-induced
spacetime is nothing other than a coordinate transformation of the initial
spacetime into the rest frame of the recoiling D-particle. However, in the
horizon case, if one identifies the Liouville mode with the target time, which
expresses physically the back reaction of the recoiling D-particle onto the
spacetime structure, it is found that the induced spacetime distortion results
in the removal of the initial cosmological horizon and the eventual stopping of
the acceleration of the Universe. In this latter sense, our model may be
thought of as a conformal field theory description of a (toy) Universe
characterized by a sort of `phase transition' at the moment of impulse,
implying a time-varying speed of light.

A, vol. 54, pp. 2737-2744 (1996)","10.1103/PhysRevA.54.2737",,"quant-ph",,"  A classical electromagnetic zero-point field (ZPF) analogue of the vacuum of
quantum field theory has formed the basis for theoretical investigations in the
discipline known as random or stochastic electrodynamics (SED) wherein quantum
measurements are imitated by the introduction of a stochastic classical
background EM field. Random EM fluctuations are assumed to provide
perturbations which can mimic some quantum phenomena while retaining a purely
classical basis, e.g. the Casimir force, the Van-der-Waals force, the Lamb
shift, spontaneous emission, the RMS radius of the harmonic oscillator, and the
radius of the Bohr atom. This classical ZPF is represented as a homogeneous,
isotropic ensemble of plane waves with fixed amplitudes and random phases.
Averaging over the random phases is assumed to be equivalent to taking the
ground-state expectation values of the corresponding quantum operator. We
demonstrate that this is not precisely correct by examining the statistics of
the classical ZPF in contrast to that of the EM quantum vacuum. We derive the
distribution for the individual mode amplitudes in the ground-state as
predicted by quantum field theory (QFT) and then carry out the same calculation
for the classical ZPF analogue, showing that the distributions are only in
approximate agreement, diverging as the density of k states decreases. We
introduce an alternative classical ZPF with a different stochastic character,
and demonstrate that it can exactly reproduce the statistics of the EM vacuum
of QED. Incorporated into SED, this new field is shown to give the correct (QM)
distribution for the amplitude of the ground-state of a harmonic oscillator,
suggesting the possibility of developing further successful correspondences
between SED and QED.
