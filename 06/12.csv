Accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20010863",,"astro-ph",,"  (Abridged) We carried out a period analysis on ~3700 RR Lyrae stars spread
over ~50 square degrees towards the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr). The RR
Lyraes are distributed almost evenly between Sgr and the Milky Way. For Sgr
members, the average periods are 0.574 day and 0.322 day for RRab and RRc stars
respectively. This places Sgr in the long-period tail of the Oosterhoff I
group. We report the detection of 53 double-mode RR Lyrae stars (RRd) within
our sample. The magnitude of 40 of these stars is consistent with membership in
Sgr whereas 13 RRds are located within our Galaxy. We also found 13 RR Lyraes
(5 in Sgr and 8 in the Galaxy) exhibiting two closely spaced frequencies, most
probably related to non-radial pulsations. The period distribution of the RR
Lyrae variables in Sgr is compared to those of other Milky Way satellites. We
find a remarkable similarity between the RR Lyrae populations in Sgr and the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), suggesting that these galaxies have similar
horizontal branch morphologies. This may indicate that Sgr and the LMC started
their formation under similar conditions. Using various photometric indicators,
we estimate the metallicity of the RR Lyrae stars in Sgr and find <[Fe/H]>~-1.6
dex with a dispersion of ~ +/-0.5 dex around this value and a minor but
significant population at <-2.0 dex. We do not find evidence for a spatial
metallicity gradient in the RR Lyrae population of Sgr. From the spatial
distribution of RR Lyraes, we estimate the RRab content and total luminosity of
this galaxy and find MV(Sgr)~-14.7 mag, a value that would be consistent with
the empirical metallicity/luminosity relation for Dsph galaxies.

Our results demonstrate explicitly that the shift in the position angle of the

strong gravitational field. We provide maps of the polarized emission to
illustrate how the images of polarized intensity from the vicinity of the black

distribution, we assumed that it is proportional to the number distribution of
galaxies within the GZK sphere. We have found many clusters, which mean the
small-scale anisotropy, in our simulations. It has been also shown that the
observed energy spectrum is well reproduced in our models without any
fine-tuned parameter. We have used the correlation value in order to
investigate statistically the similarity between the distribution of arrival
directions of UHECRs and that of galaxies. We have found that each correlation
value for each parameter set begins to converge when the number of the detected
events becomes ${\large O}(10^3)$. Since the expected number counts by the
experiment of the next generation such as TA, HiRes, Auger, and EUSO are
thought to be the order of $10^3$, we will be able to determine the source
distribution and values of the parameters in this study in the very near
future. Compared with the AGASA data, the significant anisotropy on the arrival
directions of UHECRs are found in the analysis of first and second harmonics.
This may originate from the incompleteness of the ORS database. This problem
may be also solved if the source distribution is slightly changed. For example,
this problem may be solved if we assume that UHECRs come from some of the
galaxies such as AGNs and radio galaxies.

gravitational shock heating has been important for the hot gas inside clusters
and groups of galaxies, as indicated by their observed X-ray scaling
properties. While supernovae are the most obvious candidate heating sources, a
number of recent studies have suggested that they may be energetically
insufficient. Here we consider high-power, FRII radio galaxies and shock
heating of the intracluster medium (ICM, including the case of the
intergalactic medium prior to cluster formation) by their large-scale jets.
Based on the observed statistics of radio galaxies in clusters and their
evolution, along with the most reasonable assumptions, it is shown that they
can provide the ICM with excess specific energies of 1--2 keV per particle,
mainly during the redshift interval $z \sim 1-3$. This naturally meets the
requirements of cluster evolution models with non-gravitational feedback in
accounting for the observed deviations in the X-ray luminosity-temperature
relation. In contrast to supernovae, such large-scale jets deposit their energy
directly into the low density ICM outside galaxies, and are much less
susceptible to radiative losses. As a clear and potentially decisive test of
this scenario, we propose the observation of `prompt' high energy gamma-rays
emitted by shock-accelerated, non-thermal electrons during the epoch of ICM
heating by radio galaxies, which may be feasible with the {\it GLAST}
satellite. Implications for recent detections of excess hard X-rays from groups
are also discussed.

L>10^39 erg/s in several starburst galaxies has stimulated speculation about
their nature and origin. The strong variability seen in several sources points
to massive black holes as the central engines. If the flux is isotropic, the
luminosities range up to roughly 10^41 erg/s, implying masses of M>10^3 Msun if
the luminosity is sub-Eddington. Here we explore a model for these sources. We
suggest that in some tens of percent of globular clusters a very massive black
hole, M>50 Msun, is formed. This black hole sinks in <10^6 yr to the center of
the cluster, where in the 10^10 yr lifetime of the cluster it accretes roughly
10^3 Msun, primarily in the form of lighter black holes. Unlike less massive
black holes in binaries, which are flung from clusters by recoil before they
can merge gravitationally, a >50 Msun black hole has enough inertia that it
remains bound to the cluster. We suggest that 10^3 Msun black holes may be
common in the centers of dense globular clusters, and may therefore exist in
some tens of percent of current globulars. If the cluster later merges with its
host galaxy, accretion from young star clusters in molecular clouds by the
black hole can generate luminosity consistent with that observed. We also
consider the detectability of massive black holes in globular clusters with
gravitational wave detectors such as LISA and LIGO, and speculate on future
observations that may test our predictions.

appears in the broad-band X-ray spectrum as a Compton reflection bump. This
radiation is delayed and variability is somewhat smeared compared with the
intrinsic X-ray radiation. We compute response functions for flat and flared
accretion discs and for isotropic and anisotropic X-ray sources. A simple
approximation for the response function which is valid in the broad range of
the disc shapes and inclinations, inner and outer radii, and the plasma bulk
velocity is proposed. We also study the impact of the X-ray reprocessing on

In order to test this hypothesis, we observed the H$_2$ 1--0 S(1) and Br

where OH (1720 MHz) masers are detected in the CND and Sgr A East. We present

the Northwest of the CND and evidence that shocked molecular gas is associated
with the 70 \kms molecular cloud at the Galactic center. We argue that the
emission from the CND could arise in gas heated by the dissipation of the
random motion of clumps by collisions or the dissipation of turbulence in a
more homogeneous medium. In addition, highly red-shifted gas of up to 140 \kms\
close to the eastern edge of the Sgr A East shell is detected. These

high S/N ratio spectrum of the z_em=2.40 quasar HE 1122-1628 obtained during
Science Verification of UVES at the VLT. We compare the column densities
obtained with the new fitting procedure with those derived using standard Voigt
profile methods. The agreement is good and gives confidence in the new
description of the Lyman-alpha forest as a continuous field as derived from our
method. We show that the observed number density of lines with logN>13 and 14
is, respectively, 50 and 250 per unit redshift at z~2. We study the physical
state of the gas, neglecting peculiar velocities, assuming a relation between
the overdensity and the temperature. T=Tbar * rho^(2beta). There is an
intrinsic degeneracy between the parameters beta and Tbar. We demonstrate that,
at a fixed beta, the temperature at mean density, Tbar, can be uniquely
extracted however. While applying the method to HE 1122-1628, we conclude that
for 0.2<beta<0.3, 6000<Tbar<15000 K at z~2. We investigate the small scale
structure of strong absorption lines using the information derived from the
Lyman-beta, Lyman-gamma and Civ profiles. Introducing the Lyman-beta line in
the fit allows us to reconstruct the density field up to rho~10 instead of 5
for the Lyman-alpha line only. There may be small velocity shifts ~10km.s^{-1}
between the peaks in the Civ and Hi density profiles. Although the statistics
is small, it seems that Civ/Hi and n_HI are anti-correlated. This could be a
consequence of the high sensitivity of the Civ/Hi ratio to temperature. The
presence of associated Ovi absorption, with similar profile, confirms that the
gas is photo-ionized and at a temperature of T~10^5 K.

galaxies inside and outside one Abell radius ($\ra$) of the center of each
region, we find that two thirds of the clusters in our sample show a dearth of
neutral gas in their interiors. Possible connections between the gaseous
deficiency and the characteristics of both the underlying galaxies and their
environment are investigated in order to gain insight into the cause of HI
depletion. In the clusters in which neutral gas deficiency is pronounced, we
see clear indications that the amount of depletion is related to the morphology
of the galaxies: early-type and, probably, dwarf spirals are more easily
emptied of gas than the intermediate Sbc-Sc types. Gas contents below one
tenth, and even one hundredth, of the expected value have been measured,
implying that gas removal must be very efficient. Our 21-cm data also show that
in the HI-deficient clusters the proportion of gas-poor spirals decreases
continuously towards the outskirts of these systems, the zone of significant
deficiency reaching as far out as $2\ra$. In an independent analysis of the
Virgo cluster, we find suggestive indications that gas losses are driven by the
interaction of the disks with the inner hot intracluster gas around M87. We
also report evidence that gas-poor spirals follow more radial orbits than those
of the gas-rich objects. We conclude that ISM-IGM hydrodynamic effects appear
as the most plausible cause of HI removal.

particle in a granular fluid supports two distinct phases. The order parameter
$\phi$ is the mean square velocity of the impurity particle relative to that of
a fluid particle, and the control parameter $\xi$ is the fluid cooling rate
relative to the impurity collision rate. For $\xi<1$ there is a ``normal''
phase for which $\phi$ scales as the fluid/impurity mass ratio, just as for a
system with elastic collisions. For $\xi>1$ an ``ordered'' phase occurs in
which $\phi$ is finite even for vanishingly small mass ratio, representing an
extreme violation of energy equipartition. The phenomenon can be described in
terms of a Landau-like free energy for a second order phase transition. The
dynamics leading to the HCS is studied in detail using an asymptotic analysis
of the Enskog-Lorentz kinetic equation near each phase and the critical domain.
Critical slowing is observed with a divergent relaxation time at the critical
point. The stationary velocity distributions are determined in each case,
showing a crossover from Maxwellian in the normal phase to an exponential
quartic function of the velocity that is sharply peaked about the non-zero
$\phi$ for the ordered phase. It is shown that the diffusion coefficient in the
normal phase diverges at the critical point and remains so in the ordered
phase. This is interpreted as a transition from diffusive to ballistic dynamics
between the normal and ordered phases.

Standard Model (MSSM) imply that a light CP-even Higgs boson discovered at the
Tevatron or LHC may closely resemble the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson. In
this paper, we investigate how precision measurements of Higgs properties at a
Linear Collider (LC) can distinguish between a CP-even Higgs boson of the MSSM
and the SM Higgs boson. We review the expected theoretical behavior of the
partial widths and branching ratios for decays of the neutral MSSM Higgs bosons
with significant couplings to the W and Z bosons, including the leading
radiative corrections to the mixing angle alpha and tan beta-enhanced vertex
corrections. The general expectation is that the Higgs couplings to W+W-, ZZ, c
cbar and t tbar should quickly approach their SM values for increasing CP-odd
Higgs mass mA, while the couplings to b bbar and tau+ tau- do so more slowly.
Using the expected experimental and theoretical accuracy in determining SM
branching ratios and partial widths, we demonstrate the sensitivity of
measurements at the LC to variations in the MSSM parameters, with particular
attention to the decoupling limit. For a wide range of MSSM parameters, the LC
is sensitive to mA ~ 600 GeV almost independently of tan beta. For large values
of tan beta and some specific choices of MSSM parameters [e.g., A_t mu < 0 and
|A_t| ~ |mu| ~ O(M_S)], one of the CP-even Higgs bosons can be SM-like
independent of the value of mA. In the case of large deviations from the SM, we
present a procedure using Higgs coupling measurements to extract the
supersymmetric correction to the relation between the b quark mass and Yukawa
coupling.

Considering the high temperature effects, we see that the Affleck-Dine field is

the initial amplitude of the field and the A-terms are both determined by the
nonrenormalizable superpotential, we obtain only very a narrow allowed region
in the parameter space in order to explain the baryon number of the universe
for the case that the Q-ball formation occurs just after baryon number
production. Moreover, most of the parameter sets suited have already been
excluded by current experiments. We also find new situations in which the
Q-ball formation takes place rather late compared with baryon number creation.
This situation is more preferable, since it allows a wider parameter region for
naturally consistent scenarios, although it is still difficult to realize in
the actual cosmological scenario.

mixing with the active (left-handed) neutrinos and be light after that mixing

two pseudo-Dirac pairs, one very light active Majorana neutrino and one heavy
sterile Majorana neutrino. For any pattern of Dirac masses, there exists a
region of parameter space in which the two pseudo-Dirac pairs are nearly
degenerate in mass. This, in turn, leads to large amplitude mixing of active

infinite square well with a time periodic pulsed field is investigated. This is
a two-parameter non-KAM generalization of the kicked rotor, which can be seen
as the standard map of particles subjected to both smooth and hard potentials.
The virtue of the generalization lies in the introduction of an extra parameter
R which is the ratio of two length scales, namely the well width and the field
wavelength. If R is a non-integer the dynamics is discontinuous and non-KAM. We
have explored the role of R in controlling the localization properties of the
eigenstates. In particular the connection between classical diffusion and
localization is found to generalize reasonably well. In unbounded chaotic
systems such as these, while the nearest neighbour spacing distribution of the
eigenvalues is less sensitive to the nature of the classical dynamics, the
distribution of participation ratios of the eigenstates proves to be a
sensitive measure; in the chaotic regimes the latter being lognormal. We find
that the tails of the well converged localized states are exponentially
localized despite the discontinuous dynamics while the bulk part shows
fluctuations that tend to be closer to Random Matrix Theory predictions. Time
evolving states show considerable R dependence and tuning R to enhance
classical diffusion can lead to significantly larger quantum diffusion for the
same field strengths, an effect that is potentially observable in present day
experiments.

investigate both the phenomena of stochastic resonance (SR) and coherence
resonance (CR) in variable size patches of an excitable cell membrane. Our
focus is on the challenge how internal noise stemming from individual ion
channels does affect collective properties of the whole ensemble. We
investigate both an unperturbed situation with no applied stimuli and one in
which the membrane is stimulated externally by a periodic signal and additional
external noise. For the nondriven case, we demonstrate the existence of an
optimal size of the membrane patch for which the internal noise causes a most
regular spike activity. This phenomenon shall be termed intrinsic CR. In
presence of an applied periodic stimulus we demonstrate that the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) exhibits SR vs. decreasing patch size, or vs.
increasing internal noise strength, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate that
conventional SR vs. the external noise intensity occurs only for sufficiently
large membrane patches, when the intensity of internal noise is below its
optimal level. Thus, biological SR seemingly is rooted in the collective
properties of large ion channel ensembles rather than in the individual
stochastic dynamics of single ion channels.

  (Birkhauser, 2001)",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The multiparticle spacetime algebra (MSTA) is an extension of Dirac theory to
a multiparticle setting, which was first studied by Doran, Gull and Lasenby.
The geometric interpretation of this algebra, which it inherits from its
one-particle factors, possesses a number of physically compelling features,
including simple derivations of the Pauli exclusion principle and other
nonlocal effects in quantum physics. Of particular importance here is the fact
that all the operations needed in the quantum (statistical) mechanics of spin
1/2 particles can be carried out in the ``even subalgebra'' of the MSTA. This
enables us to ``lift'' existing results in quantum information theory regarding
entanglement, decoherence and the quantum/classical transition to space-time.
The full power of the MSTA and its geometric interpretation can then be used to
obtain new insights into these foundational issues in quantum theory. A system
of spin 1/2 particles located at fixed positions in space, and interacting with
an external magnetic field and/or with one another via their intrinsic magnetic
dipoles provides a simple paradigm for the study of these issues. This paradigm
can further be easily realized and studied in the laboratory by nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
