center-filled region of hard X-ray emission within the young, oxygen-rich
supernova remnant (SNR) G292.0+1.8. Near the peak of this diffuse emission lies
a point-like source of X-ray emission that is well described by an absorbed
power-law spectrum with photon index $1.72\pm0.09$. This source appears to be
marginally extended; its extent of 1.3$^{\prime\prime}$ (FWHM) is greater than
that of a nearby serendipitous X-ray source with FWHM = $1.1^{\prime\prime}$.
This is strong evidence for the presence within SNR G292.0+1.8 of a young
rapidly-rotating pulsar and its associated pulsar wind nebula. From the
unabsorbed, 0.2-4 keV band X-ray luminosity of the pulsar wind nebula ($L_X\sim
4\times 10^{34} \rm ergs s^{-1}$), we infer a spin-down energy loss rate of
$\dot E \sim 7\times 10^{36} \rm ergs s^{-1}$ for the still undetected pulsar.
The pulsar candidate is $0.9^\prime$ from the geometric center of the SNR which
implies a transverse velocity of $\sim$$770 (D/4.8 {\rm kpc}) (t/1600 {\rm

for the distribution of halo subclump masses with N-body simulations of the
evolution and disruption of individual clumps as they orbit through the
evolving Galaxy to derive the probability that the Earth is passing through a
subclump or stream of a given density. Our results suggest that it is likely
that the local complement of dark matter particles includes a 1-5% contribution
from a single clump. The implications for dark matter detection experiments are
significant, since the disrupted clump is composed of a `cold' flow of
high-velocity particles. We describe the distinctive features due to halo
clumps that would be seen in the energy and angular spectra of detection
experiments. The annual modulation of these features would have a different
signature and phase from that for a smooth halo and, in principle, would allow
one to discern the direction of motion of the clump relative to the Galactic

gravity causes the inner disk to stay locally flat and only the outer regions

the outer disk, the extinction is strongly localized in discrete dust lanes.
These dust features show an extinction curve with a slope close to the Galactic
mean (R = 3.5+/-0.3) from 1.6 to 3.8 kpc, with no radial trend. Using the I-K
color of the background nucleus, we derive an extinction A(I) = 3.3 through the

extinction in even the inner disk of NGC 3314A is quite patchy, since

that the dust is concentrated to star-forming regions, as has been found for

characteristic timescale for star formation is equal to the viscous timescale
in disks, the resulting stellar profile is exponential on several scale lengths
whatever the initial gas and dark matter profile. This casts new light on both
numerical and semi-analytical disk formation simulations which either (a)
commence star formation in an already exponential gaseous disk, (b) begin a
disk simulation with conditions known to lead to an exponential, i.e. the
collapse of a spherically symmetric nearly uniform sphere of gas in solid body
rotation under the assumption of specific angular momentum conservation, or (c)
in simulations performed in a hierarchical context, tune their feedback
processes to delay disk formation until the dark matter halos are slowly
evolving and without much substructure so that the gas has the chance to
collapse under conditions known to give exponentials. In such models, star
formation follows a Schmidt-like law, which for lack of a suitable timescale,
resorts to an efficiency parameter. With star formation prescribed on a viscous
timescale however, we find gas and star fractions after $\sim$ 12 Gyr that are
consistent with observations without having to invoke any ``fudge factor'' for
star formation. Our results strongly suggest that despite our gap in
understanding the exact link between star formation and viscosity, the viscous
timescale is indeed the natural timescale for star formation.

of core overshoot due to the failure of alpha parameterization can be
effectively corrected by limiting the amount of overshoot to < 15 % of the core

asymmetrical above 5 GeV in such a way that the trailing peak dominates over
the leading peak. We attempt to interpret this asymmetry within a
single-polar-cap scenario. We investigate the role of rotational effects on the
magnetic one-photon absorption rate in inducing such asymmetry. Our Monte Carlo
simulations of pulsar gamma-ray beams reveal that in the case of oblique
rotators with rotation periods of a few millisecond the rotational effects lead
to the asymmetry of the requested magnitude. However, the rotators relevant for
the bright EGRET pulsars must not have their inclination angles too large in
order to keep the two peaks at a separation of 0.4 in phase. With such a
condition imposed on the model rotators the resulting effects are rather minute
and can hardly be reconciled with the magnitude of the observed asymmetry.

construct radiative equilibrium models of such strongly magnetic cooling
neutron stars with light-element atmospheres to compute the angle- and

beaming of surface emission is predominantly non-radial. The combination of
this radiation pattern with the calculations of light bending yields pulse
amplitudes that vary non-monotonically with the neutron star compactness and
the size of the emitting region. The significant suppression of the pulse
amplitude for large emitting areas provides very strong constraints on the
mechanisms that can simultaneously produce high periodic variability and X-ray
luminosity. We apply these results to the thermally-emitting magnetar models of
anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs), which are bright slowly-rotating X-ray sources

variations ($\delta T/T\sim0.1$); or is it cold most of the time, with
temperature fluctuations that reach $\delta T/T\sim 10$ at the top of the
chromosphere? Or, equivalently: Is the chromosphere heated continually, or only
for a few seconds once every three minutes? Two types of empirical model, one
essentially time independent and always hot, the other highly time dependent
and mostly cold, come to fundamentally different conclusions. This paper
analyzes the time-dependent model of the quiet, nonmagnetic chromosphere by
Carlsson & Stein (1994: CS94) and shows that it predicts deep absorption lines,
none of which is observed; intensity fluctuations in the Lyman continuum that
are much larger than observed; and time-averaged emission that falls far short
of the observed emission. The paper concludes that the solar chromosphere,
while time dependent, is never cold and dark. The same conclusion applies for
stellar chromospheres.
  A complete, time-dependent model of the nonmagnetic chromosphere must
describe two phenomena: (1) dynamics, like that modeled by CS94 for
chromospheric bright points but corrected for the geometrical properties of
shocks propagating in an upward-expanding channel; and (2) the energetically
more important general, sustained heating of the chromosphere, as described by
current time-independent empirical models, but modified in the upper
photosphere for the formation of molecular absorption lines of CO in a
dynamical medium. This model is always hot and, except for absorption features
caused by departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium, shows chromospheric
lines only in emission.

and peculiar phenomena (both fundamental and important for potential
applications) providing at the same time a useful tool for testing new
theoretical ideas. To give just a few recent examples, it is sufficient to
mention paramagnetic Meissner effect (PME) as well as the recently introduced
thermophase and piezophase effects suggesting, respectively, a direct influence
of a thermal gradient and an applied stress on phase difference between the
adjacent grains. At the same time, an artificially prepared islands of
superconducting grains, well-described by the various models of JJAs, proved
useful in studying the charging effects in these systems, ranging from Coulomb
blockade of Cooper pair tunneling and Bloch oscillations to propagation of
quantum ballistic vortices. The present paper reviews some of the recently
suggested novel effects which should manifest themselves either in
weak-links-bearing superconductors or in artificially prepared JJAs. In Section
2 we consider the appearance of an electric-field induced magnetization (analog
of the so-called magnetoelectric effect) in a model granular superconductor.
The dual effect, that is an appearance of a magnetic field induced electric
polarization is studied in Section 3. Finally, in Section 4 we discuss a
possibility of two other interesting effects which are expected to occur in a
granular material under mechanical loading. Specifically, we predict the
existence of stress induced paramagnetic moment in zero applied magnetic field
(Josephson piezomagnetism) and study its influence on a low-field magnetization
(leading to a mechanically induced PME).

fractionally charged quasiparticles and conducting edge-states described as
chiral Luttinger liquids. In a system with a narrow constriction, tunneling of
quasi-particles between states at different edges can lead to resistance and to
shot noise. The ratio of the shot noise to the backscattered current, in the
weak scattering regime, measures the fractional charge of the quasi-particle,
which has been confirmed in several experiments. However, the non-linearity of
the resistance predicted by the chiral Luttinger liquid theory was apparently
not observed in some of these cases. As a possible explanation for these
discrepancies, we consider a model where a smooth edge profile leads to
formation of additional edge states. Coupling between the current carrying edge
mode and the additional phonon like mode can lead to {\it nonuniversal}
exponents in the current-voltage characteristic, while preserving the ratio
between shot noise and the back-scattered current, for weak backscattering. For
special values of the coupling, one may obtain a linear I-V behavior.

We derive the resulting dynamical equations, and show that their solutions

adopting a radically different definition of time, in which the unit of time is

Varying Speed of Light (VSL) theories using a standard definition of time. Some

  Society, 2000)",,,,"gr-qc",,"  A combination of analytic and numerical methods has yielded a clear
understanding of the approach to the singularity in spatially inhomogeneous
cosmologies. Strong support is found for the longstanding claim by Belinskii,
Khalatnikov, and Lifshitz that the collapse is dominated by local Kasner or
Mixmaster behavior. The Method of Consistent Potentials is used to establish
the consistency of asymptotic velocity term dominance (AVTD) (local Kasner
behavior) in that no terms in Einstein's equations will grow exponentially when
the VTD solution, obtained by neglecting all terms containing spatial
derivatives, is substituted into the full equations. When the VTD solution is
inconsistent, the exponential terms act dynamically as potentials either to
drive the system into a consistent AVTD regime or to maintain an oscillatory
approach to the singularity.

give rise to a significant scalar resonance enhancement in e+e- -> ZZ, W+W- and
in e+e- -> t t(bar). The sneutrino-Higgs mixed state couples to the incoming
light leptons through its sneutrino component and to either the top quark or
the massive gauge bosons through its Higgs component. Such a scalar resonance
in these specific production channels cannot result from trilinear Yukawa-like
R-parity violation alone, and may, therefore, stand as strong evidence for the
existence of R-parity violating bilinears in the supersymmetric scalar
potential. We use the LEP2 measurements of the WW and ZZ cross-sections to
place useful constrains on this scenario, and investigate the expectations for
the sensitivity of a future linear collider to these signals. We find that
signals of these scalar resonances, in particular in top-pair production, are
well within the reach of linear colliders in the small lepton number violation

solution for a thermally excited massless bulk field, as well as perturbative
solutions with matter on the brane and in the bulk. We then perturb around
these solutions to find solutions for a massive bulk mode in the limit where
the bulk mass (m_B) is small compared to the AdS curvature scale and T< m_B. We
find that without a stabilizing potential there are no physical solutions for a
thermal bulk fluid. We then include a stabilizing potential and calculate the
shift in the radion as well as the time dependence of the weak scale as a
function of the bulk mass. It is shown that, as opposed to a brane fluid, the
bulk fluid contribution to the bulk dynamics is controlled by the bulk mass.

the separation distance among probes in the array, we obtain filtered and
subgrid quantities at three different filter sizes. We compute several terms

scalar-variance and test for isotropic behavior, as a function of filter scale.
We find that whereas the kinetic energy dissipation tensor tends towards
isotropy at small scales, the SGS scalar-variance dissipation remains
anisotropic independent of filter scale. The eddy-diffusion model predicts
isotropic behavior, whereas the nonlinear (or tensor eddy diffusivity) model
