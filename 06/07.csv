sources in NGC2070 are colliding wind binaries and that they are not associated
with compact objects. This conclusion contradicts Wang (1995) who argued, using
ROSAT data, that two earlier discovered X-ray sources are accreting black-hole
binaries. Five of the eighteen brightest stars in R136 are not visible in our

very wide orbits. The resulting binary fraction among early type stars is then
unusually high (at least 70%).

the current, and an approximation to the electric field, in a way that is
consistent with Maxwell's and the MHD equations. Applications to several solar
flare CA models during their natural state (self-organized criticality (SOC))
show, among others, that (1) the magnetic field exhibits characteristic
large-scale organization over the entire modeled volume; (2) the magnitude of
the current seems spatially dis-organized, with no obvious tendency towards
large-scale structures or even local organization; (3) bursts occur at sites
with increased current, and after a burst the current is relaxed; (4) by
estimating the energy released in individual bursts with the use of the current
as Ohmic dissipation, it turns out that the power-law distributions of the
released energy persist. The CA models, extended with the set-up, can thus be
considered as models for energy-release through current-dissipation. The
concepts of power-law loading and anisotropic events (bursts) in CA models are
generalized to 3--D vector-field models, and their effect on the magnetic field

the gas in these dynamically complex systems which allows unsaturated maser

ultraluminous and hyperluminous infrared galaxies (L_FIR >= 10^12 L_sun) such
as those uncovered by the SCUBA submillimetre camera. The bandwidth requirement

mass white dwarfs (accretion induced collapse), core-collapse supernovae and

gravitational-wave emission mechanisms using several estimation techniques,
including two-dimensional numerical computation of quadrupole wave emission,
estimates of bar-mode strength, estimates of r-mode emission, and estimates of
waves from black hole ringing. We also review the rate at which the relevant
collapses are believed to occur, which has a major impact on their relevance as
astrophysical sources. Although the latest supernova progenitor simulations
produce cores rotating much slower than those used in the past, we find that
bar-mode and r-mode instabilities from core-collapse supernovae remain among
the leading candidate sources for LIGO-II. Accretion induced collapse (AIC) of
a white dwarf could produce gravitational-wave signals similar to those from
core-collapse. In the models that we examine, such collapses are not unstable
to bar modes; we note that models recently examined by Liu and Lindblom, which
have slightly more angular momentum, are certainly unstable to bar formation.
Because AIC events are probably 1,000 times less common than core-collapse
supernovae, the typical AIC event will be much further away, and thus the
observed waves will be much weaker. In the most optimistic circumstances, we
find it may be possible to detect gravitational waves from the collapse of 300
Msun Population III stars.

the velocity, density, and temperature structure in the winds from the stars.
The fields can produce a longitudinal dependence of the mass flux, which would
lead to cyclical variability such as that seen in optical and UV spectra of
many early-type stars. The fields can channel and spin-up the outflow, which
appears to be needed to explain the disk-like density enhancements around Ap

for the anomalously high EUV fluxes seen in B giants, and the anomalous high

attention is given to the reports at this meeting that A stars develop magnetic
Ap phenomenon only after about 30 percent of their main sequence lifetimes. A
similar delay occurs for the emission line Be stars. It is suggested that these

the equations of motion for the dark matter due to gravitational clustering.
The second consists of making physically reasonable approximations to the
behavior of baryons inside dark matter halos. The first uses large,
computationally intensive, $n$-body simulations. We argue that because the
second step is, at least at present, uncertain, it is possible to obtain
similar galaxy distributions without solving the first step exactly. We
describe an algorithm which is several orders of magnitude faster than n-body
simulations, but which is, nevertheless, rather accurate. The algorithm
combines perturbation theory with virialized halo models of the nonlinear
density and velocity fields. For two- and three-point statistics the resulting
fields are exact on large scales, and rather accurate well into the nonlinear
regime, particularly for two-point statistics in real and redshift space. We
then show how to use this algorithm to generate mock galaxy distributions from
halo occupation numbers. As a first application, we show that it provides a
good description of the clustering of galaxies in the PSCz survey. We also
discuss applications to the estimation of non-Gaussian contributions to error
bars and covariance matrix of the power spectrum, in real and redshift space,
for galaxies and dark matter. The results for the latter show good agreement
with simulations, supporting the use of our method to constrain cosmological
parameters from upcoming galaxy surveys.

errors in the distances influences the mass--radius relationship by increasing
its slope, has been made for the first time. Distances to PNe in the Galactic
Bulge, derived by this new method as well as other statistical methods from the

indicators. In order of achieving a Bulge sample that is free from outliers we
derive new criteria for Bulge membership. These criteria are much more
stringent than those used hitherto, in the sense that they also discriminate
against background objects. By splitting our Bulge sample in two, one with
optically thick (small) PNe and one with optically thin (large) PNe, we find
that our calibration is of higher accuracy than most other calibrations.
Differences between the two subsamples, we believe, are due to the
incompleteness of the Bulge sample, as well as the dominance of optical
diameters in the ``thin'' sample and radio diameters in the ``thick'' sample.

z~1.9 compared to z~1.1 for a complete sample matched in 151-MHz flux density.
By combining the emission-line dataset for the 6C* radio sources with those for

a rough proportionality between Lyalpha- and 151 MHz-luminosity which, like
similar correlations seen in samples of lower-redshift radio sources, are
indicative of a primary link between the power in the source of the
photoionising photons (most likely a hidden quasar nucleus) and the power
carried by the radio jets. We argue that radio sources modify their
environments and that the range of emission-line properties seen is determined
more by the range of source age than by the range in ambient environment. This
is in accord with the idea that all high-redshift, high-luminosity radio
sources are triggered in similar environments, presumably recently collapsed

significantly improve delineation of the K-z relation for radio galaxies at
high-redshift (z >2). Accounting for non-stellar contamination, and for
correlations between radio luminosity and stellar mass, we find little support
for previous claims that the underlying scatter in the stellar luminosity of
radio galaxies increases significantly at z >2. In a particular spatially-flat
universe with a cosmological constant, the most luminous radio sources appear
to be associated with galaxies with a luminosity distribution with a high mean
(~5 Lstar), and a low dispersion (sigma ~ 0.5 mag) which formed their stars at
epochs corresponding to z >~2.5. This result is in line with recent sub-mm
studies of high-redshift radio galaxies and the inferred ages of extremely red

circumstellar medium (CSM) which is highly structured both azimuthally, in
clumps or filaments, and radially, with two observed density enhancements
separated by about 3e17 cm. With assumptions as to pre-explosion stellar wind

approximately 30% increases in mass-loss rate; the most recent extending from

field region between the peak fields of the SMP (H$^m_{smp}$) and the onset

glass phase at lower fields but it is also sandwiched between the higher

Thus, an ordered vortex state between H$^m_{smp}$ and H$^{on}_{pe}$ can get
transformed to the (disordered) vortex liquid state on heating as well as to
the (disordered) vortex glass state on cooling, a situation analogous to the

by the Pragma-Dialectical school (p-d) (Eemeren & Grootendorst 1992). This can
be compared with Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann & Thompson 1988), an
approach that originates in discourse analysis. In p-d terms an argument is
good if it avoids committing a fallacy, whereas in RST terms an argument is
good if it is coherent. RST has been criticised (Snoeck Henkemans 1997) for
providing only a partially functional account of argument, and similar
criticisms have been raised in the Natural Language Generation (NLG)
community-particularly by Moore & Pollack (1992)- with regards to its account
of intentionality in text in general. Mann and Thompson themselves note that
although RST can be successfully applied to a wide range of texts from diverse
domains, it fails to characterise some types of text, most notably legal
contracts. There is ongoing research in the Artificial Intelligence and Law
community exploring the potential for providing electronic support to contract
negotiators, focusing on long-term, complex engineering agreements (see for
example Daskalopulu & Sergot 1997). This paper provides a brief introduction to
RST and illustrates its shortcomings with respect to contractual text. An
alternative approach for modelling argument structure is presented which not
only caters for contractual text, but also overcomes the aforementioned
limitations of RST.

than chaotic constraint propagation in the interval constraint system obtained
by decomposing the original expression into primitive constraints. The claim
was made that the improvement is due to avoiding decomposition. In this paper
we argue that the improvement is due to replacing chaotic iteration by a more
structured alternative.
  To this end we distinguish the existing notion of box consistency from
relational box consistency. We show that from a computational point of view it
is important to maintain the functional structure in constraint systems that
are associated with a system of equations. So far, it has only been considered
computationally important that constraint propagation be fair. With the
additional structure of functional constraint systems, one can define and
implement computationally effective, structured, truncated constraint
propagations. The existing algorithm for box consistency is one such. Our
results suggest that there are others worth investigating.

summarizes conveniently the states of an agreement as it evolves over time.
Such a representation enables us to determine what the status of an agreement

drafting (where parties might wish to preview how their agreement might evolve)

the brane-localized Standard Model is coupled to strong 5D gravity of
infinite-volume flat extra space. Due to the high ultraviolet scale, the
Standard Model fields generate a large graviton kinetic term on the brane. This
kinetic term ``shields'' the Standard Model from the strong bulk gravity. As a
result, an observer on the brane sees weak 4D gravity up to astronomically
large distances beyond which gravity becomes five-dimensional. Modeling quantum
gravity above its scale by the closed string spectrum we show that the
shielding phenomenon protects the Standard Model from an apparent
phenomenological catastrophe due to the exponentially large number of light
string states. The collider experiments, astrophysics, cosmology and gravity
measurements {\it independently} point to the same lower bound on the quantum
gravity scale, $10^{-3}$ eV. For this value the model has experimental
signatures both for colliders and for sub-millimeter gravity measurements.
Black holes reveal certain interesting properties in this framework.

  treatment","18 pages, 4 figures","Phys.Rev. C64 (2001) 064616","10.1103/PhysRevC.64.064616",,"nucl-th",,"  The spectral function of He-4 is extracted from a plane-wave approximation to
the (e,e'p) reaction using a fully relativistic formalism. We take advantage of
both an algebraic ``trick'' and a general relativistic formalism for quasifree
processes developed earlier to arrive at transparent, analytical expressions
for all quasifree (e,e'p) observables. An observable is identified for the
clean and model-independent extraction of the spectral function. Our simple
relativistic plane-wave calculations provide baseline predictions for the
recently measured, but not yet fully analyzed, momentum distribution of He-4 by
the A1-collaboration from Mainz. Yet in spite of its simplicity, our approach
predicts momentum distributions for He-4 that rival some of the best
nonrelativistic calculations to date. Finally, we highlight some of the
challenges and opportunities that remain, both theoretically and
experimentally, in the extraction of quasifree observables.

momentum tranfer can be written in a simple and transparent form, allowing to
directly relate the inclusive scattering cross section to the properties of the
target ground state. Although the physics assumptions underlying impulse
approximation are well defined, their implementation involves ambiguities that
may cause significant differences in the calculated responses. We show that,
while minimal use of the impulse approximation assumptions naturally leads to
write the response in terms of the target spectral function, the widely used
alternative definition in terms of the momentum distribution involves a more
extended use of the same assumtpions. The difference between the responses
resulting from the two procedures is illustrated by two examples.

for providing secret communications that cannot be decrypted by any amount of
computational effort. This is the first analysis of the secrecy of a practical
implementation of the BB84 protocol that simultaneously takes into account and
presents the {\it full} set of complete analytical expressions for effects due
to the presence of pulses containing multiple photons in the attenuated output
of the laser, the finite length of individual blocks of key material, losses
due to error correction, privacy amplification, continuous authentication,
errors in polarization detection, the efficiency of the detectors, and
attenuation processes in the transmission medium. The analysis addresses
eavesdropping attacks on individual photons rather than collective attacks in
general. Of particular importance is the first derivation of the necessary and
sufficient amount of privacy amplification compression to ensure secrecy
against the loss of key material which occurs when an eavesdropper makes
optimized individual attacks on pulses containing multiple photons. It is shown
that only a fraction of the information in the multiple photon pulses is
actually lost to the eavesdropper.

generalize the formalism of conditional master equations to the multiple

(as the state of the system and of the environment are ultimately correlated),
we consider an example of a system qubit interacting through controlled nots
(CNOTs) with environmental qubits. The state of the system is the easiest to
find out for observers who measure in a basis of the environment which is most
correlated with the pointer basis of the system. In this case the observers
agree the most. Furthermore, the more predictable the pointers are, the easier
it is to find the state of the system, and the better is the agreement between
different observers.
