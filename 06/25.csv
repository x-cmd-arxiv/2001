  (Athens) Jan. 2001.To appear in the proceedings. Based on work done in
  collaboration with M. Axenides and E. Floratos",,"10.1007/978-94-010-0622-4_16",,"astro-ph",,"  We investigate the effects of negative pressure induced by dark energy
(cosmological constant or quintessence) on the dynamics at various
astrophysical scales. Negative pressure induces a repulsive term (antigravity)
in Newton's law which dominates on large scales. Assuming a value of the
cosmological constant consistent with the recent SnIa data we determine the
critical scale $r_c$ beyond which antigravity dominates the dynamics ($r_c \sim
1Mpc $) and discuss some of the dynamical effects implied. We show that
dynamically induced mass estimates on the scale of the Local Group and beyond
are significantly modified due to negative pressure. We also briefly discuss
possible dynamical tests (eg effects on local Hubble flow) that can be applied
on relatively small scales (a few $Mpc$) to determine the density and equation
of state of dark energy.

(Arp 217, UGC 5786) are discussed. New evidence bearing on the origin of the
starburst is presented. The bulk of HI coincides with the bright optical disk
and shows differential rotation. Its velocity dispersion is, however, unusually
large for a spiral galaxy (up to 40 km/s), suggesting that the disk is highly
perturbed as already indicated by optical emission line spectroscopy. There
are, in addition, two prominent HI tails, one extending to the north-west and
the other, somewhat patchy, to the south. These HI tails, the perturbed
kinematics and the peculiar optical morphology strongly suggest a recent merger
between two gas-rich galaxies. This seems to have been a major merger in which
most of the gas in the inner parts has been preserved in neutral atomic form
and either one of the progenitor disks has survived or a new disk has formed.

containing spatial filters are much less affected by changing seeing conditions
than equivalent measurements without spatial filters. This reduces visibility
calibration uncertainties, and hence can reduce the need for frequent
observations of separate astronomical sources for calibration of visibility
measurements. We also show that spatial filters can increase the
signal-to-noise ratios of visibility measurements and that pinhole filters give
signal-to-noise ratios within 17% of values obtained with single-mode fibres
for aperture diameters up to 3r_0. Given the simplicity of the use of pinhole

proportionality of the energy density epsilon^CBR to the gauge factor a can be

the g-2 at the 1\sigma level, excludes models that lead to the largest Higgs
branching fraction into LSP's. In all cases one expects that even though the

application to such a description, the notion of global particle is defined and
studied. To this end, a systematic use of the Fourier transformation on the
Poincare group is needed. The state of a system of n free particles is
represented by a statistical operator W, which defines an operator-valued
measure on the n-th power of the dual of the Poincare group. The inverse
Fourier-Stieltjes transform of that measure is called the characteristic
function of the system; it is a function on the n-th power of the Poincare
group. The main notion is that of global characteristic function: it is the
restriction of the characteristic function to the diagonal subgroup ; it
represents the state of the system, considered as a single particle. The main
properties of characteristic functions, and particularly of global
characteristic functions, are studied. A mathematical Appendix defines two
functional spaces involved.

states can be represented as a convolution of the classical SE with the quantum
occupation number operator for non-interacting particles. The latter takes into
account the wavefunctions symmetry and depends on the unperturbed energy
spectrum only. As a result, the distribution of occupation numbers $n_s$ can be
numerically found for a very large number of interacting particles. Using the

which takes into account the nuclear correlations in the relativistic random
phase approximation. Our approach is based on a quantum hadrodynamics model
with exchange of $\sigma$, $\omega$, $\pi$, $\rho$ and $\delta$ mesons. In view
of applications to neutrino transport in the final stages of supernova
explosion and protoneutron star cooling, we study the evolution of the neutrino
mean free path as a function of density, proton-neutron asymmetry and
temperature. Special attention was paid to the issues of renormalization of the
Dirac sea, residual interactions in the tensor channel and meson mixing. It is
found that RPA corrections, with respect to the mean field approximation,
amount to only 10% to 15% at high density.

is derived by elementary means and shown to be quite useful. The inequality
applies to 'all' operators and 'all' pairs of quantum states, including mixed
states. It generalizes the rule of the orthogonality of eigenvectors for
distinct eigenvalues and is shown to imply all the Robertson generalized
uncertainty relations. It severely constrains the difference between
probabilities obtained from 'close' quantum states and the different responses
they can have to unitary transformations. Thus, it is dubbed a master
inequality. With appropriate definitions the inequality also holds throughout
general probability theory and appears not to be well known there either. That
classical inequality is obtained here in an appendix. The quantum inequality
can be obtained from the classical version but a more direct quantum approach
is employed here. A similar but weaker classical inequality has been reported
by Uffink and van Lith.

Lagrangian, which is symmetric under electromagnetic spin rotation. Its
features are: - the four-potential is unambiguously determined by the
inhomogeneous wave equation and boundary conditions at infinity. - the Lorenz
condition and minimal coupling then follow from charge conservation. -
electromagnetic spin is conserved and spin operators can be defined without
sacrificing covariance. - quantisation is fully covariant, without redefining
the metric. - all experimental predictions are the same as in the standard
theory. This result proves that electromagnetic gauge invariance is redundant
as a fundamental principle of physics.

Model (SM). It is shown here that the restoration of the full SM symmetry (as
in the Early Universe) leads to the result that the electric charge loses all
physical meaning and hence does not exist above this scale, As a direct
consequence of this we show that `time', `light' along with its velocity c and
therefore the theory of relativity, all lose any physical meaning. The
space-time structure as known to us, disappears in this phase transition. Thus
it is hypothesized that the Universe came into existence when the SM symmetry $
SU(3)_c \otimes SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y $ was spontaneously broken to $ SU(3)_c
\otimes U(1)_{em} $. This does not require any spurious extensions of the SM
and in a natural and consistent manner explains the origin of the Universe
within the framework of the SM itself. Thus the SM, in addition to all its
successes, has within itself, the capablity of giving a consistent decription
of the origin of the Universe.

arbitrary (pure or impure) Gaussian input states. Specifically, nonclassicality
of the input Gaussian fields is a necessary condition for entanglement of the
field modes with the help of the beam splitter. We conjecture that this is a
general property of the beam splitter: Nonclassicality of the inputs is a
necessary condition for entangling fields in the beam splitter.

transition: for parameter values with classically stable solutions the

values with classically instable solutions. Similarly, the spectrum of quasi

qualitatively for arbitrary linear systems exhibiting classically parametric
