detected through their Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE). We use a semi-analytic
model to study the scientific yield of combining SZE data with X-ray and
optical follow-up observations. If clusters at a given redshift z_o can be
identified with virialized, spherical halos, they populate a well-defined
""fundamental plane"" (FP) in the parameter space of the three observables:
virial temperature (T), total Sunyaev-Zeldovich flux decrement (DS), and
angular size (theta). The location and orientation of the FP, as well as its
redshift-evolution, are sensitive to both the internal evolution of clusters,
and to the underlying cosmological parameters. We show that if clusters are not
standard candles (e.g. due to feedback, or energy injection), then this can be
inferred from the FP. Likewise, we study the dependence of the FP on the
cosmological parameters h, sigma_8, and Omega_0, and quantify constraints on
these parameters. We also show that in the absence of any non-gravitational
effects, the scatter in the the (DS-T) plane is significantly smaller than in
either the (theta-T) or the (theta-DS) planes. As a result, the (DS-T) relation
can be an exceptionally sensitive probe of both cluster physics and
cosmological parameters, and a comparison of the amount of scatter in these
three scaling relations will serve as a test of the origin (cosmological vs.
stochastic) of the scatter.

to a disk of gas and dust around the central protostar. In the first stages of
disk accretion or in the case of high mass protostars, the disk mass is likely
to be sufficiently large, so that the disk self-gravity may have an impact on
the dynamics and the emission properties of the disk. In this paper we describe
the spectral energy distribution (SED) produced by a simple, non-flaring,
self-gravitating accretion disk model. Self-gravity is included in the
calculation of the rotation curve of the disk and in the energy balance
equation, as a term of effective heating related to Jeans instability. In order
to quantify in detail the requirements on the mass of the disk and on the
accretion rate posed on the models by realistic situations, we compare the SEDs
produced by these models with the observed SEDs of a small sample of
well-studied protostellar objects. We find that relatively modest disks - even
lighter than the central star - can lead to an interesting fit to the infrared
SED of the FU Orionis objects considered, while in the case of T Tauri stars
the required parameters fall outside the range suggested as acceptable by the
general theoretical and observational scenario. On the basis of the present
results, we may conclude that the contribution of a self-gravitating disk is
plausible in several cases (in particular, for FU Orionis objects) and that, in
the standard irradiation dominated disk scenario, it would help softening the
requirements encountered by Keplerian accretion models.

Molecular cloud regions without turbulent driving sources, or where turbulence
is driven on large scales, exhibit rapid and efficient star formation in a
clustered mode, whereas interstellar turbulence that carries most energy on
small scales results in isolated star formation with low efficiency. The clump
mass spectrum of shock-generated density fluctuations in pure hydrodynamic,
supersonic turbulence is not well fit by a power law, and it is too steep at
the high-mass end to be in agreement with the observational data. When gravity
is included in the turbulence models, local collapse occurs, and the spectrum
extends towards larger masses as clumps merge together, a power-law description
dN/dM ~ M^nu becomes possible with slope nu = -2. In the case of pure
gravitational contraction the clump mass spectrum is shallower with nu = -3/2.
The mass spectrum of protostellar cores in regions without turbulent support
and where turbulence is replenished on large-scales, however, is well described
by a log-normal or by multiple power laws, similar to the stellar IMF at low
and intermediate masses. In the case of small-scale turbulence, the core mass
spectrum is too flat compared to the IMF for all masses.

state for a hydrostatic isothermal self-gravitating gas cloud bounded by an
external medium at constant pressure. We have obtained analytical conditions
for its equilibrium and stability without imposing any specific shape and

stated in the form of an upper limit to the cloud mass; this is found to be
inversely proportional to the power 3/2 of a form factor \mu characterizing the

the maximum value of the form factor, \mu = 1, turns out to correspond to the
shape that is most difficult to realize. Surprisingly, the condition that
defines the onset of the Bonnor instability (or gravothermal catastrophe) can
be cast in the form of an upper limit to the density contrast within the cloud

which can lead to electrostatic stresses greater than the tensile strength of
the grains, is often the more important. Grains may regularly be destroyed at
distances as large as 100 parsecs. This dust destruction can permit us to see
the UV/optical afterglow even when the burst is embedded deep within a
highly-obscured region. Because the destruction rate depends on grain
composition and size, it may be possible to observe the amount and
wavelength-dependence of extinction change during the course of the burst and
first few minutes of the afterglow. It may also be possible to detect
interstellar absorption lines in the afterglow spectrum that would not exist

luminous than old metal-poor globulars, they become redder after 1 - 1.5 Gyr
and can then be observed as still overluminous red clusters of intermediate age
in perturbed-looking E and S0 galaxies (e.g., NGC 1316, NGC 1700, and NGC

such, these models can affect and be constrained by primordial nucleosynthesis

One then derives a parameter estimate resulting from a least squares fit, say,
and in a second step various kinds of chi^2 goodness of fit measures, to assess
whether the deviation between data and estimated surface is due to random noise
and not to systematic departures from the model. In this paper we show that
commonly-used chi^2-measures are invalid in regression models, particularly
when inhomogeneous noise is present. Instead we present a bootstrap algorithm
which is applicable in problems described by noisy versions of Fredholm
integral equations. of the first kind. We apply the suggested method to the
problem of recovering the luminosity density in the Milky Way from data of the

in the chiral-Luttinger-liquid model of quantum Hall edge states. Tunneling
fixed points are a subset of `termination' fixed points, which describe
boundary conditions on a multicomponent edge. The requirement of unitary time
evolution at the boundary gives a nontrivial consistency condition for possible
low-energy boundary conditions. The effect of interactions and random hopping
on fixed points is studied through a perturbative RG approach which generalizes
the Giamarchi-Schulz RG for disordered Luttinger liquids to broken left-right
symmetry and multiple modes. The allowed termination points of a multicomponent
edge are classified by a B-matrix with rational matrix elements. We apply our
approach to a number of examples, such as tunneling between a quantum Hall edge
and a superconductor and tunneling between two quantum Hall edges in the
presence of interactions. Interactions are shown to induce a continuous
renormalization of effective tunneling charge for the integrable case of
tunneling between two Laughlin states. The correlation functions of
electronlike operators across a junction are found from the B matrix using a
simple image-charge description, along with the induced lattice of boundary

surrounded by a medium which enhances its superconductivity near the boundary

due to the proximity of another superconductor or due to surface treatment.
Quantities like the free energy, the magnetization and the Cooper-pair density
are calculated. Phase diagrams are obtained to investigate how the critical
field and the critical temperature depend on this surface enhancement for
different values of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa. Increasing the
superconductivity near the surface leads to higher critical fields and critical
temperatures. For small cylinder diameters only giant vortex states nucleate,
while for larger cylinders multivortices can nucleate. The stability of these
multivortex states also depends on the surface enhancement. For type-I

the surface extrapolation length the superconductor can transit from the
Meissner state into superconducting states with vorticity L > 1. Such a

instability of a scalar field near the top of its effective potential at $\phi
= 0$. Naively, one might expect the field $\phi$ to fall from the top of the
effective potential and then experience a long stage of oscillations with
amplitude O(v) near the minimum of the effective potential at $\phi = v$ until
it gives its energy to particles produced during these oscillations. However,
it was recently found that the tachyonic instability rapidly converts most of
the potential energy V(0) into the energy of colliding classical waves of the
scalar field. This conversion, which was called ""tachyonic preheating,"" is so
efficient that symmetry breaking typically completes within a single
oscillation of the field distribution as it rolls towards the minimum of its
effective potential. In this paper we give a detailed description of tachyonic
preheating and show that the dynamics of this process crucially depend on the
shape of the effective potential near its maximum. In the simplest models where
$V(\phi) \sim -m^2\phi^2$ near the maximum, the process occurs solely due to
the tachyonic instability, whereas in the theories $-\lambda\phi^n$ with n > 2
one encounters a combination of the effects of tunneling, tachyonic instability
and bubble wall collisions.

have two Killing spinors and thus preserve N=2 supersymmetry. They are
expressed in terms of a quasi harmonic function H (the ``warp factor''), whose
properties we study in the case of the simplest ALE, namely the Eguchi-Hanson
manifold. The equation for H is identified as an instance of the confluent Heun
equation. We write explicit power series solutions and solve the recurrence
relation for the coefficients, discussing also the relevant asymptotic
expansions. While, as in all such N=2 solutions, supergravity breaks down near
the brane, the smoothing out of the vacuum geometry has the effect that the
warp factor is regular in a region near the cycle. We interpret the behavior of
the warp factor as describing a three-brane charge ``smeared'' over the cycle

conformal invariance is broken even when the complex type IIB 3-form field
strength is assumed to vanish. We conclude with a discussion of the basic

electron-deuteron scattering for six values of the squared momentum transfer
between 0.66 and 1.7 (GeV/c)$^{2}$. The good agreement with the data is in
contrast with the results of the existing non-relativistic approaches. In this
work we firstly make a complementary test of the LFD applying it to calculate
another important characteristic, the nucleon momentum distribution $n(q)$ of
the deuteron using six invariant functions $f_{i}$ $(i=1,...,6)$ instead of two
($S$- and $D$-waves) in the nonrelativistic case. The comparison with the
$y$-scaling data shows the decisive role of the function $f_{5}$ which at
$q\geq$ 500 MeV/c exceeds all other $f$-functions (as well as the $S$- and
$D$-waves) for the correct description of $n(q)$ of the deuteron in the
high-momentum region. Comparison with other calculations using $S$- and
$D$-waves corresponding to various nucleon-nucleon potentials is made.
Secondly, using clear indications that the high-momentum components of $n(q)$
in heavier nuclei are related to those in the deuteron, we develop an approach
within the natural orbital representation to calculate $n(q)$ in $(A,Z)$-nuclei
on the basis of the deuteron momentum distribution. As examples, $n(q)$ in
$^{4}$He, $^{12}$C and $^{56}$Fe are calculated and good agreement with the

fundamental and a practical point of view. The result we report here concerns
only the idea of applying these methods to model the evolution of quantum
systems and does not enter into the question of their fundamental or practical
status. It can be easily stated as follows: Once a quantum stochastic evolution
scheme is assumed, the incompatibility between the Markov property and the
notion of quantum jump is rapidly established.

indistinguishable bosons, extending the recent studies of entanglement or
quantum correlations for two fermion systems [J. Schliemann et al., Phys. Rev.
B {\bf 63}, 085311 (2001) and quant-ph/0012094]. We point out that the von
Neumann entropy of the reduced single particle density matrix remains to be a
good entanglement measure for two identical particles.
