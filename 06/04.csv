been tied to the distribution of light. This has led to a ``bias,'' perhaps as
large as a factor of 2, in determining a key cosmological parameter. Recent
measurements of the physical properties of clusters, cosmic microwave

allow a determination of Omega_M without ``visual bias.'' The early data lead
to a consistent picture of the matter and baryon densities, with Omega_B =
0.039 +/- 0.0075 and Omega_M = 0.33 +/- 0.035.

spectral states. Although these spectra are dominated by a soft, thermal
component which almost certainly arises from an accretion disc, there is also a
hard X-ray tail indicating that some fraction of the accretion power is instead
dissipated in hot, optically thin coronal material. During such states, best
observed in the early outburst of Soft X-ray Transients, the ratio of power
dissipated in the hot corona to that in the disc can vary from ~0 (pure disc
accretion) to ~1 (equal power in each). Here we present results of spectral
analyses of a number of sources, demonstrating the presence of complex features
in their energy spectra. Our main findings are: (1) the soft components are not
properly described by a thermal emission from accretion discs: they are
appreciably broader than can be described by disc blackbody models even
including relativistic effects, and (2) the spectral features near 5-9 keV
commonly seen in such spectra can be well described by reprocessing of hard
X-rays by optically thick, highly ionized, relativistically moving plasma.

magnetar model. Moreover, all observations can be accounted for if magnetars
have shorter observable lifetimes than do radiopulsars, in agreement with
theoretical expectations, but no systematically different ambient ISM
densities. (3) The suggestion that accretion onto the neutron star is directly
influenced by the ISM in a way that explains the difference between SGRs/AXPs
and radiopulsars, is not possible. The mass inflow rate during later stages of
supernova remnant expansion when accretion can be influenced by backpressure
from the ISM is many orders of magnitude too small. (4) Accretion-based models
are unable to account for the hyper-Eddington bursts and flares which are the
defining characteristic of SGRs. (5) Accretion disk models also predict optical

renormalizability of the solutions is manifest, independently of the specific
form of full vertices and renormalization constants. In the Landau gauge, the
equations are free of renormalization constants, and the renormalization point
dependence enters only through the renormalized coupling and the renormalized
propagator functions. The structure of the equations enables us to devise novel
truncations with solutions that are multiplicatively renormalizable and agree
with the leading order perturbative results. We show that, for infrared power
law behaved propagators, the leading infrared behavior of the gluon equation is
not solely determined by the ghost loop, as concluded in previous studies, but
that the gluon loop, the three-gluon loop, the four-gluon loop, and even
massless quarks also contribute to the infrared analysis. In our new Landau
gauge truncation, the combination of gluon and ghost loop contributions seems
to reject infrared power law solutions, but massless quark loops illustrate how
additional contributions to the gluon vacuum polarization could reinstate these
solutions. Moreover, a schematic study of the three-gluon and four-gluon loops
shows that they too need to be considered in more detail before a definite
conclusion about the existence of infrared power behaved gluon and ghost
propagators can be reached.

Submitted to PRE",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.66.017205",,"nlin.PS nlin.CD",,"  By analyzing chaotic states of the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation for system sizes L in the range 79 <= L <= 93, we show that the
Lyapunov fractal dimension D scales microextensively, increasing linearly with
L even for increments Delta{L} that are small compared to the average cell size
of 9 and to various correlation lengths. This suggests that a spatially
homogeneous chaotic system does not have to increase its size by some
characteristic amount to increase its dynamical complexity, nor is the increase
in dimension related to the increase in the number of linearly unstable modes.

are that this will not be possible due to intrinsic limitations of these kind

reservoir with a Lorentzian spectrum is studied. The reservoir is described by
a complex Gaussian-Markovian field coupled to the nondiagonal elements of the
TLS Hamiltonian. The theory can be relevant for electromagnetic interactions in
microwave high-$Q$ cavities and muon spin depolarization. Analytical results
are obtained for the strong-coupling regime, $\Omega_0\gg\nu$, where $\Omega_0$
is the rms coupling amplitude (Rabi frequency) and $\nu$ is the width of the
reservoir spectrum. In this regime, the population difference and half of the
initial coherence decay with two characteristic rates: the most part of the
decay occurs at $t\sim\Omega_0^{-1}$, the relaxation being reversible for
$t\ll(\Omega_0^2\nu)^{-1/3}$, whereas for $t\gg(\Omega_0^2\nu)^{-1/3}$ the
relaxation becomes irreversible and is practically over. The other half of the
coherence decays with the rate on the order of $\nu$, which may be slower by
orders of magnitude than the time scale of the population relaxation. The above
features are explained by the fact that at $t\ll\nu^{-1}$ the reservoir
temporal fluctuations are effectively one-dimensional (adiabatic). Moreover, we
identify the pointer basis, in which the reduction of the state vector occurs.
The pointer states are correlated with the reservoir, being dependent on the
reservoir phase.
