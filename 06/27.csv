(a) Clusters of galaxies as probes of cosmological models; (b) The physics of
cosmic baryons trapped within the potential wells of galaxy clusters; (c) The
origin of the cosmic X-ray background and the nature of the contributing

existence of a neutral component. The models with violation of Lorentz
invariance may explain this component by neutrons becoming stable above some
threshold energy E_0. The protons, in turn, may become unstable above some
energy E_1>E_0. We calculate the dependence of the threshold energies E_0 and
E_1 on the parameters of the model and find E_1/E_0\gsim 1.5. We argue that the
characteristic threshold behavior of charged and neutral components may be used
as the specific signature of models with violation of Lorentz invariance. The
existence of the neutron stability threshold E_0 can be investigated with
already existing data.

constrain the cosmic evolution in the radio luminosity function (RLF) for the
`most luminous' steep-spectrum radio sources. Although intrinsically rare, such
sources give the largest possible baseline in redshift for the complete
flux-density-limited samples currently available. Using parametric models to
describe the RLF which incorporate distributions in radio spectral shape and
linear size as well as the usual luminosity and redshift, we find that the data
are consistent with a constant comoving space density between z~2.5 and z~4.5.
We find this model is favoured over a model with similar evolutionary behaviour
to that of optically-selected quasars (i.e. a roughly Gaussian distribution in
redshift) with a probability ratio of ~25:1 and ~100:1 for spatially-flat
cosmologies with Omega_Lambda = 0 and Omega_Lambda = 0.7 respectively. Within
the uncertainties, this evolutionary behaviour may be reconciled with the
shallow decline preferred for the comoving space density of flat-spectrum
sources by Dunlop & Peacock (1990) and Jarvis & Rawlings (2000), in line with
the expectations of Unified Schemes.

narrow (2.5-5 degree) segments, covering 690 square degrees. For the full,
flux-limited sample, the redshift-space correlation length is approximately 8
Mpc/h. The two-dimensional correlation function \xi(r_p,\pi) shows clear
signatures of both the small-scale, ``fingers-of-God'' distortion caused by
velocity dispersions in collapsed objects and the large-scale compression
caused by coherent flows, though the latter cannot be measured with high
precision in the present sample. The inferred real-space correlation function
is well described by a power law, \xi(r)=(r/6.1+/-0.2 Mpc/h)^{-1.75+/-0.03},
for 0.1 Mpc/h < r < 16 Mpc/h. The galaxy pairwise velocity dispersion is
\sigma_{12} ~ 600+/-100 km/s for projected separations 0.15 Mpc/h < r_p < 5
Mpc/h. When we divide the sample by color, the red galaxies exhibit a stronger
and steeper real-space correlation function and a higher pairwise velocity
dispersion than do the blue galaxies. The relative behavior of subsamples
defined by high/low profile concentration or high/low surface brightness is
qualitatively similar to that of the red/blue subsamples. Our most striking
result is a clear measurement of scale-independent luminosity bias at r < 10

much lower flux than typical galactic halo WIMPs, have a number of features
which might aid in their ultimate detectability: a high and essentially unique
velocity ($\sim 600$ km/s in the galactic rest frame) due to their acceleration
in entering the Milky Way, and most likely one or two unique flight directions
at the Earth. This high velocity may be experimentally advantageous in direct
detection experiments, since it gives a recoil signal at relatively high energy
where background is generally much reduced. For a density of extragalactic
WIMPs comparable to the critical density of the universe the count rate
expected is very roughly the same as that of fast galactic WIMPs. If there is
an increased density relative to critical associated with the Local Group of
galaxies, say 10-30 times the critical density, there is a corresponding
increase in rate and the extragalactic WIMPs would show up as a high energy
shoulder in the recoil energy distribution. Evidence of such WIMPs as a
separate population with these distinct properties would offer interesting
information on the formation and prehistory of the galaxy.

large quantities of data. Starting from the earliest sky atlases through the
first major photographic sky surveys of the 20th century, this tradition is
continuing today, and at an ever increasing rate.
  Like many other fields, astronomy has become a very data-rich science, driven
by the advances in telescope, detector, and computer technology. Numerous large
digital sky surveys and archives already exist, with information content
measured in multiple Terabytes, and even larger, multi-Petabyte data sets are
on the horizon. Systematic observations of the sky, over a range of
wavelengths, are becoming the primary source of astronomical data. Numerical
simulations are also producing comparable volumes of information. Data mining
promises to both make the scientific utilization of these data sets more
effective and more complete, and to open completely new avenues of astronomical
research.
  Technological problems range from the issues of database design and
federation, to data mining and advanced visualization, leading to a new toolkit
for astronomical research. This is similar to challenges encountered in other
data-intensive fields today.
  These advances are now being organized through a concept of the Virtual
Observatories, federations of data archives and services representing a new
information infrastructure for astronomy of the 21st century. In this article,
we provide an overview of some of the major datasets in astronomy, discuss
different techniques used for archiving data, and conclude with a discussion of

Weak emission in the H-alpha line was detected in its spectrum for the first

ranging from less than 0.08 to 3.3 arcsec (15-600 AU). After correcting for
detection biases, we derive a binary frequency (BF) in the logP (days) range
from 4.4 to 6.9 of 25.3 +/- 5.4%, which is similar to that of field G-type
dwarfs (23.8%, Duquennoy & Mayor 1991). This result, complemented by similar
ones obtained for the 2 Myr old star forming cluster IC 348 (Paper II) and the
120 Myr old Pleiades open cluster (Paper I), indicates that the fraction of
long-period binaries does not significantly evolve over the lifetime of
galactic open clusters. We compare the distribution of cluster binaries to the
binary populations of star forming regions, most notably Orion and Taurus, to
critically review current ideas regarding the binary formation process. We
conclude that it is still unclear whether the lower binary fraction observed in
young clusters compared to T associations is purely the result of the early
dynamical disruption of primordial binaries in dense clusters or whether it
reflects intrinsically different modes of star formation in clusters and
associations. We also note that if Taurus binaries result from the dynamical
decay of small-N protostellar aggregates, one would predict the existence of a
yet to be found dispersed population of mostly single substellar objects in the
Taurus cloud.

Slightly higher values (D/H=4 10$^{-5}$) are found in Lyman limit systems. Such
values are still compatible with CMB estimates but, if taken at face value,
they suggest a trend of decreasing D abundance with metallicity. We argue that
special assumptions, like differential enrichment, are required to explain the
data in that case. A clear test of such a differential enrichment would be an
excess of products of low mass stars like C and/or N in those systems, but
currently available data of N/Si in DLAs do not favour such a ``non-standard''

The 2dFGRS uses the 2dF multi-fibre spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian
Telescope, which is capable of observing 400 objects simultaneously over a
2-degree diameter field. The source catalogue for the survey is a revised and
extended version of the APM galaxy catalogue, and the targets are galaxies with
extinction-corrected magnitudes brighter than b_J=19.45. The main survey
regions are two declination strips, one in the southern Galactic hemisphere
spanning 80deg x 15deg around the SGP, and the other in the northern Galactic
hemisphere spanning 75deg x 10deg along the celestial equator; in addition,
there are 99 fields spread over the southern Galactic cap. The survey covers
2000 sq.deg and has a median depth of z=0.11. Adaptive tiling is used to give a
highly uniform sampling rate of 93% over the whole survey region. Redshifts are
measured from spectra covering 3600A-8000A at a two-pixel resolution of 9.0A
and a median S/N of 13 per pixel. All redshift identifications are visually
checked and assigned a quality parameter Q in the range 1-5; Q>=3 redshifts are
98.4% reliable and have an rms uncertainty of 85 km/s. The overall redshift
completeness for Q>=3 redshifts is 91.8%, but this varies with magnitude from
99% for the brightest galaxies to 90% for objects at the survey limit. The

turbulence fields is considered in order to explain the lithium decay law
during the spin-down process of solar-type stars. Rotation proves to be highly
effective in the transfer of chemicals through the solar tachocline (beneath
the convection zone) which is assumed to contain only turbulence with
horizontal motions. The effect is so strong that the tachocline turbulence must
not exceed a limit of ~10^-(3...4) of the rms velocity in the convection zone
in order to let the lithium survive after Gigayears. Such long depletion times
can also be explained by a very small rotational influence upon the
eddy-diffusion tensor if it is realized with correlation times shorter than 15
min. It is argued that such slow and/or short-living turbulence beneath the
convection zone could hardly drive the solar dynamo. In our theory the
diffusion remains small for rapid rotation due to the rotational quenching of
the turbulence. In young stellar clusters like Pleiades, there should be a
(positive) correlation between rotation rate and lithium abundance, where the
fastest stars should have maximal lithium. First inspections of the data seem
to confirm this finding.

response of a vortex core to an {\em a.c.} electromagnetic field for vortices
that are pinned to a metallic defect. We concentrate on the case where the
vortex motion is nonstationary and can be treated by linear response theory.
The response of the order parameter, impurity self energy, induced fields and
currents are obtained by a self-consistent calculation of the distribution
functions and the excitation spectrum. We then obtain the dynamical
conductivity, spatially resolved in the region of the core, for external
frequencies in the range, $0.1\Delta < \hbar\omega \lsim 3\Delta$. We also
calculate the dynamically induced charge distribution in the vicinity of the
core. This charge density is related to the nonequilibrium response of the
bound states and collective mode, and dominates the electromagnetic response of
the vortex core.

the failure in proving the interchangeability of density profiles and external
potentials as independent variables. Here we prove that, if in the CE the
correlation functions are stripped off of their asymptotic behaviour (which is
not in the form of a properly irreducible $n$-body function), the HKSM theorem
can be extended to the CE. In proving that, we generate a new {\it hierarchy}
of $N$-modified distribution and correlation functions which have the same
formal structure that the more conventional ones have (but with the proper
irreducible $n$-body behaviour) and show that, if they are employed, either a

toolkit for constructing knowledge-based systems which can be used
cooperatively over computer networks and also embedded into larger software
systems in different ways. Presented architecture is based on frame knowledge
representation and production rules, which also allows to interface high-level
programming languages and relational databases by exposing corresponding
classes or database tables as frames. Frames located on the remote computers
can also be transparently accessed and used in inference, and the dynamic
knowledge for specific frames can also be transferred over the network. The
issues of implementation of such a system are addressed, which use Java
programming language, CORBA and XML for external knowledge representation.
Finally, some applications of the toolkit are considered, including e-business
approach to knowledge sharing, intelligent web behaviours, etc.

order symmetric system of time dependent partial differential equations.
However, for numerical reasons, it might be advantageous to use a second order
formulation like one obtained from the ADM equations. Unfortunately, the type
of the ADM equations is not well understood and therefore we shall discuss, in
the next section, the concept of wellposedness. We have to distinguish between
weakly and strongly hyperbolic systems. Strongly hyperbolic systems are well
behaved even if we add lower order terms. In contrast; for every weakly
hyperbolic system we can find lower order terms which make the problem totally
illposed. Thus, for weakly hyperbolic systems, there is only a restricted class
of lower order perturbations which do not destroy the wellposedness. To
identify that class can be very difficult, especially for nonlinear
perturbations. In Section 3 we will show that the ADM equations, linearized
around flat with constant lapse function and shift vector, are only weakly
hyperbolic. However, we can use the trace of the metric as a lapse function to
make the equations into a strongly second order hyperbolic system. Using simple
models we shall, in section 4, demonstrate that approximations of second order
equations have better accuracy properties than the corresponding approximations
of first order equations. Also, we avoid spurious waves which travel against
the characteristic direction. In the last section we discuss some difficulties
connected with the preservation of constraints.

relevant difference with respect to supercooled inflationary scenarios which
require a very rapid expansion of the scale factor to give the decoherence of

fields, recently developed, is compared with the standard method of PN
expansion, in the particular case of a massive test particle moving along a
geodesic line of a weak Schwarzschild field. First, the expression of the
active mass in Schwarzschild's solution is given for a barotropic perfect
fluid, both for general relativity (GR) and for an alternative, scalar theory.
The principle of the asymptotic method is then recalled and the PN expansion of
the active mass is derived. The PN correction to the active mass is made of the
Newtonian elastic energy, augmented, for the scalar theory, by a term due to
the self-reinforcement of the gravitational field. Third, two equations, both
correct to first order, are derived for the geodesic motion of a mass particle:
a ""standard"" one and an ""asymptotic"" one. Finally, the difference between the
solutions of these two equations is numerically investigated in the case of
Mercury. The asymptotic solution deviates from the standard one like the square
of the time elapsed since the initial time. This is due to a practical
shortcoming of the asymptotic method, which is shown to disappear if one
reinitializes the asymptotic problem often enough. Thus, both methods are
equivalent in the case investigated. In a general case, the asymptotic method
seems more natural.

located in one of the interaction-straight regions of PEP-II. The small ring is
brought into collision with the low-energy (3.1 GeV) e+ beam (LER). The
center-of-mass energies from this collision are between the Phi and J/Psi
resonances. We achieve a head-on collision through the use of a central
magnetic dipole field that generates a large horizontal bending field. This
field is also the central field of the detector. The large energy range of the
VLER, in order to maximize the center-of-mass energy range, complicates the
collision point geometry. In order to maintain the beam orbits near the
collision point two techniques are used. The first is to scale the central
dipole field up and down with the energy of the VLER and the second is to use
passive shielding to decrease the integral B.dl of the dipole field seen by the
VLER. Changes in the orbit of the LER are corrected with local bending magnets.
Further details of the interaction region geometry as well as design issues
that include synchrotron radiation from the high-current positron beam are

mixing schemes of particle states and decay constants are not only related but
also determined exclusively by the kinetic and mass Lagrangian densities. In
the general case, these are bilinear in terms of the intrinsic fields and
involve non-diagonal kinetic and mass matrices. By applying three consecutive
steps this Lagrangian can be reduced into the standard quadratic form in terms
of the physical fields. These steps are : (i) the diagonalization of the
kinetic matrix, (ii) rescaling of the fields, and (iii) the diagonalization of
the mass matrix. In case, where the dimensions of the non-diagonal kinetic and
mass sub-matrices are respectively, $k\times k$ and $n\times n$, this procedure
leads to mixing schemes which involve $[k(k-1)/2] + [n(n-1)/2]$ angles and $k$
field rescaling parameters. This observation holds true irrespective with the
type of particle interactions presumed. The commonly used mixing schemes,
correspond to a proper choice of the kinetic and mass matrices, and are derived

new model for the QCD analytic running coupling is proposed. A self-evident
advantage of the new analytic running coupling (NARC) is that it incorporates
the infrared enhancement and the ultraviolet asymptotic freedom in a single
expression. It is essential that additional parameters are not introduced in
the theory. The absence of unphysical singularities in the physical region
$q^2>0$ and a fairly well loop and scheme stability are the remarkable features
of the NARC. By making use of practically the same values of $\Lambda_{QCD}$ in
the approach developed, one succeeded in description of various physical
phenomena, from quark confinement to the $\tau$ lepton decay. This undoubtedly
implies that the new analytic running coupling substantially involves both the
nonperturbative and the perturbative behavior of Quantum Chromodynamics.

Sitter space is derived both from the conformal anomaly and the transformation
law of the CFT stress tensor when going from dS_3 in planar coordinates to dS_3
with cosmological horizon. The two-point correlator for CFT operators coupling
to bulk scalars is obtained in static coordinates, corresponding to a CFT on a
cylinder. Correlation functions are also computed for CFTs on two-dimensional
hyperbolic space. We furthermore determine the energy momentum tensor and the
Casimir energy of the conformal field theory dual to the Schwarzschild-de
Sitter solution in five dimensions. Requiring the pressure to be positive
yields an upper bound for the black hole mass, given by the mass of the Nariai
solution. Beyond that bound, which is similar to the one found by Strominger
requiring the conformal weights of CFT operators to be real, one encounters
naked singularities.

twin primes that consists of three essential elements. These are: that the
twins are most naturally viewed as a subsequence of the primes themselves, that
the likelihood of a particular prime in sequence being the first element of a
twin is akin to a fixed-probability random event, and that this probability
varies with $\pi_{1}$, the count of primes up to this number, in a simple way.
Our initial studies made use of two unproven assumptions: that it was
consistent to model this fundamentally discrete system with a continuous
probability density, and that the fact that an upper-bound cut-off for prime
separations exists could be consistently ignored in the continuous analysis.
The success of the model served as a posteriori justification for these
assumptions. Here we perform the analysis using a discrete formalism -- not
passing to integrals -- and explicitly include a self-consistently defined
cut-off. In addition, we reformulate the model so as to minimise the input data
needed.

fan in the theory of toric variety in algebraic geometry. Roughly speaking a
toric variety is an algebraic variety with an action of algebraic torus of the

associated with the toric variety. Algebro-geometric properties of the toric
variety can be described in terms of the associated fan. We develop a
combinatorial theory of multi-fans and define ``topological invariants'' of a
multi-fan. A smooth manifold with an action of a compact torus of half the
dimension of the manifold and with some orientation data is called a torus
manifold. We associate a multi-fan with a torus manifold, and apply the
combinatorial theory to describe topological invariants of the torus manifold.
A similar theory is also given for torus orbifolds. As a related subject a
generalization of the Ehrhart polynomial concerning the number of lattice

ergodic but not mixing. Their quantum spectral statistics shows non-generic
behaviour, i.e.it does not follow random matrix theory (RMT). By coupling the
map to a spin 1/2, which corresponds to changing the quantisation without
altering the classical limit of the dynamics on the torus, we numerically
observe a transition to RMT statistics. The results are interpreted in terms of
semiclassical trace formulae for the maps with and without spin respectively.
We thus have constructed quantum systems with non-mixing classical limit which
show generic (i.e. RMT) spectral statistics. We also discuss the analogous
situation for an almost integrable map, where we compare to Semi-Poissonian

The apparent suppression of annihilation upon increasing the atomic charge $Z$
and mass number $A$ is resolved as due to the strong effective repulsion
produced by the very absorptive optical potential which keeps the $\bar
p$-nucleus wavefunction substantially outside the nuclear surface, so that the
resulting reaction cross section saturates as function of the strength of Im
$V_{{\rm opt}}$. This feature, for $E >0$, parallels the recent prediction, for
$E < 0$, that the level widths of $\bar p$ atoms saturate and, hence, that
$\bar p$ deeply bound atomic states are relatively narrow. Predictions are made
for $\bar p$ annihilation cross sections over the entire periodic table at
these very low energies and the systematics of the calculated cross sections as
function of $A$, $Z$ and $E$ are discussed and explained in terms of a
Coulomb-modified strong-absorption model. Finally, optical potentials which fit
simultaneously low-energy $\bar p - ^4$He observables for $E < 0$ as well as
for $E > 0$ are used to assess the reliability of extracting Coulomb modified
