evidence of strong interactions based on optical morphologies. For these
galaxies, a substantial fraction, usually more than 50%, of the infrared
luminosity is generated in regions ranging in sizes from 100pc -- 1 Kpc.
Nuclear starbursts often dominate the infrared luminosity, but this is not
always true. In some galaxies, most notably NGC 6090, substantial infrared
luminosity greatly in excess of the nuclear luminosity is generated in regions
associated with the physical interaction between two galaxies. The radio
emission is a good tracer of the location of high luminosity young stars. The
visual/ultraviolet radiation output of the nearby star forming galaxies is
dominated by emission from regions that are generally not producing the copious
infrared luminosity of the systems. The regions of high infrared luminosity in
local starburst galaxies are significantly smaller than the galaxies as a
whole. The integrated spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these galaxies
are very different from the SEDs of the regions of star formation. If the SEDs
of star-forming regions in these galaxies reflect the SEDs found in forming
galaxies at high redshift, the distant galaxies should be dominated by the mid
and far-infrared luminosity output far more than the integrated luminous output
of nearby starburst galaxies would suggest.

us to compare `spinor connections'.

mechanics. An entangled state of a system consisting of two subsystems cannot
be described as a product of the quantum states of the two subsystems. In this
sense the entangled system is considered inseparable and nonlocal. It is
generally believed that entanglement manifests itself mostly in systems
consisting of a small number of microscopic particles. Here we demonstrate
experimentally the entanglement of two objects, each consisting of about 10^12
atoms. Entanglement is generated via interaction of the two objects - more
precisely, two gas samples of cesium atoms - with a pulse of light, which
performs a non-local Bell measurement on collective spins of the samples. The
entangled spin state can be maintained for 0.5 millisecond. Besides being of
fundamental interest, the robust, long-lived entanglement of material objects
demonstrated here is expected to be useful in quantum information processing,
including teleportation of quantum states of matter and quantum memory.
