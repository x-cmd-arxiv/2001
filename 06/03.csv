it is proposed that masses of baryonic plasma (``cannonballs''), ejected in
bipolar supernova explosions in our Galaxy are the sources of hadronic Galactic
cosmic rays (CRs) at all energies. The propagation of the cannonballs in the
Galactic disk and halo is studied. Two mechanisms for the acceleration of the
observed CRs are proposed. The first is based on ultrarelativistic shocks in
the interstellar medium and could accelerate the bulk of CRs up to the ``knee''
energy of 4 x 10(15) eV. The second operates with second-order Fermi
acceleration within the cannonball. If the total initial energy of the ejected
plasmoids in a SN explosion is 10(53) ergs or higher this second mechanism may
explain the CR spectrum above the knee up to the highest observed energies. It
is shown that together with plausible assumptions about CR propagation in the
Galactic confinement volume the observed spectral indices of the CR spectrum
can be theoretically understood to first order. The model allows a natural
understanding of various basic CR observations like the absence of the
Greisen-Zatsepin cutoff, the anisotropy of arrival directions as function of
energy and the small Galactocentric gradient of the CR density.

the Galactic super-luminal jet sources share the common spectral characteristic
that they have extremely high disk temperatures which cannot be explained in
the framework of the standard accretion disk model in the Schwarzschild metric.
We examine several possibilities to solve this ``too-hot'' disk problem. In
particular, we have calculated an extreme Kerr disk model to fit the observed
spectra. We found that the Kerr disk will become significantly harder compared
to the Schwarzschild disk only when the disk is highly inclined. For
super-luminal jet sources, which are known to be inclined systems, the Kerr
disk model may work if we choose proper values for the black hole angular
momentum. For the ULXs, however, the Kerr disk interpretation will be
problematic, as it is highly unlikely that their accretion disks are
preferentially inclined.

basis function (RBF) approach. First, we will introduce a new scheme employing
the boundary knot method (BKM) to nonlinear convection-diffusion problem. It is
stressed that the new scheme directly results in a linear BKM formulation of
nonlinear problems by using response point-dependent RBFs, which can be solved
by any linear solver. Then we only need to solve a single nonlinear algebraic
equation for desirable unknown at some inner node of interest. The numerical
results demonstrate high accuracy and efficiency of this nonlinear BKM
strategy. Second, we extend the concepts of distance function, which include
time-space and variable transformation distance functions. Finally, we
demonstrate that if the nodes are symmetrically placed, the RBF coefficient
matrices have either centrosymmetric or skew centrosymmetric structures. The
factorization features of such matrices lead to a considerable reduction in the
RBF computing effort. A simple approach is also presented to reduce the
ill-conditioning of RBF interpolation matrices in general cases.

first time phenomenological models involving quantum-gravity ideas are
competing on level ground with other new-physics proposals clearly marks the
beginning of a new stage of quantum-gravity research. I emphasize one important
aspect of this new phenomenology: combining the determination of the relevant
thresholds with data on the time/energy structure of gamma-ray bursts it is
possible to distinguish between alternative quantum-gravity scenarios. This
point is illustrated focusing on 3 specific scenarios: dispersion-inducing

is made on the level of the conformal-invariant angle of the dilaton-Higgs

equivalence principle. We show that the lowest order of the linearized

cosmic creation of $W,Z$-vector bosons due to their mass singularity. In the

hidden features of 1T-physics. One such hidden feature is that families of
apparently different 1T-dynamical systems in d dimensions holographically
describe the same 2T system in d+2 dimensions. In 2T-physics there are two
timelike dimensions, but there is also a crucial gauge symmetry that thins out
spacetime, thus making 2T-physics effectively equivalent to 1T-physics. The
gauge symmetry is also responsible for ensuring causality and unitarity in a

unification of diverse 1T dynamics by making manifest hidden symmetries and
relationships among them. Such symmetries and relationships is the evidence for
the presence of the underlying higher dimensional spacetime structure.
2T-physics could be viewed as a device for gaining a better understanding of
1T-physics, but beyond this, 2T-physics offers new vistas in the search of the
unified theory while raising deep questions about the meaning of spacetime. In
these lectures, the recent developments in the powerful gauge field theory
formulation of 2T-physics will be described after a brief review of the results
obtained so far in the more intuitive worldline approach.

a pure R^4 term with a coupling constant. Starting from the off-shell solution
of the Bianchi identities, we compute the on-shell torsions and curvatures with
this term. We show that their complete solution includes, for some of them, an
infinite series in the R^4 coupling constant, which can only be computed
iteratively. We explicitly compute the superspace torsions and curvatures up to
second order in this coupling constant. Finally, we comment on the lifting of
this result to higher dimensions.
