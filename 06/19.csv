shocking of an ultra-relativistic shell of protons with the interstellar medium
(ISM). Any neutrons originally present in the GRB fireball may, depending on
the characteristics of the central engine, dynamically decouple as the fireball
accelerates. This leads to outflow consisting of separate fast proton and slow
neutron components. We derive detailed implications of neutron decoupling for
the observed lightcurves of short bursts. We show that the collision of a
neutron decayed shell with a decelerating outer shell is expected to result in
an observable second peak in the GRB lightcurve. There may be substantial
optical emission associated with such an event, so the upcoming Swift satellite
may be able to place constraints on models for short bursts. We also discuss
interesting inferences about central engine characteristics allowed by existing
BATSE data and a consideration of neutron decoupling.

spiral galaxies of the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey, in order to investigate the
relationships between dust extinction, metallicity and some macroscopic
properties of spiral galaxies. We found a very strong correlation between the
Hbeta and Halpha equivalent widths, implying that the difference between the
extinction of the stellar and the nebular light depends only on the intrinsic
colours of the galaxies, being larger for redder galaxies. The usual
metallicity indicator for giant HII regions ([OIII]4959,5007 + [OII]3726,3729)/
Hbeta is not appropriate for integrated spectra of spiral galaxies, probably
due to metallicity gradients. Much better qualitative metallicity indicators
are found to be [NII]6584/[OII]3726,3729 and [NII]6584/Halpha, the latter
having the advantage of being independent of reddening and being applicable
also for galaxies with weak emission lines. With these indicators, we find that
the nebular extinction as derived from the Balmer decrement strongly correlates
with the effective metallicity of the emission line regions. The overall
metallicity of the emission line regions is much better correlated with galaxy
colours than with morphological types. A Principal Component Analysis on a 7-D
parameter space showed that the variance is produced, in first place, by the
metallicity and parameters linked to the stellar populations, and, in second
place, by the surface brightness, which is linked to the dynamical history of
the galaxies. The absolute magnitude, related to the mass of the galaxy, comes
only in the third place.

arcsec resolution of the data allows us to detect a very complex and asymmetric
structure of the halo with respect to the optical galaxy. Moreover the analysis
of the radial structure reveals the presence of a multi-component profile not
consistent with a simple King model over the whole 40 Kpc. We do not detect the
presence of a central source and pose an upper limit to the luminosity of a
possible active nucleus. Due to the length of the observation, comparable to
that of a deep survey, we detect a large number of sources within the HRI FOV,
in slight excess with respect to the estimates based on previous surveys. We
study the flux distribution of the sources, their temporal behaviour and their
spatial distribution with respect to the central galaxy.

Such objects are readily detected in 1/4 keV surveys; the sample reported here

spectra of the Seyfert galaxies were gathered for correlative analysis, which
confirmed the well-known relations between X-ray slope and optical spectral
properties (e.g., [O III]/H-beta ratio; Fe II strength, H-beta width). The
various intercorrelations are most likely driven, fundamentally, by the shape
of the photoionising continuum in Seyfert nuclei. We argue that a steep X-ray

towards the halo in all three galaxies requires an increase either in electron
temperature or in oxygen abundance. Keeping the oxygen abundance constant
yields the most reasonable results for temperature, abundances, and ionization

angles.
  In the optical the spectrum is dominated by direct starlight which decreases
exponentially due to the linear extinction.
  Scattered light begins to be noticeable in the near-UV. The near-UV rise of
the scattered light is interrupted in the bump region. The wavelength
dependence of the scattered light is established in the far-UV, where scattered
light dominates the extinction curve. A 1/lambda^4 dependence is found, proving
the presence of grains small compared to UV wavelengths.

the exponential optical extinction extends to the UV, and the spectrum of stars

effects including the cosmological dimming of surface brightness, to avoid any
systematic bias which may be the origin of controversy in previously published
results. We also tried to be very careful about systematic model uncertainties;
we present a comprehensive surveys of these systematic uncertainties and
dependence on various parameters. We found that the pure luminosity evolution
(PLE) model is well consistent with all the SDF data down to K~22.5, without
any evidence for number or size evolution in a low-density, Lambda-dominated
flat universe which is now favored by various cosmological observations. If the
popular Lambda-dominated universe is taken for granted, our result then gives a
strong constraint on the number evolution of giant elliptical or early-type
galaxies to z~1-2 which must be met by any models in the hierarchically
clustering universe, since such galaxies are the dominant population in this
magnitude range (K<~22.5). In the fainter magnitude range of K>~22.5, we found
a slight excess of observed counts over the prediction of the PLE model when
elliptical galaxies are treated as a single population. We suggest that this
discrepancy reflects some number evolution of dwarf galaxies and/or the
distinct populations of giant and dwarf elliptical galaxies which have been
known for local elliptical galaxies.

PEGASE v2.0 and STARBURST99 codes to generate the spectral energy distribution

STARBURST99 uses the Geneva group tracks, allowing comparison between the two.
We used our MAPPINGS III code to compute photoionization models which include a
self-consistent treatment of dust physics and chemical depletion. We use the
standard optical diagnostic diagrams as indicators of the hardness of the EUV
radiation field in these galaxies. These diagnostic diagrams are most sensitive
to the spectral index of the ionizing radiation field in the 1-4 Rydberg
region. We find that warm infrared starburst galaxies contain a relatively hard
EUV field in this region. The PEGASE ionizing stellar continuum is harder in
the 1-4 Rydberg range than that of STARBURST99. As the spectrum in this regime
is dominated by emission from Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars, this difference is most
likely due to the differences in stellar atmosphere models used for the W-R
stars. We believe that the stellar atmospheres in STARBURST99 are more
applicable to the starburst galaxies in our sample, however they do not produce
the hard EUV field in the 1-4 Rydberg region required by our observations. The
inclusion of continuum metal blanketing in the models may be one solution.
Supernova remnant (SNR) shock modeling shows that the contribution by
mechanical energy from SNRs to the photoionization models is << 20%. The models
presented here are used to derive a new theoretical classification scheme for
starbursts and AGN galaxies based on the optical diagnostic diagrams.

  this meeting ""FIRST"" was renamed ""Herschel""",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We discuss some of the practical considerations that need to be made in the
design of extra-galactic field surveys using FIRST. We investigate the various
limitations that confusion noise imposes on possible FIRST surveys and the
benefits of super resolution or decconvolution techniques. We consider the
possible sizes and depths of survey fields in order to meet many of the
scientific objectives of the FIRST mission. In particular we discuss the
factors that need to be taken into account in selecting the survey fields. The
final choice of fields will be influenced by the location of other surveys that
are currently being planned; so it is vital that the FIRST community begin
debating this issue now. We conclude that a substantial survey of order of 100
square degrees is likely to be sited in the region of the SIRTF Legacy survey,
SWIRE.

amplitude, pulsating stars such as the well known Cepheid stars are regular.
However, a smaller group of variable stars that are located next to them in the
Hertzsprung- Russell diagram undergoes irregular light variations and exhibits
irregular radial velocities as well. The mechanism behind this irregular
behavior was a long standing mystery. A flow reconstruction technique based on
the observed lightcurves of six separate stars shows that their underlying
dynamics is chaotic and low dimensional (d=4). Furthermore, we present evidence
that the physical mechanism behind the behavior is the nonlinear interaction of
just two pulsation eigenmodes. In a generalized Shil'nikov scenario, the
pulsation energy alternates continuously, but irregularly between a lower
frequency mode that is linearly unstable and thus growing, and a stable
overtone that gets entrained through a low order resonance (2:1), but that
wants to decay. The flow reconstruction from the stellar light curve thus
yields interesting physical insight into the pulsation mechanism.

cosmological model were presented on the (1) foundations, (2) new source of
gravity, and (3) large-scale structure. In this paper predictions will include
new physical features that are due mostly to the postulated geometry of our
closed 3-D universe. Knowledge of the past universe is obtained from its many
types of radiation that travel to our instruments on great circles of our
expanding 3-sphere. Adding the fourth spatial dimension greatly increases our
understanding of the concepts of emission and reception distances of the
sources and 4-D trajectory of the radiation. In a closed expanding 3-D
universe, most of the radiation from a distant bright source at Ze can travel
halfway around the universe and be refocused as a ""virtual source"" at Zv ~1.5
where some of the re-diverging radiation arrives later to our instruments. With
the added fourth dimension, the SC-model makes some spectacular predictions for
these virtual sources. Indeed, the CBR becomes a re-focused ""backside""
microwave radiation with its structure amplified in size and decreased in
luminosity by a factor ~ 1/350. ""Viewed"" in the optical from a direction
opposite the CBR, the same, but more evolved, structure at ""virtual Zsame""
would certainly fix the geometry and size of our universe. Virtual sources are
also added radiation to the diffuse background of X-rays and infrared. The CBR
dipole suggests a preferred reference frame. Reflected light signals in a
non-accelerated frame show, in principle, the moving frame could be brought to
rest in the comoving frame.

of the details of the accretion, the bound but unaccreted gas has been
accumulating in the potential well of Sgr A* for <1000 yrs and thus is not in
equilibrium. Otherwise, the gas flows of the region would be visible in both
the IR and X-ray. It appears that the blackhole was more active in the recent
past due to the passing of a supernova blast shock but is presently in a
short-lived dormant phase. The extended low frequency radio emission from the
central parsec should visibily increase over the next few decades, as the shock
passes completely in front of the absorbing gas and dust near Sgr A*. The GC
may become more active in < 100,000 yrs due to either another supernova or
sufficient accumulation of stellar winds in the central arcsecond.

Holstein model. We demonstrate how ME theory has a phase-transition-like
instability at intermediate coupling, and how the Engelsberg--Schrieffer (ES)
picture is complicated by low-energy excitations from higher order diagrams
(demonstrating that ES theory is a very weak coupling approach). Through
consideration of the lowest-order vertex correction, we analyse the
applicability of ME theory close to this transition. We find a breakdown of the
theory in the intermediate coupling adiabatic limit due to a divergence in the
vertex function. The region of applicability is mapped out, and it is found
that ME theory is only reliable in the weak coupling adiabatic limit, raising
questions about the accuracy of recent analyses of cuprate superconductors

interactions between neighbouring chains in a dense solution or melt.
Entanglements can be treated in a mean field approach, within the famous
reptation model, since they effectively confine each individual chain in a
tube-like geometry. In polymer networks, due to crosslinks preventing the
reptation constraint release, entanglements acquire a different topological
meaning and have a much stronger effect on the resulting mechanical response.
We apply the classical ideas of reptation dynamics to calculate the effective
rubber-elastic free energy of an entangled rubbery network. We then compare the
results with other theoretical approaches and establish a particularly close
mapping with the hoop-model, with equally good description of experimental
data. The present consistent reptation theory allows further development of
dynamic theory of stress relaxation.

possibly corresponding to a long-lived neutral particle with only weak
interactions and which decays to muon pairs. We show that this can {\it not} be
explained by pair production of neutralinos in the target followed by their
decay far downstream in the detector via a $LLE$ R-parity violating (RPV)
operator, as suggested in the literature. In the parameter region allowed by
LEP the event rate is far too small. We propose instead a new neutralino
production method via $B$-mesons, which can fully explain the observation. This
is analogous to neutrino production via $\pi$-mesons. This model can be
completely tested and thus also possibly excluded with NOMAD data. If it is
excluded, the NuTeV observation is most likely not due to physics beyond the
Standard Model. Our model can also be tested at the current and future
$B$-factories. This opens up a new way of testing a long-lived neutralino LSP
at fixed-target experiments and thus a possibility to close the gap between
collider and cosmological tests of R-parity violation. We also discuss a
possible explanation in terms of a neutral heavy lepton mixing with the
Standard Model neutrinos. The flavour structure of the observation can be

anomalies in any even dimension, which satisfies the Wess-Zumino consistency
condition by construction. The method relies on defining the coboundary
operator of the local Weyl group, and giving a cohomological interpretation to
counterterms in the effective action in dimensional regularization with respect
to this group. Non-trivial cocycles of the Weyl group arise from local
functionals that are Weyl invariant in and only in the physical even integer
dimension. In the physical dimension the non-trivial cocycles generate
covariant non-local action functionals characterized by sensitivity to global
Weyl rescalings. The non-local action so obtained is unique up to the addition
of trivial cocycles and Weyl invariant terms, both of which are insensitive to
global Weyl rescalings. These distinct behaviors under rigid dilations can be
used to distinguish between infrared relevant and irrelevant operators in a
generally covariant manner. Variation of the $d=4$ non-local effective action
yields two new conserved geometric stress tensors with local traces. The method
may be extended to any even dimension by making use of the general construction
of conformal invariants given by Fefferman and Graham. As a corollary,
conformal field theory behavior of correlators at the asymptotic infinity of
either anti-de Sitter or de Sitter spacetimes follows, i.e. AdS$_{d+1}$ or
deS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_d$ correspondence. The same construction naturally selects all
infrared relevant terms (and only those terms) in the low energy effective
action of gravity in any even integer dimension. The infrared relevant terms
arising from the known anomalies in d=4 imply that the classical Einstein
theory is modified at large distances.

p_{2n}$ where $x_{2n}$ are the positions of the even string modes, and $p_{2n}$
are related to the Fourier space of the odd modes $x_{2n+1}$ up to a linear

used in the intermediate steps to establish the map from Witten's star-product
to Moyal's star-product. An ambiguity related to the midpoint in the split

  (Kluwer Pub)",,,,"hep-th astro-ph gr-qc hep-ph",,"  We present a minimal model for the Universe evolution fully extracted from
effective String Theory. This model is by its construction close to the
standard cosmological evolution, and it is driven selfconsistently by the
evolution of the string equation of state itself. The inflationary String
Driven stage is able to reach enough inflation, describing a Big Bang like
evolution for the metric. By linking this model to a minimal but well
established observational information, (the transition times of the different
cosmological epochs), we prove that it gives realistic predictions on early and
current energy density and its results are compatible with General Relativity.
Interestingly enough, the predicted current energy density is found Omega = 1
and a lower limit Omega \geq 4/9 is also found. The energy density at the exit
of the inflationary stage also gives | Omega |_{inf}=1. This result shows an
agreement with General Relativity (spatially flat metric gives critical energy
density) within an inequivalent Non-Einstenian context (string low energy
effective equations). The order of magnitude of the energy density-dilaton
coupled term at the beginning of the radiation dominated stage agrees with the
GUT scale. The predicted graviton spectrum is computed and analyzed without any
free parameters. Peaks and asymptotic behaviours of the spectrum are a direct
consequence of the dilaton involved and not only of the scale factor evolution.
Drastic changes are found at high frequencies: the dilaton produces an
increasing spectrum (in no string cosmologies the spectrum is decreasing).
Without solving the known problems about higher order corrections and graceful
exit of inflation, we find this model closer to the observational Universe than
the current available string cosmology scenarii.

quantization, is proposed. Applying to nonlinear scalar field, the WL -scheme
is investigated and compared with the conventional PA-scheme of quantization.
In the PA-scheme objects of quantization are particles and antiparticles, which
are fragments of the total physical object -- world line (WL). Applying to the
nonlinear field, the PA-scheme of quantization leads to such difficulties as
nonstationary vacuum, obligatory use of perturbation theory technique, normal
ordering and cut-off in the scattering problem. These difficulties are
corollaries of inconsistency of PA-scheme. The WL-scheme is free of these
difficulties. These difficulties are connected with the reconstruction problem
of the total world lines from their fragments (particles and antiparticles). In
the case, when these fragments interact between themselves, such a
reconstruction is very complicated problem. The new WL-scheme of quantization
is free of all these problems, because it does not cut the total world line
into fragments (particles and antiparticles). Formally appearance of fragments
in the conventional quantization PA-scheme is a corollary of identification of
the energy with the Hamiltonian. In fact such an identification is not
necessary. It leads only to difficulties. The new WL-scheme of quantization
does not use this identification and enables to go around all these problems.
The WL-scheme enables not to use additional (to nonrelativistic QM)
quantization rules, used in the relativistic QFT (normal ordering, perturbation
technique, renormalization).

  Comparison of \phi^CC(nu_e) to the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration's precision
value of \phi^ES(\nu_x) yields a 3.3 sigma difference, providing evidence that
there is a non-electron flavor active neutrino component in the solar flux. The
total flux of active ^8B neutrinos is thus determined to be 5.44 +/-0.99 x

processes without a birth process that will generate the Dirac equation in 1+1
dimensions. The Markov process is assumed to evolve in an extra (ordinal) time
dimension. The derivation requires that occupation by the Dirac particle of a
space-time lattice site is encoded in a 4 state classical probability vector.
Disregarding the state occupancy, the resulting Markov process is a homogeneous
and almost isotropic binary random walk in Dirac space and Dirac time
(including Dirac time reversals). It then emerges that the Dirac wavefunction
can be identified with a polarization induced by the walk on the Dirac
space-time lattice. The model predicts that QM observation must happen in
ordinal time, and that wavefunction collapse is due not to a dynamical
discontinuity, but to selection of a particular ordinal time. Consequently, the
model is more relativistically equitable in its treatment of space and time in
that the observer is attributed no special ability to specify the Dirac time of
observation.

Feynman approach to quantum theory in combination with the canonical approach

case of such interactions. In this way, using only the current concepts of
quantum theory, a generalized equation of motion for state vectors is derived.
In the case, where the fundamental interaction generating the dynamics in a

proposed formalism is shown to provide a new insight into the problem of the
