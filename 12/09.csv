detection of an handful of them. The knowledge of the level of the TeV emission
and its spectrum can shed light on the particle acceleration mechanisms, and it
is especially important to assess the still uncertain level of the far infrared
background radiation, which can absorb the TeV photons through photon--photon
interactions. In view of these implications, it is necessary to enlarge the
number of TeV detected sources, and to find them at different redshifts. To
this aim, we propose a general and simple criterium to select the best TeV
candidates, and produce a list of them with flux estimates above 40 GeV, 300
GeV and 1 TeV.

discovered shell GSH 238+00+09 (and other nearby extremely energetic
supershells) on the earth's atmosphere. We argue that the large flux of gammas
from these specific events would have provoked major catastrophes to living
organisms. The lack of evidence for the latter can then be used to rule out
local isotropic nearby GRBs in the last tens of Myr and another origin for
large supershells is likely. Alternatively, this argument may be taken as
independent evidence for beaming of the gamma rays, although statistics are not
yet sufficient to constrain the beaming angle better than $\sim$ tens of
degrees. The effects of less-energetic events of the type of SN1998bw are also
considered. It is shown that more than a dozen of them should have occurred
within $40 (E/10^{48} erg)^{1/2} pc$ of the earth in the last 500 Myr with
similar effects. Beaming of the latter would also alleviate the conflict,
although another likely possibility (an actual rate much smaller than $10^{-4}
yr^{-1}$) may be a solution, at the same time avoiding an excessive number of
supershells active in the galaxy.

Contrary to some earlier studies based on global fluxes, we find that the SFR
surface density exhibits a much stronger correlation with the H_2 than with the
HI, as the HI surface density saturates at a value of $\sim$10 Msol pc^{-2} or
even declines at large SFR surface densities. Hence the good correlation
between the SFR surface density and the total (HI+H_2) gas surface density is
driven by the molecular component in these galaxies. We find no clear evidence
for a link between the gravitational instability parameter for the gas disk
(Q_g) and the SFR, and suggest that Q_g be considered a measure of the gas
fraction. This implies that for a state of marginal gravitational stability to
exist in galaxies with low gas fractions, it must be due to instability of the
stellar disk. In regions where we have both HI and CO measurements, the ratio
of HI to H_2 surface density scales with radius R as roughly R^{1.5}, and we
suggest that the balance between HI and H_2 is determined primarily by the
midplane interstellar pressure. These results favor a ""law"" of star formation
in quiescent disks in which the ambient pressure and metallicity control the
formation of molecular clouds from HI, with star formation then occurring at a
roughly constant rate per unit H_2 mass. (abstract abridged)

relation in quantum phenomena. The assumption that there are no causal laws,
but only probabilities for physical processes constrained by symmetries, leads
naturally to quantum mechanics. In particular, an argument is made for why
there are probability amplitudes that are complex numbers, which obey the Born
rule for quantum probabilities. This argument generalizes the Feynman path
integral formulation of quantum mechanics to include all possible actions that
are allowed by symmetries, but only the lowest order terms are observable at
the presently accessible energy scales. The notion of relational reality is
introduced in order to give physical meaning to probabilities. This appears to
give rise to a new interpretation of quantum mechanics.

  appear in Physical Review A",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.66.032315",,"quant-ph",,"  It is known that unambiguous discrimination among non-orthogonal but linearly
independent quantum states is possible with a certain probability of success.
Here, we consider a variant of that problem. Instead of discriminating among
all of the different states, we shall only discriminate between two subsets of
them. In particular, for the case of three non-orthogonal states, we show that
the optimal strategy to distinguish between a set containing one of the states
from the set containing the other two has a higher success rate than if we wish
to discriminate among all three states. Somewhat surprisingly, for unambiguous
discrimination the subsets need not be linearly independent. A fully analytical
solution is presented, and we also show how to construct generalized
interferometers (multiports) that provide an optical implementation of the
optimal strategy.

Grassmann variables or Clifford algebras, but simply by generalizing the usual
spinless theory. We only assume the invariance with respect to the Poincare'
group; and only requiring the conservation of the linear and angular momenta we
derive the zitterbewegung: namely the decomposition of the 4-velocity in the
newtonian constant term p/m and in a non-newtonian time-oscillating spacelike
term. Consequently, free classical particles do not obey, in general, the
Principle of Inertia. Superluminal motions are also allowed, without violating
Special Relativity, provided that the energy-momentum moves along the worldline
of the center-of-mass. Moreover, a non-linear, non-constant relation holds
between the time durations measured in different reference frames. Newtonian
Mechanics is re-obtained as a particular case of the present theory: namely for
spinless systems with no zitterbewegung. Introducing a Lagrangian containing
also derivatives of the 4-velocity we get a new equation of the motion,
actually a generalization of the Newton Law a=F/m. Requiring the rotational
symmetry and the reparametrization invariance we derive the classical spin
vector and the conserved scalar Hamiltonian, respectively. We derive also the
classical Dirac spin and analyze the general solution of the Eulero-Lagrange
equation for Dirac particles. The interesting case of spinning systems with
zero intrinsic angular momentum is also studied.

entropy with time in model spin systems decohered by a spin bath. In some
experimentally relevant cases, the oscillations of considerable amplitude can
persist long after the entropy has saturated near its maximum, i.e. when the
system has been decohered almost completely. Therefore, the pointer states of
the system demonstrate non-trivial dynamics. The oscillations exhibit slow
power-law decay, rather than exponential or Gaussian, and may be observable in
experiments.
