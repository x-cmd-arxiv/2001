  expanded",,"10.1086/340759",,"astro-ph",,"  We have performed a search for halo white dwarfs as high proper motion
objects in a second epoch WFPC2 image of the Groth-Westphal strip. We identify
24 high proper motion objects with mu > 0.014 ''/yr. Five of these high proper
motion objects are identified as strong white dwarf candidates on the basis of
their position in a reduced proper motion diagram. We create a model of the
Milky Way thin disk, thick disk and stellar halo and find that this sample of
white dwarfs is clearly an excess above the < 2 detections expected from these
known stellar populations. The origin of the excess signal is less clear.
Possibly, the excess cannot be explained without invoking a fourth galactic
component: a white dwarf dark halo. We present a statistical separation of our
sample into the four components and estimate the corresponding local white
dwarf densities using only the directly observable variables, V, V-I, and mu.
For all Galactic models explored, our sample separates into about 3 disk white
dwarfs and 2 halo white dwarfs. However, the further subdivision into the thin
and thick disk and the stellar and dark halo, and the subsequent calculation of
the local densities are sensitive to the input parameters of our model for each
Galactic component. Using the lowest mean mass model for the dark halo we find
a 7% white dwarf halo and six times the canonical value for the thin disk white
dwarf density (at marginal statistical significance), but possible systematic
errors due to uncertainty in the model parameters likely dominate these
statistical error bars. The white dwarf halo can be reduced to around 1.5% of
the halo dark matter by changing the initial mass function slightly. The local
thin disk white dwarf density in our solution can be made consistent with the
canonical value by assuming a larger thin disk scaleheight of 500 pc.

have halos with a universal, self-similar equilibrium structure whose

then merging hierarchically.
  The structural properties of dark-matter dominated halos of different masses,

bow-shocks around high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). Their high space
velocities, recently confirmed with Hipparcos observations, combined with their
strong stellar winds should result in the formation of wind bow-shocks. Except
for the already known bow-shock around Vela X-1 (Kaper et al. 1997), we do not
find convincing evidence for a bow-shock around any of the other HMXBs. Also in
the case of (supposedly single) OB-runaway stars, only a minority appears to be
associated with a bow-shock (Van Buren et al. 1995). We investigate why wind
bow-shocks are not detected for the majority of these OB-runaway systems: is
this due to the IRAS sensitivity, the system's space velocity, the stellar-wind
properties, or the height above the galactic plane? It turns out that none of
these suggested causes can explain the low detection rate (~40%). We propose
that the conditions of the interstellar medium mainly determine whether a wind
bow-shock is formed or not. In hot, tenuous media (like inside galactic
superbubbles) the sound speed is high (~100 km/s), such that many runaways move
at subsonic velocity through a low-density medium, thus preventing the
formation of an observable bow-shock. Superbubbles are expected (and observed)
around OB associations, where the OB-runaway stars were once born. Turning the
argument around, we use the absence (or presence) of wind bow-shocks around OB
runaways to probe the physical conditions of the interstellar medium in the
solar neighbourhood.

the dark matter distribution in the Universe directly and thus to probe
cosmological models. The recent detection of cosmic shear by several groups has
demonstrated the feasibility of this new mode of observational cosmology. In
the currently most extensive analysis of cosmic shear, it was found that the
shear field contains unexpected modes, so-called B-modes, which are thought to
be unaccountable for by lensing. B-modes can in principle be generated by an
intrinsic alignment of galaxies from which the shear is measured, or may
signify some remaining systematics in the data reduction and analysis. In this
paper we show that B-modes in fact {\it are produced} by lensing itself. The
effect comes about through the clustering of source galaxies, which in
particular implies an angular separation-dependent clustering in redshift.
After presenting the theory of the decomposition of a general shear field into
E- and B-modes, we calculate their respective power spectra and correlation
functions for a clustered source distribution. Numerical and analytical
estimates of the relative strength of these two modes show that the resulting
B-mode is very small on angular scales larger than a few arcminutes, but its
relative contribution rises quickly towards smaller angular scales, with
comparable power in both modes at a few arcseconds. The relevance of this
effect with regard to the current cosmic shear surveys is discussed.

accretion disc and a massive companion with a coplanar orbit is the vertical
component of the tidal force. As shown by Lubow, the response of the disc to
vertical forcing is resonant at certain radii, at which a localized torque is
exerted, and from which a compressive wave (p mode) may be emitted. Although
these vertical resonances are weaker than the corresponding Lindblad
resonances, the m=2 inner vertical resonance in a binary star is typically
located within the tidal truncation radius of a circumstellar disc.
  In this paper I develop a general theory of vertical resonances, allowing for
non-linearity of the response, and dissipation by radiative damping and
turbulent viscosity. The problem is reduced to a universal, non-linear ordinary
differential equation with two real parameters. Solutions of the complex

remnants around Sgr A* that is based on a small sample of any type of Galactic
Center objects, provided they are substantially less massive than the black
holes and constitute part of an old (> 1 Gyr) population. The test relies on
the fact that, under the presence of such a cluster of heavy remnants and
because of energy equipartition, lower mass objects would be expelled from the
central regions and settle into a distribution very different than the cusp
expected to be induced by the supermassive black hole alone. We show that with
a sample of just 50 objects and using only their angular positions on the sky
relative to Sgr A* it is possible to clearly differentiate between a
distribution consistent with the presence of the cluster of black holes and a
power-law cusp distribution. We argue that millisecond pulsars might currently
be the best candidate to perform this test, because of the large uncertainties
involved in the age determination of less exotic objects. In addition, by
measuring their first and second period derivatives, millisecond pulsars offer
the rare opportunity of determining the complete phase space information of the
objects. We show that this extra information improves the detection of mass
segregation by about 30%.

the model results to the galaxy IZw18, which is a very metal-poor, gas-rich
dwarf galaxy, possibly experiencing its first or second burst of star
formation. We follow the evolution of a first weak burst of star formation
followed by a second more intense one occurring after several hundreds million
years. We find that a galactic wind develops only during the second burst and
that metals produced in the burst are preferentially lost relative to the
hydrogen gas. We predict the evolution of several chemical abundances (H, He,
C, N, O, \alpha-elements, Fe) in the gas inside and outside the galaxy, by
taking into account in detail the chemical and energetical contributions from
type II and Ia supernovae. We find that the abundances predicted for the star
forming region are in good agreement with the HII region abundances derived for
IZw18. We also predict the abundances of C, N and O expected for the HI gas to
be compared with future FUSE abundance determinations. We conclude that IZw18
must have experienced two bursts of star formation, one occurred \sim 300 Myr
ago and a present one with an age between 4-7 Myr. However, by taking into
account also other independent estimates, such as the color-magnitude diagram
and the spectral energy distribution of stars in IZw18, and the fact that real

state and of low-luminosity AGN possess many common features, the most
prominent being: compact, flat (or inverted) spectrum radio cores with high
brightness temperatures; excess red and infrared emission, often correlated
with the radio flux; an extremely weak (or absent) quasi-thermal hump and a
hard X-ray power-law with high energy cut-off. These sources are thought to be
accreting at low rates and advection (or convection) dominated accretion flows
are usually considered the best candidates to explain them. Here we present an
alternative possibility, involving strong, unbound, magnetic coronae generated
by geometrically thin, optically thick accretion discs at low accretion rates.
First we show that, if angular momentum transport in the disc is due to
magnetic turbulent stresses, the magnetic energy density and effective viscous
stresses inside the disc are proportional to the geometric mean of the total
(gas plus radiation) and gas pressure. Therefore the corona is less powerful in
a radiation pressure dominated disc, and the relative fraction of the power
liberated in the corona increases as the accretion rate decreases. Furthermore,
we discuss reasons why energetically dominant coronae are ideal sites for
launching powerful jets/outflows, both MHD and thermally driven. In analysing
the spectral properties of such coronal outflow dominated accretion discs, we
reach the important conclusion that if the jet/outflow is, as is likely,
radiatively inefficient, then so is the source overall, even without advection
of energy into the black hole being relevant for the dynamics of the accretion
flow.

Our results clearly indicates the s-wave character of the order parameter. The
temperature dependence of the surface resistance Rs below Tc/2 is consistent
with the low value of the energy gap. The surface resistance below 8 K was
found to be below the resolution limit of 100 microOhm of our measurement
technique.

typically less than $10^{-6}$, except that $\B(B^-\to p \bar\Delta^{--})\sim
1\times 10^{-6}$. In general, $\bar B\to N\bar\Delta>\bar B\to N\bar N$ due to
the large coupling constant for $\Sigma_b\to B\Delta$. For three-body modes we
focus on octet baryon final states. The leading three-dominated modes are $\bar
B^0\to p\bar n\pi^-(\rho^-), n\bar p\pi^+(\rho^+)$ with a branching ratio of
order $3\times 10^{-6}$ for $\bar B^0\to p\bar n\pi^-$ and $8\times 10^{-6}$

in the meson, e.g., $B^-\to p\bar p K^{-(*)}$ and $\bar B^0\to p\bar n
K^{-(*)}, n\bar n \bar K^{0(*)}$, have appreciable rates and the $N\bar N$ mass
spectrum peaks at low mass. The penguin-dominated modes containing a strange
baryon, e.g., $\bar B^0\to \Sigma^0\bar p\pi^+, \Sigma^-\bar n\pi^+$, have
branching ratios of order $(1\sim 4)\times 10^{-6}$. In contrast, the decay
rate of $\bar B^0\to\Lambda\bar p\pi^+$ is smaller. We explain why some of
charmless three-body final states in which baryon-antibaryon pair production is
accompanied by a meson have a larger rate than their two-body counterparts:
either the pole diagrams for the former have an anti-triplet bottom baryon
intermediate state, which has a large coupling to the $B$ meson and the

will be introduced in the present work. The main feature of this new approach
is to incorporate in a local sense the principle of general covariance of
general relativity, thus giving rise to the concept of a ""locally covariant
quantum field theory"". Such locally covariant quantum field theories will be
described mathematically in terms of covariant functors between the categories,
on one side, of globally hyperbolic spacetimes with isometric embeddings as
morphisms and, on the other side, of *-algebras with unital injective
*-endomorphisms as morphisms. Moreover, locally covariant quantum fields can be
described in this framework as natural transformations between certain
functors. The usual Haag-Kastler framework of nets of operator-algebras over a
fixed spacetime background-manifold, together with covariant automorphic
actions of the isometry-group of the background spacetime, can be re-gained
from this new approach as a special case. Examples of this new approach are
also outlined. In case that a locally covariant quantum field theory obeys the
time-slice axiom, one can naturally associate to it certain automorphic
actions, called ``relative Cauchy-evolutions'', which describe the dynamical
reaction of the quantum field theory to a local change of spacetime background
metrics. The functional derivative of a relative Cauchy-evolution with respect
to the spacetime metric is found to be a divergence-free quantity which has, as
will be demonstrated in an example, the significance of an energy-momentum
tensor for the locally covariant quantum field theory. Furthermore, we discuss
the functorial properties of state spaces of locally covariant quantum field
theories that entail the validity of the principle of local definiteness.

small level and archimedean type) does not have small zeroes, and vice-versa.
We prove that many types of automorphic L-functions have a lower first zero
than $\zeta$'s. This is done using Weil's explicit formula with
carefully-chosen test functions. When this method does not immediately show
L-functions of a certain type have low zeroes, we then attempt to turn the
tables and show no L-functions of that type exist. Thus the argument is a
combination of proving low zeroes exist and that certain cusp forms do not.
Consequently we are able to prove cohomological vanishing theorems and improve
upon existing bounds on the Laplace spectrum on $L^2(\quo n)$.

qubits are performed by swap gates and controlled swap gates. These operations
can be useful for quantum computers performing elementary arithmetic operations
such as multiplication and a bit-wise comparison of qubits.

  Interacting Quantum systems","18 pages, latex",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A self-consistent, non-perturbative scheme of approximation is proposed for
arbitrary interacting quantum systems by generalization of the Hartree
method.The scheme consists in approximating the original interaction term
$\lambda H_I$ by a suitable 'potential' $\lambda V(\phi)$ which satisfies the
following two requirements: (i) the 'Hartree Hamiltonian' $H_o$ generated by
$V(\phi)$ is exactly solvable i.e, the eigen states $|n>$ and the eigenvalues
$E_n$ are known and (ii) the 'quantum averages' of the two are equal, i.e. $<
n|H_I|n>$ = $<n|V(\phi)|n>$ for arbitrary $'n '$. The leading-order results for
$|n>$ and $E_n$, which are already accurate, can be systematically improved
further by the development of a 'Hartree-improved perturbation theory' (HIPT)
with $H_o$ as the unperturbed part and the modified interaction:$\lambda
H^{\prime} \equiv \lambda (H_I-V)$ as the perturbation. The HIPT is assured of
rapid convergence because of the 'Hartree condtion' : $<n| H'| n> = 0$. This is
in contrast to the naive perturbation theory developed with the original
interaction term $\lambda H_I$ chosen as the perturbation, which diverges even
for infinitesimal $\lambda$ ! The structure of the Hartree vacuum is shown to
be highly non-trivial. Application of the method to the anharmonic-and
double-well quartic-oscillators, anharmonic- sextic and octic- oscillators
leads to very accurate results for the energy levels. In case of $\lambda
\phi^{4}$ quantum field theory, the method reproduces, in the leading order,
the results of Gaussian approximation, which can be improved further by the
HIPT. We study the vacuum structure, renormalisation and stability of the
theory in GHA.

particle in a one-dimensional tilted time-dependent lattice. The description
uses the Wannier-Stark states, which are localized in each site of the lattice
and provides a simple framework leading to fully-analytical developments.
Particular attention is devoted to the case of a time-dependent potential,
which results in a rich variety of quantum coherent dynamics is found.
