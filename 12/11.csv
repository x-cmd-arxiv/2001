universe can be characterized by an equation of state p=w\rho with w<-1/3. A
number of observational tests have been proposed to study the value or redshift
dependence of w, including SN Ia distances, the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect,
cluster abundances, strong and weak gravitational lensing, galaxy and quasar
clustering, galaxy ages, the \lya forest, and CMB anisotropies. The proposed
observational tests based on these phenomena measure either the
distance-redshift relation d(z), the Hubble parameter H(z), the age of the
universe t(z), the linear growth factor D_1(z), or some combination of these
quantities. We compute the evolution of these four observables, and of the
combination H(z)d(z) that enters the Alcock-Paczyznski anisotropy test, in
models with constant w, in quintessence models with some simple forms of the
potential V(\phi), and in toy models that allow more radical time variations of
w. Measurement of any of these quantities to precision of a few percent is
generally sufficient to discriminate between w=-1 and w=-2/3. However, the
time-dependence predicted in quintessence models is extremely difficult to
discern because the quintessence component is dynamically unimportant at the
redshifts where w departs substantially from its low-z value. Even for the toy
models that allow substantial changes in w at low redshift, there is always a
constant-w model that produces very similar evolution of all of the observables
simultaneously. We conclude that measurement of the effective equation of state
of the dark energy may be achieved by several independent routes in the next
few years, but that detecting time-variation in this equation of state will
prove very difficult except in specialized cases.

ionization structure within ~7 arcsec (58 kpc) of the nucleus, where the

indicates that anisotropic illumination from the central AGN dominates on a
small scale. At larger distances (>10 arcsec) from the nucleus, low-ionization
emission gas is closely aligned with the radio axis, suggesting that jet-cloud
interactions may be the dominant mechanism in the line-emitting gas on a larger
scale. Moreover, the presence of a high-velocity cloud at 2.5 arcsec from the
nucleus, close to the radio axis, indicates that even close to the nucleus
jet-induced shocks have an important kinematic effect. While on a large scale
the low-ionization emission-line structures are aligned with the radio axis, on
a smaller scale, where AGN-photoionization dominates, the highest surface
brightness structure is aligned with the closest companion galaxy. This suggest
that much of the emission-line structure reflects the intrinsic gas
distribution, rather than the ionization pattern imprinted by the radio jets or
by AGN illumination. Overall, our results underline the need for a variety of

Large-amplitude, and highly coherent quasi-periodic oscillations (super-QPOs)
were observed on October 18, when superhumps were still growing in amplitude.
Most strikingly, the QPOs showed a rapid decrease of the period from 18 m to
6.8 m within the 3.2-hr observing run. Such a rapid change in the period has
not been observed in any class of QPOs in cataclysmic variables. We propose a

of the angular momentum from an orbiting blob in the accretion disk, via the
viscosity in a turbulent disk. A brief comparison is given with the QPOs in
X-ray binaries, some of which are known to show a similar rapid decrease in the

is responsible for the existence of two kinds of quasi-degenerated states. At
sufficiently high energy, pairs of symmetry-related states glue together to

particular quadruplets allow us to construct quantum states whose properties

numerically the quantum Hamiltonian, we investigate their properties and show
that such states are able to store the main part of the total energy on one of

necessarily introduces a periodic exchange of energy between them with a
frequency which is proportional to the energy splitting between
quasi-degenerated states related to the permutation symmetry. This splitting
may remain very small as the coupling strength increases and is a decreasing
function of the pair energy. The energy may be therefore stored in one pendulum

specific heat relaxation experiments are characterized by: (i) ``interrupted''
ageing (meaning that there is a maximal relaxation time); and (ii) a broad
power-law spectrum of relaxation times which is the signature of a collective
phenomenon. We propose a random energy model that can reproduce these two
observations and from which it is possible to obtain an estimate of the glass
cross-over temperature (typically $T_g \simeq 100 - 200$ mK). The broad
relaxation time spectrum can also be obtained from the solutions of two
microscopic models involving randomly distributed solitons. The collective
behavior is similar to domain growth dynamics in the presence of disorder and
can be described by the dynamical renormalization group that was proposed
recently for the one dimensional random field Ising model [D.S. Fisher, P. Le
Doussal and C. Monthus, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 80}, 3539 (1998)]. The typical
relaxation time scales like $\tau^{\rm typ} \sim \tau_0 \exp{(T_g/T)}$. The
glass cross-over temperature $T_g$ related to correlations among solitons is
equal to the average energy barrier and scales like $T_g \sim 2 x \xi_0
\Delta$. $x$ is the concentration of defects, $\xi_0$ the correlation length of
the CDW or SDW and $\Delta$ the charge or spin gap.

the top production and decay process at linear colliders. The top quarks are
allowed to be off-shell and the production and decay subprocesses are treated
together, thus allowing for interference effects. The framework employed for
our computation is the double pole approximation (DPA). We describe the
implementation of this approximation for the top production and decay process
and compare it with the implementation of DPA for the evaluation of QED
corrections to the W pair production at LEP II. Similarities and differences
between the two cases are pointed out. One result of interest is the incomplete
cancelation of interference corrections. Other results include values for the
total NLO top production cross section, and the impact the nonfactorizable
(interference) corrections have on the top invariant mass distribution.

sufficient conditions so that the reduced phase space of the constrained system

a time-independent metric for which the spacelike formulation of the

positive quadratic forms: the reduction with perfect forms, and the reduction
with L-type domains.
  A form is perfect if can be reconstructed from all representations of its
arithmetic minimum. Two forms have the same L-type if Delaunay tilings of their
lattices are affinely equivalent. Delaunay (1937-38) asked about possible
relative volumes of lattice Delaunay simplexes. We construct an infinite series
of Delaunay simplexes of relative volume n-3, the best known as of now. This
series gives rise to a new infintie series of perfect forms TF_{n} with
interesting properties, e.g. TF_{5}=D_{5}, TF_{6}=E*_{6}, TF_{7}=\phi_{15}^{7}.
For all n the domain of TF_{n} is adjacent to the domain of the 2-nd perfect
form D_{n}. Perfect form TF_{n} is a direct n-dimensional generalization of
Korkine and Zolotareff's 3-rd perfect form \phi_{2}^{5} in 5 variables. It is
likely that this form is equivalent to Anzin's (1991) form h_n.

bias is the phenomenon that `more often' P(x;d,n)>P(x;d,r) than the other way
around, where n is a quadratic non-residue mod d and r is a quadratic residue
mod d. If P(x;d,n)>=P(x;d,r) for every x up to some large number, then one
expects that N(x;d,n)>=N(x;d,r) for every x. Here N(x;d,a) denotes the number
of integers n<=x such that every prime divisor p of n satisfies p=a(mod d).
  In this paper we develop some tools to deal with this type of problem and
apply them to show that, for example, N(x;4,3)>=N(x;4,1) for every x. In the
process we express the so called second order Landau-Ramanujan constant as an
infinite series and show that the same type of formula holds true for a much
larger class of constants.

due to the partial restoration of chiral symmetry. Such soft modes play a key
role to understand the QCD phase structure. We demonstrate that even a slight
softening of the $\sigma$ mode could induce strong spectral enhancement and
strong $\pi$-$\pi$ correlation near the 2$m_{\pi}$ threshold in the $I$=$J$=0
channel, which thereby can be a signature of the partial restoration of chiral
symmetry. Such spectral enhancement may be seen not only in hot matter created
by the relativistic heavy ion collisions but also in cold matter (heavy nuclei)
probed by photons and hadrons. Relevance of the partial restoration of chiral
symmetry in heavy nuclei with the recent data by the CHAOS and CB
collaborations as well as with on-going and future experiments are also
discussed.

wave function and form factors at high momentum transfers. However, in
light-front dynamics rotational invariance is not manifest, which results in a
splitting in the binding energies of states with different magnetic quantum
numbers and a breaking of the angular condition for the matrix elements of the
deuteron current operator. The objective of this work is to investigate the
symptoms of broken rotational invariance.
  We first consider the Wick-Cutkosky model. The binding energies of states
with different m values are split when calculated with the OME potential, but
this splitting is reduced for all states when the TME potential is included.
Next, we derive light-front nucleon-nucleon OME and TME potentials from an
effective nuclear Lagrangian. We consider first the potentials generated by the
exchange of pions only, then the potentials generated by all the mesons. For
both models, there is a splitting in the binding energies between the m=0 and
m=1 deuteron states when the OME potential is used, which is reduced when we
include the TME potential.
  The deuteron wave functions are used to calculate the electromagnetic and
axial current matrix elements and form factors. The matrix elements of the
electromagnetic current operator have better transformation properties under
rotations when we use the OME potential instead of the OME+TME potential to
calculate the wave functions. At momentum transfers greater than about 2 GeV^2,
the breaking of rotational invariance causes less uncertainty in the A and B
form factors than do the uncertainties in the nucleon form factors.

the QLM expansion of both energies and wave functions for all states is very
fast and already the first few iterations yield extremely precise results. The

  Physics Research"" by Nova Science Publ. See also:
  http://www.karelia.ru/~alexk",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  There are unsolved problems in physics leading to difficulties with Maxwell
equations that are not removed by and not directly associated with quantum
mechanics. Recently a number of extended and modified theories have therefore
been put forward. The two theories by the authors (AK and BL) are related to
this state. The first theory consists of a revised formulation of
electromagnetics with an electric vacuum charge density (BL), and the second is
a unified theory of Bivacuum, matter and fields (AK). In the first theory by BL
a space-charge current density arises from the condition of Lorentz invariance,
in addition to the conventional displacement current. The electron charge is
deduced from the theory, and it deviates by only one percent from its
experimental value. Two individual photon models are further investigated.
  In the second theory by AK a Bivacuum model is a consequence of development
of Dirac theory, pointing to equal probability of positive and negative energy.
The dynamic mechanism of [corpuscle (C) - wave (W)] duality is proposed. It
unifies the extended relativity and QM. For details see:
http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0003001. The theories of BL and AK reinforce each
other, by having several points in common. There are the similarities with the
Dirac theory, symmetry with respect to the concepts of matter and antimatter,
the non-appearance of magnetic monopoles, a space- charge vacuum current in
addition to the displacement current, models of the leptons having an internal
vortex-like structure and force balance, photon models with a small but nonzero
rest mass and a slightly reduced velocity of propagation, and particle-wave
properties, explaining self-interference even of single electrons or photons.

reduced by encoding a logical qubit into two qubits, then completely eliminated
by an efficient set of decoupling pulse sequences. The same encoding removes
the need for single-qubit operations, that pose a difficult design constraint.
We further show how the dominant decoherence processes can be identified
empirically, in order to optimize the decoupling pulses.

First, we discuss the peculiarities that may occur if the Hilbert space of a
bi-partite system is infinite-dimensional, most notably the fact that the set
of states with infinite entropy of entanglement is trace-norm dense in state
space, implying that in any neighborhood of every product state there lies an
arbitrarily strongly entangled state. The starting point for a clarification of
this counterintuitive property is the observation that if one imposes the
natural and physically reasonable constraint that the mean energy is bounded
from above, then the entropy of entanglement becomes a trace-norm continuous
functional. The considerations will then be extended to the asymptotic limit,
and we will prove some asymptotic continuity properties. We proceed by
investigating the entanglement of formation and the relative entropy of
entanglement in the infinite-dimensional setting. Finally, we show that the set
of entangled states is still trace-norm dense in state space, even under the
constraint of a finite mean energy.
