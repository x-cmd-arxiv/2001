framework of the FRI/BL Lacs unified scheme, we find that the luminosity
difference between FRI and BL Lac nuclei can be reproduced with a common
beaming factor in both the radio and the optical band, independent of the
extended radio luminosity, thus supporting such a scenario. The corresponding
bulk Lorentz factor is significantly smaller than is expected from
observational and theoretical considerations in BL Lacs: this can be
interpreted as due to a velocity structure in the jet, with a fast spine
surrounded by a slower layer.

dust-scattered sunlight (zodiacal light), and dust-scattered Galactic starlight

airglow, by measuring the absolute surface brightness of the night sky from
above the Earth's atmosphere using the Wide Field Planetary Camera2 (WFPC2) and

On the ground, we have used the duPont 2.5 m Telescope at Las Campanas

from the HST observations. We have minimized the diffuse Galactic light in
advance by selecting the HST target field along a line of sight with low
Galactic dust column density, and then estimated the low--level Galactic
foreground using a simple scattering model and the observed correlation between
thermal, 100 micron emission and optical scattered flux from the same dust. In
this paper, we describe the coordinated LCO/HST program and the HST

type exhibits strong energy-dependent attenuation of X-ray emission at low
energies during a dip, which is characteristic of photoelectric absorption, but
the other type shows nearly energy-independent attenuation. While the first
type of dips are likely caused by density enhancement in an inhomogeneous wind
of the companion star, as previous studies have indicated, the second type
might be due to partial obscuration of an extended X-ray emitting region by
optically thick ``clumps'' in the accretion flow. It is also possible that the
latter are caused by a momentary decrease in the X-ray luminosity of the
source, due, for instance, to a decrease in the mass accretion rate, or by
Thomson scattering in highly ionized ``clumps''. We discuss the implications of

analysing 80 million triangle configurations in the wavenumber range 0.1 < k <
0.5 h/Mpc (i.e. on scales roughly between 5 and 30 Mpc/h) we find that the
linear bias parameter is consistent with unity: b_1=1.04 pm 0.11, and the
quadratic (nonlinear) bias is consistent with zero: b_2=-0.054 pm 0.08. Thus,
at least on large scales, optically-selected galaxies do indeed trace the
underlying mass distribution. The bias parameter can be combined with the
2dFGRS measurement of the redshift distortion parameter beta =
Omega_m^{0.6}/b_1, to yield Omega_m = 0.27 pm 0.06 for the matter density of

marginalization over the matter density parameter Omega_m and three other free
parameters). This normalization is lower than the COBE normalization and
previous estimates from cluster abundance, but it is in agreement with some
revised cluster abundance determinations. We also estimate the
scale-independent bias parameter of present-epoch L_s = 1.9L_* APM-selected
galaxies to be b(L_s,z=0) = 1.10 +- 0.08 on comoving scales of 0.02 < k < 0.15

be almost un-biased, b(L_*,z=0) = 0.96. These results are derived by assuming a

fixing the spectral index n=1 and the optical depth due to reionization tau=0.

and C18O are detected, as well as a prominent band of solid 12CO. The gas phase
12CO lines have red shifted absorption wings (up to 100 km/s), likely
originating from warm disk material falling toward the central object. The
isotopes and the 12CO line wings are successfully fitted with a contracting
disk model of this evolutionary transitional object (Hogerheijde 2001). This
shows that the inward motions seen in millimeter wave emission lines continue
to within ~0.1 AU from the star. The colder parts of the disk are traced by the
prominent CO ice band. The band profile results from CO in 'polar' ices (CO
mixed with H2O), and CO in 'apolar' ices. At the high spectral resolution, the
'apolar' component is, for the first time, resolved into two distinct
components, likely due to pure CO and CO mixed with CO2, O2 and/or N2. The ices
have probably experienced thermal processing in the upper disk layer traced by
our pencil absorption beam: much of the volatile 'apolar' ices has evaporated
and the depletion factor of CO onto grains is remarkably low (~7%). This study
shows that high spectral resolution 4.7 um observations provide important and
unique information on the dynamics and structure of protostellar disks and the

make these objects very unlikely candidates for GRBs. Most candidates for a
GRB/SN connection seem to require the prompt or delayed formation of a black
hole. These include the collapse of very massive stars (e.g. hypernovae) and
'classical' SNe with a significant fallback of material over time scales of
hours to days, resulting in the collapse of the neutron star to a black hole.

emission line image ever to be obtained of a line from the highly excited v=6
level of H2. In both Bars, the H2 emission is generally distributed in clumps
along filamentary features. The 1-0 S(1) and 2-1 S(1) images have similar
morphologies. Together with their relative line ratios, this supports a
fluorescent origin for their emission, within a photodissociation region. The

constant. The 1-0 S(7) line image is also similar to the 1-0 S(1) image, but
the 6-4 O(3) image is significantly different to it. Since the emission
wavelengths of these two lines are similar (1.748 to 1.733um), this cannot be
due to differential extinction between the v=6 and the v=1 lines. We attribute
the difference to the pumping of newly formed H2 into the v=6, or to a nearby,
level. However, this also requires either a time-dependent photodissociation
region (where molecule formation does not balance dissociation), rather than it
to be in steady-state, and/or for the formation spectrum to vary with position
in the source. If this interpretation of formation pumping of molecular

We show that the disappearance of the Rayleigh peak in the fully cut data set

considers theoretical models that could explain the existing data of Cen X-3 in
high and very high energy gamma-rays. On the basis of energetics, all
reasonable options for gamma-ray production must be connected to jets emerging
from the inner accretion disc around the neutron star. One principal option is
a large scale source, with R_s~10^13-14cm, assuming effective acceleration of
electrons by shocks produced by the interaction of the jets with the dense
atmosphere of the binary. The bulk of gamma-ray features could be explained by
this model except modulations at the pulsar period, which would require a
source with R_s<10^11cm. We consider hadronic and leptonic models for the
formation of such a compact object. Both models predict the episodes of pulsed
emission may be rare, of typical duration ~few hours, and the frequency of
pulsations should be significantly shifted from the nominal frequency of the

observed in a variety of astrophysical environments including X-ray binaries,
active galactic nuclei, and possibly gamma-ray bursts. This paper presents
calculations showing how the equivalent width (EW) of the Fe K line depends on
the iron abundance of the illuminated gas and its ionization state -- two
variables subject to significant cosmic scatter. Reflection spectra from a
constant density slab which is illuminated with a power-law spectrum with
photon-index \Gamma are computed using the code of Ross & Fabian. When the Fe K
EW is measured from the reflection spectra alone, we find that it can reach
values greater than 6 keV if the Fe abundance is about 10 times solar and the
illuminated gas is neutral. EWs of about 1 keV are obtained when the gas is
ionized. In contrast, when the EW is measured from the incident+reflected
spectrum, the largest EWs are ~800 keV and are found when the gas is ionized.
When \Gamma is increased, the Fe K line generally weakens, but significant
emission can persist to larger ionization parameters. The iron abundance has
its greatest impact on the EW when it is less than 5 times solar. When the
abundance is further increased, the line strengthens only marginally.
Therefore, we conclude that Fe K lines with EWs much greater than 800 eV are
unlikely to be produced by gas with a supersolar Fe abundance. These results
should be useful in interpreting Fe K emission whenever it arises from
optically thick fluorescence.

determinations of N(DI) based upon GHRS and STIS observations were
controversial due to the saturated strength of the DI Lyman-alpha line. In the
present analysis the column density of DI has been measured using only the
unsaturated Lyman-beta and Lyman-gamma lines observed by FUSE. A careful
inspection of possible systematic uncertainties tied to the modeling of the
stellar continuum or to the uncertainties in the FUSE instrumental
characteristics has been performed. The column densities derived are: log N(DI)

significantly, even though the signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution at

exact results, namely, an expression for the osmotic pressure and a formula for
the ion density at the surface of the macromolecule, known as the contact value
theorem. The next section provides a derivation of the Poisson-Boltzmann
equation from a variational principle and the assumption of a product state.

resonance) microscopy for rendering proton spin density maps. The propagating
proton/deuteron inter-diffusion profiles were recorded and evaluated with
respect to anomalous diffusion parameters. The deviation of the concentration
profiles from those expected for unobstructed diffusion directly reflects the
anomaly of the propagator for diffusion on a percolation cluster. The fractal
dimension of the random walk, $d_w$, evaluated from the diffusion measurements
on the one hand and the fractal dimension, $d_f$, deduced from the spin density
map of the percolation object on the other permits one to experimentally
compare dynamical and static exponents. Approximate calculations of the
propagator are given on the basis of the fractional diffusion equation.
Furthermore, the ordinary diffusion equation was solved numerically for the
corresponding initial and boundary conditions for comparison. The anomalous
diffusion constant was evaluated and is compared to the Brownian case. Some ad

the system. In this way, anomalous solutions of the fractional diffusion

range process in which a particle from an occupied site $k$ hops to its nearest
neighbour with a quenched rate $w(k)$. These rates are chosen randomly from the
probability distribution $f(w) \sim (w-c)^{n}$, where $c$ is the lower cutoff.
For $n > 0$, this model is known to exhibit a phase transition in the steady
state from a low density phase with a finite number of particles at each site
to a high density aggregate phase in which the site with the lowest hopping
rate supports an infinite number of particles. In the latter case, it is
interesting to ask how the system locates the site with globally minimum rate.
We use an argument based on local equilibrium, supported by Monte Carlo
simulations, to describe the approach to the steady state. We find that at
large enough time, the mass transport in the regions with a smooth density
profile is described by a diffusion equation with site-dependent rates, while
the isolated points where the mass distribution is singular act as the
boundaries of these regions. Our argument implies that the relaxation time
scales with the system size $L$ as $L^{z}$ with $z=2+1/(n+1)$ for $n > 1$ and
suggests a different behaviour for $n < 1$.

disturbance needs a sufficiently large critical amplitude to move the flow from

that the size of this amplitude gets translated into a waiting time, i.e.\
until fluctuations sufficiently add up to trigger the transition. A recently
introduced model of traffic flow however does not show this behavior: in the
density regime where the jam solution co-exists with the high-flow state, the
intrinsic stochasticity of the model is not sufficient to cause a transition
into the jammed regime, at least not within relevant time scales. In addition,

with massless quarks in a vacuum free of lattice monopoles. The lattice theory
possesses a second order chiral phase transition which we show is
logarithmically trivial, with the same systematics as the Nambu-Jona Lasinio
model. The irrelevance of the four fermi coupling is established numerically.
The widths of the scaling windows are examined in both the coupling constant
and bare fermion mass directions in parameter space. For vanishing fermion mass
we find a broad scaling window in coupling. By adding a small bare fermion mass
to the action we find that the width of the scaling window in the fermion mass
direction is very narrow. Only when a subdominant scaling term is added to the
leading term of the equation of state are adequate fits to the data possible.
The failure of past studies of lattice QED to produce equation of state fits
with adequate confidence levels to seriously address the question of triviality
is explained. The vacuum state of the lattice model is probed for topological
excitations, such as lattice Monopoles and Dirac strings, and these objects are
shown to be non-critical along the chiral transition line as long as the four
fermi coupling is nonzero.

solar physics investigations. First a 'rates only' analysis is performed whose
best fits appear to be remarkably better than all fits from oscillations. A
global analysis then follows with the corresponding best fits of a comparable
quality to the LMA one. Despite the fact that the resonant spin flavour
precession does not predict any day/night effect, the separate SuperKamiokande
day and night data are included in the analysis in order to allow for a direct

black hole and symmetry restore locally and (b) dynamical wall which is formed
by the balance between the pressure from the Hawking radiation and the pressure
from the wall tensions. The electroweak wall is formed as a thermalized wall
around a black hole with mass of the several hundred kilogram. The GUT wall is
formed as a dynamical wall around much smaller black hole. The electroweak wall
around a black hole can produce baryon number by the assumption of the
CP-broken phase in the wall. The GUT wall can supply charge into the black
hole, namely, the wall causes the spontaneous charging up of the black hole. We
propose a cosmological model which can explain the origin of the baryon number

large compact dimension plays the role of the Planck brane. We investigate the
dynamical stability with respect to graviton, graviphoton and radion modes. The
radion is shown to have a tachyonic instability for certain models of the
4-brane stress-energy, while it is stable in others, and massless in a special
case. If stable, its mass is in the milli-eV range, for parameters of the model
which solve the hierarchy problem. The radion is shown to couple to matter with
gravitational strength, so that it is potentially detectable by
submillimeter-range gravity experiments. The radion mass can be increased using
a bulk scalar field in the manner of Goldberger and Wise, but only to order
MeV, due to the effect of the large extra dimension. The model predicts a
natural scale of 10^{13} GeV on the 4-brane, making it a natural setting for
inflation from the ultraviolet brane.

framework of Schr\""odinger time evolution. Our result consists of showing that
a portion of the wavepacket cannot escape outside a ball whose size grows
dynamically in time, where the rate of this growth is determined by properties
of the spectral measure and by spatial properties of solutions of an associated
time independent Schr\""odinger equation. We also derive a new lower bound on
the spreading rate, which is strongly connected with our upper bound. We apply
these new bounds to the Fibonacci Hamiltonian--the most studied one-dimensional
model of quasicrystals. As a result, we obtain for this model upper and lower
dynamical bounds establishing wavepacket spreading rates which are intermediate
between ballistic transport and localization. The bounds have the same
qualitative behavior in the limit of large coupling.

measurements with continuous variable outcomes is presented to establish
criteria for the demonstration of the EPR paradox, for situations where the
correlation between spatially separated subsystems is not perfect. Two types of
criteria for EPR correlations are determined. The first type are based on
measurements of the variances of conditional probability distributions and are
necessary to reflect directly the situation of the original EPR paradox. The
second weaker set of EPR criteria are based on the proven failure of
(Bell-type) local realistic theories which could be consistent with a local
quantum description for each subsystem. The relationship with criteria
sufficient to prove entanglement is established, to show that any demonstration
of EPR correlations will also signify entanglement. It is also shown how a
demonstration of entanglement between two spatially separated subsystems, if
not able to interpreted as a violation of a Bell-type inequality, may be
interpreted as a demonstration of the EPR correlations. In particular it is
explained how the experimental observation of two-mode squeezing using
spatially separated detectors will signify not only entanglement but EPR
correlations defined in a general sense.

sufficient to demonstrate the existence of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)

shown how such EPR criteria, which do not demand perfect EPR correlations, can
be used to prove the extent of security for continuous variable quantum
cryptographic schemes (in analogy to that proposed by Ekert) where Alice and
Bob hope to construct a secure sequence of values from measurements performed
on continuous-variable EPR-correlated fields sent from a distant source. It is
proven that the demonstration of the EPR criterion on Alice's and Bob's joint
statistics compels a necessary loss in the ability to infer the results shared
by Alice and Bob, by measurements performed on any third channel potentially
representing an eavesdropper (Eve). This result makes no assumption about the
nature of the quantum source of the fields transmitted to Alice and Bob, except
that the EPR correlations are observed at the final detector locations. In this
way a means is provided to establish security in the presence of some loss and
less than optimal correlation, and against any eavesdropping strategy employed
by Eve prior to detection of the fields by Alice and Bob.
