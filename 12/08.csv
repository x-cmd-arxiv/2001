the integrated extragalactic background light (EBL) at optical wavelengths. We
have also computed the integrated light from individual galaxy counts in the
images used to measure the EBL and in the Hubble Deep Field. We find that the
flux in galaxies as measured by standard galaxy photometry methods has
generally been underestimated by about 50%. Further, we find that the total
flux in individually detected galaxies is a factor of 2 to 3 less than the EBL
at 3000--8000A. We show that a significant fraction of the EBL may come from
normal galaxies at z<4, which are simply undetectable as a result of
K-corrections and cosmological surface brightness dimming. This is consistent
with recent redshift surveys at z<4. In the context of some simple models, we
discuss the constraints placed by the EBL on the evolution of the luminosity
density at z>1. Based on our optical EBL and published UV and IR EBL
measurements, we estimate that the total EBL from 0.1--1000 microns is 100+/-20
nW/m^2/sr. If the total EBL were produced entirely by stellar nucleosynthesis,
then we estimate that the total baryonic mass processed through stars is
Omega_* = 0.0062 (+/- 0.0022) h^{-2}, which corresponds to 0.33+/-0.12 Omega_B
for currently favored values of the baryon density. This estimate is smaller by
roughly 7% if 7 h_{0.7} nW/m^2/sr of the total EBL comes from accretion onto
central black holes. This estimate of Omega_* suggests that the universe has
been enriched to a total metal mass of 0.21(+/-0.13) Z_sun Omega_B. Our
estimate is consistent with other measurements of the cumulative metal mass
fraction of stars, stellar remnants, and the intracluster medium of galaxy
clusters in the local universe.

methods; a method of our own design using a modified version of the SExtractor
algorithm, and a wavelet transform technique developed specifically for Chandra
observations. The detection threshold has been set in order to have less than
10 spurious sources, as assessed by extensive simulations. We subdivided the
catalog into four sections. The primary list consists of objects common to the
two detection methods. Two secondary lists contain sources which were detected
by: 1) the SExtractor algorithm alone and 2) the wavelet technique alone. The
fourth list consists of possible diffuse or extended sources. The flux limits
at the aimpoint for the soft (0.5--2 keV) and hard (2--10 keV) bands are
5.5E-17 erg/s/cm^2 and 4.5E-16 erg/s/cm^2 respectively. The total number of
sources is 346; out of them, 307 were detected in the 0.5--2 keV band, and 251
in the 2--10 keV band.
  We also present optical identifications for the catalogued sources. Our
primary optical data is R band imaging to a depth of R~26.5 (Vega). We found
that the R-band/Chandra offsets are small, ~1 arcsec. Coordinate
cross-correlation finds 85% of the Chandra sources covered in R to have
counterparts within the 3-sigma error box (>~1.5 arcsec depending on off-axis
angle and signal-to-noise). The unidentified fraction of sources, approximately
~10--15 %, is close to the limit expected from the observed X-ray flux to

mostly based on solving the Jeans equations or on finding the distribution
function directly from the density, which often places restrictions on the
shape of the galaxy. Here, no assumptions are made and any axisymmetric density
distribution is possible. The observables are calculated (semi-)analytically,
so that our method is faster than most previous, fully numerical
implementations. Various aspects are tested extensively, the results of which
apply directly to three-integral Schwarzschild methods. We show that a given
distribution function can be reproduced with high accuracy and investigate the
behaviour of the parameter that is used to measure the goodness-of-fit.
Furthermore, we show that the method correctly identifies the range of cusp
clopes for which axisymmetric two-integral models with a central black hole do
not exist.

of [CI] to 13CO increases with the central [CI] luminosity of a galaxy; it is
lowest for quiescent and mild starburst centers, and highest for strong

calculations shows that most observed galaxy centers have neutral carbon
abundances close to, or exceeding, carbon monoxide abundances, rather
independent from the assumed model gas parameters. The same models suggest that
the emission from neutral carbon and carbon monoxide, if assumed to originate

in the frequency range 400 Hz to 2500 Hz using the burst records for 2203 GRBs
and 152 SGR flares. The study employs the Rayleigh power as a test statistic to
evaluate the evidence for periodic emissions. We find no evidence of periodic
emissions from these events at these frequencies. In all but a very few cases
the maximum power values obtained are consistent with what would be expected by
chance from a non-periodic signal. In those few instances where there is
marginal evidence for periodicity there are problems with the data that cast
doubt on the reality of the signal. For classical GRBs, the largest Rayleigh
power occurs in bursts whose TTE data appear to be corrupted. For SGRs, our
largest Rayleigh power, with a significance of 1%, occurs in one record for SGR
1900+14 (at 2497 Hz), and in no other outbursts associated with this source; we
thus consider it unlikely to represent detection of a real periodicity. From
simulations, we deduce that the Rayleigh test would have detected significant
oscillations with relative amplitude ~10% about half the time. Thus, we
conclude that high frequency oscillations, if present, must have small relative
amplitudes.

This measurement and contemporaneous Hubble Space Telescope data from WFPC2 and
FOS comprise a coordinated program to measure the mean flux of the diffuse
extragalactic background light (EBL). The zodiacal light at optical wavelengths
results from scattering by interplanetary dust, so that the zodiacal light flux
toward any extragalactic target varies seasonally with the position of the
Earth. This measurement of zodiacal light is therefore relevant to the specific
observations (date and target field) under discussion. To obtain this result,
we have developed a technique that uses the strength of the zodiacal Fraunhofer
lines to identify the absolute flux of the zodiacal light in the
multiple-component night sky spectrum. Statistical uncertainties in the result
are 0.6% (1 sigma). However, the dominant source of uncertainty is systematic
errors, which we estimate to be 1.1% (1 sigma). We discuss the contributions
included in this estimate explicitly. The systematic errors in this result
contribute 25% in quadrature to the final error in our coordinated EBL
measurement, which is presented in the first paper of this series.

Star-to-star stochastic variations with significant range in both [C/Fe] and
[N/Fe] are found at all luminosities extending to the bottom of the RGB at M_V
\sim +3. Similar variations in CH appear to be present in the main sequence
turnoff spectra. There is no sign of a change in the behavior of C and N with
evolutionary stage over the full range in luminosity of the RGB and SGB. The C
and N abundances appear strongly anti-correlated, as would be expected from the
CN-cycle processing of stellar material. Yet the present stars are considerably
fainter than the RGB bump, the point at which deep mixing is believed to set
in. On this basis, while the observed abundance pattern is consistent with
proton capture nucleosynthesis, we infer that the site of the reactions is
likely not within the present sample, but rather in a population of more
massive (2 -- 5 M(Sun)) now defunct stars. The range of variation of the N
abundances is very large and the sum of C+N increases as C decreases. To
reproduce this requires the incorporation not only of CN but also of
ON-processed material. Furthermore, the existence of this correlation is quite
difficult to reproduce with an external mechanism such as ``pollution'' with
material processed in a more massive AGB star, which mechanism is fundamentally
stochastic in nature. We therefore suggest that although the internal mixing
hypothesis has serious flaws,new theoretical insights are needed and it should
not be ruled out yet. (abridged)

inclusion of these effects in the context of an open system exchanging particle
and energy with the external environment. This calls for combining the theory
of quantum transport with the theory of electronic structure starting from the
first-principles. We present a rigorous yet tractable matrix Green's function
approach for studying transport in molecular electronic devices, based on the
Non-Equilibrium Green's Function Formalism of quantum transport and the
density-functional theory of electronic structure using local orbital basis
sets. By separating the device rigorously into the molecular region and the
contact region, we can take full advantage of the natural spatial locality
associated with the metallic screening in the electrodes and focus on the
physical processes in the finite molecular region. This not only opens up the
possibility of using the existing well-established technique of molecular
electronic structure theory in transport calculations with little change, but
also allows us to use the language of qualitative molecular orbital theory to
interpret and rationalize the results of the computation. For the device at
equilibrium, our method provides an alternative approach for solving the
molecular chemisorption problem. For the device out of equilibrium, we show
that the calculation of elastic current transport through molecules, both

states (called synchronized traffic) stimulated by Kerner's hypotheses about
the existence of a multitude of metastable states in the fundamental diagram.
Using single vehicle data collected at the German highway A1, temporal velocity
patterns have been analyzed to show a collection of certain fragments with
approximately constant velocities and sharp jumps between them. The particular
velocity values in these fragments vary in a wide range. In contrast, the flow
rate is more or less constant because its fluctuations are mainly due to the
discreteness of traffic flow.
  Subsequently, we develop a model for synchronized traffic that can explain
these characteristics. Following previous work (I.A.Lubashevsky, R.Mahnke,
Phys. Rev. E v. 62, p. 6082, 2000) the vehicle flow is specified by car
density, mean velocity, and additional order parameters $h$ and $a$ that are
due to the many-particle effects of the vehicle interaction. The parameter $h$
describes the multilane correlations in the vehicle motion. Together with the
car density it determines directly the mean velocity. The parameter $a$, in
contrast, controls the evolution of $h$ only. The model assumes that $a$
fluctuates randomly around the value corresponding to the car configuration
optimal for lane changing. When it deviates from this value the lane change is
depressed for all cars forming a local cluster. Since exactly the overtaking
manoeuvres of these cars cause the order parameter $a$ to vary, the evolution
of the car arrangement becomes frozen for a certain time. In other words, the
evolution equations form certain dynamical traps responsible for the long-time
correlations in the synchronized mode.

introduce a statistic which generalizes the excess power statistic proposed by
Flanagan and Hughes and extended by Anderson et al. The statistic we propose is
shown to be optimal for arbitrary noise spectral characteristic, under the two
hypotheses that the noise is Gaussian, and that the prior for the signal is
uniform. The statistic derivation is based on the assumption that a signal
affects only affects N samples in the data stream, but that no other
information is a priori available, and that the value of the signal at each
sample can be arbitrary. We show that the proposed statistic can be implemented
combining standard time-series analysis tools which can be efficiently
implemented, and the resulting computational cost is still compatible with an
on-line analysis of interferometric data. We generalize this version of an
excess power statistic to the multiple detector case, also including the effect
of correlated noise. We give full details about the implementation of the
algorithm, both for the single and the multiple detector case, and we discuss
exact and approximate forms, depending on the specific characteristics of the
noise and on the assumed length of the burst event. As a example, we show what
would be the sensitivity of the network of interferometers to a delta-function

experiments, which can lead to as much as an eight-fold degeneracy in the
determination of the oscillation parameters. We discuss the implications these
degeneracies have for detecting CP violation and present criteria for breaking
them. A superbeam facility with a baseline at least as long as the distance
between Fermilab and Homestake (1290 km) and a narrow band beam with energy
tuned so that the measurements are performed at the first oscillation peak can
resolve all the ambiguities other than the (\theta_{23}, \pi/2-\theta_{23})
ambiguity (which can be resolved at a neutrino factory) and a residual (\delta,
\pi-\delta) ambiguity. However, whether or not CP violation occurs in the
neutrino sector can be ascertained independently of the latter two ambiguities.
The (\delta,\pi-\delta) ambiguity can be eliminated by performing a second
measurement to which only the \cos\delta terms contribute. The hierarchy of
mass eigenstates can be determined at other oscillation peaks only in the most
optimistic conditions, making it necessary to use the first oscillation
maximum. We show that the degeneracies may severely compromise the ability of
the proposed SuperJHF-HyperKamiokande experiment to establish CP violation. In
our calculations we use approximate analytic expressions for oscillation
probabilitites that agree with numerical solutions with a realistic Earth

the diagonal form of the Dirac neutrino mass matrix and the non-diagonal
texture of the right-handed Majorana mass matrix. In a model independent way,
we construct a specific form of the charged lepton mass matrix having a special
structure in 1-2 block, which contribution to the leptonic mixing (MNS) matrix
leads to the predictions $\sin^{2}2\theta_{12}=0.8517$,
$\sin^{2}2\theta_{23}=0.9494$, and $|V_{e3}|=0.159$ at the unification scale.
These predictions are found to be consistent with the LMA MSW solution of the

stable against the quantum radiative corrections in the MSSM. A numerical
analysis of the renormalisation group equations (RGEs) in the MSSM shows a mild
decrease of the mixing angles with the decrease of energy scale and the

that there is a common thread to many generalizations of Dedekind sums, namely
through the study of lattice point enumeration of rational polytopes. In
particular, there are some natural finite Fourier series which we call
Fourier-Dedekind sums, and which form the building blocks of the number of
partitions of an integer from a finite set of positive integers. This problem
also goes by the name of the `coin exchange problem'. Dedekind sums have
enjoyed a resurgence of interest recently, from such diverse fields as
topology, number theory, and combinatorial geometry. The Fourier-Dedekind sums
we study here include as special cases generalized Dedekind sums studied by
Berndt, Carlitz, Grosswald, Knuth, Rademacher, and Zagier. Our interest in
these sums stems from the appearance of Dedekind's and Zagier's sums in lattice
point count formulas for polytopes. Using some simple generating functions, we
show that generalized Dedekind sums are natural ingredients for such formulas.
As immediate `geometric' corollaries to our formulas, we obtain and generalize

oscillation reduction (CFOR) scheme for the simulation of fluid flows. The
Hermite kernel is constructed by using the discrete singular convolution (DSC)
algorithm, which provides a systematic generation of low-pass filter and its
conjugate high-pass filters. The high-pass filters are utilized for
approximating spatial derivatives in solving flow equations, while the
conjugate low-pass filter is activated to eliminate spurious oscillations
accumulated during the time evolution of a flow. As both low-pass and high-pass
filters are derived from the Hermite kernel, they have similar regularity,
time-frequency localization, effective frequency band and compact support.
Fourier analysis indicates that the CFOR-Hermite scheme yields a nearly optimal
resolution and has a better approximation to the ideal low-pass filter than
previously CFOR schemes. Thus, it has better potential for resolving natural
high frequency oscillations from a shock. Extensive one- and two-dimensional
numerical examples, including both incompressible and compressible flows, with
or without shocks, are employed to explore the utility, test the resolution,
and examine the stability of the present CFOR-Hermite scheme. Extremely small
ratio of point-per-wavelength (PPW) is achieved in solving the Taylor problem,
advancing a wavepacket and resolving a shock/entropy wave interaction. The
present results for the advection of an isentropic vortex compare very
favorably to those in the literature.

is a maximum for the parameter values corresponding roughly to a bifurcation of
a fixed point in the corresponding semiclassical dynamics. We conjecture that

suppressing decoherence between distinct decoherence free subspaces in quantum
registers. The effect is found in the framework of exact coherent-product
solutions for model registers decohering in a bath of degenerate harmonic
modes, through couplings linear in bath coordinates. These solutions represent
a natural nonequilibrium extension of the standard solution for a decoupled
initial register state and a thermal environment. Under appropriate conditions,
the corresponding reduced register distribution can propagate in an unperturbed
manner, even in the presence of entanglement between states belonging to
distinct decoherence free subspaces, and despite persistent bath entanglement.
As a byproduct, we also obtain a refined picture of coherence dynamics under
bang-bang decoherence control. In particular, it is shown that each
radio-frequency pulse in a typical bang-bang cycle induces a revival of
coherence, and that these revivals are exploited in a natural way by the
time-symmetrized version of the bang-bang protocol.

time evolution along the direction of steepest entropy ascent unfolds at the
fastest rate compatible with the time-energy Heisenberg uncertainty relation.
This ansatz provides a possible well-behaved general closure of the nonlinear
