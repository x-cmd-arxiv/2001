for 76 star clusters in the nuclear star-forming ring of the barred spiral
galaxy NGC 4314. These clusters are likely associated with an inner Inner
Lindblad Resonance, or IILR. The blue colors and H-alpha emission for most of
these clusters imply very young ages of 1-15 Myr. Age estimates based on
several reddening-free parameters indicate that the present epoch of star
formation has lasted at least 30 Myr. By estimating the masses of stars in the
clusters and comparing with the H-alpha luminosity, we conclude that a
significant fraction of ongoing star formation in the nuclear ring of NGC 4314
occurs in clusters. The cluster masses identify these as young open clusters,
not young globular clusters. Further out in the galaxy, just exterior to the
ring of young stars, previous ground-based observations revealed two symmetric
stellar spiral arms which may be associated with an outer Inner Lindblad
Resonance, or OILR. With our HST data, we have revealed part of this structure
and its colors in more detail. The spiral arm colors are consistent with
stellar ages between 40 and 200 Myr. The age difference between the inner ring
of young stars (IILR) and the larger oval-like feature containing the blue arms
(OILR) supports an interpretation of the morphology of the nuclear region of
NGC 4314 that requires a reservoir of gas that becomes more compact over time.
We speculate that as the gas distribution becomes more centrally concentrated,
it interacts with these two resonances. Each resonance triggers star formation,
resulting in two distinct epochs of star formation.

all cases investigated so far, chaotic orbits result from overlapping
resonances. Perhaps the clearest examples are found in the asteroid belt.
Overlapping resonances account for its Kirkwood gaps and were used to predict
and find evidence for very narrow gaps in the outer belt. Further afield, about
one new ``short-period'' comet is discovered each year. They are believed to
come from the ``Kuiper Belt'' (at 40 AU or more) via chaotic orbits produced by
mean-motion and secular resonances with Neptune. Finally, the planetary system
itself is not immune from chaos. In the inner solar system, overlapping secular
resonances have been identified as the possible source of chaos. For example,
Mercury, in 10^{12} years, may suffer a close encounter with Venus or plunge
into the Sun. In the outer solar system, three-body resonances have been
identified as a source of chaos, but on an even longer time scale of 10^9 times
the age of the solar system. On the human time scale, the planets do follow
their orbits in a stately procession, and we can predict their trajectories for
hundreds of thousands of years. That is because the mavericks, with shorter
instability times, have long since been ejected. The solar system is not
stable; it is just old!

of inward migration within an evolving protoplanetary disc. Brown dwarf
secondaries forming at the same time as the primary star have masses which are
comparable to the initial mass of the protoplanetary disc. Subsequent disc
evolution leads to inward migration, and destruction of the brown dwarf, via
merger with the star. This is in contrast with massive planets, which avoid
this fate by forming at a later epoch when the disc is close to being
dispersed. Within this model, a brown dwarf desert arises because the mass at
the hydrogen burning limit is coincidentally comparable to the initial disc
mass for a Solar mass star. Brown dwarfs should be found in close binaries
around very low mass stars, around other brown dwarfs, and around Solar-type

X-ray sources in the region surrounding the Hubble Deep Field North (HDF-N),
yielding the most sensitive probe of extended X-ray emission at cosmological
distances to date. A total of six such sources are detected, the majority of
which align with small numbers of optically bright galaxies. Their angular
sizes, band ratios, and X-ray luminosities -- assuming they lie at the same
distances as the galaxies coincident with the X-ray emission -- are generally
consistent with the properties found for nearby groups of galaxies. One source
is notably different and is likely to be a poor-to-moderate X-ray cluster at
high redshift (i.e., z > 0.7). We are also able to place strong constraints on
the optically detected cluster of galaxies ClG 1236+6215 at z=0.85 and the
wide-angle-tail radio galaxy VLA J123725.7+621128 at z~1-2. With rest-frame
0.5--2.0 keV X-ray luminosities of <(3-15)e42 ergs s^{-1}, the environments of
both sources are either likely to have a significant deficit of hot
intra-cluster gas compared to local clusters of galaxies, or they are X-ray
groups. We find the surface density of extended X-ray sources in this
observation to be 167 (+97,-67) deg^{-2} at a limiting soft-band flux of
approximately 3e-16 ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2}. No evolution in the X-ray luminosity
function of clusters is needed to explain this value. (Abridged)

Galactic Center, is caused by a young, very fast pulsar in the high density
medium. The pulsar accelerates iron nuclei to energies $\sim 10^{20}$ eV, as
postulated by the Galactic models for the origin of the highest energy cosmic
rays. The iron nuclei, after about 1 yr since pulsar formation, leave the
supernova envelope without energy losses and diffuse through the dense central
region of the Galaxy. Some of them collide with the background matter creating
neutrons (from desintegration of Fe), neutrinos and gamma-rays (in inelastic
collisions). Wse suggest that neutrons produced at a specific time after the
pulsar formation are responsible for the observed excess of cosmic rays at
$\sim 10^{18}$ eV. From normalization of the calculated neutron flux to the one
observed in the cosmic ray excess, we predict the neutrino and gamma-ray
fluxes. It has been found that the 1 km$^2$ neutrino detector of the IceCube
type should detect from a few up to several events per year from the Galactic
Center, depending on the parameters of the considered model. Also future
systems of Cherenkov telescopes (CANGAROO III, HESS, VERITAS) should be able to
observe 1 - 10 TeV $\gamma$-rays from the Galactic Center if the pulsar was
created inside a huge molecular cloud about $3-10\times 10^3$ yrs ago.

Aharonov-Bohm effects: the quantum interference between different electron
closed paths where each one of them encloses a net magnetic flux. Specifically,
we compute exactly the sums of magnetic phase factors, i.e., the lattice path
integrals, on all closed lattice paths of different lengths. A very large
number, e.g., up to $10^{81}$ for the square lattice, exact lattice path
integrals are obtained. Analytic results of these lattice path integrals then
enable us to obtain the resistive transition temperature as a continuous
function of the field. In particular, we can analyze measurable effects on the
superconducting transition temperature, $T_c(B)$, as a function of the magnetic
filed $B$, originating from electron trajectories over loops of various
lengths. In addition to systematically deriving previously observed features,
and understanding the physical origin of the dips in $T_c(B)$ as a result of
multiple-loop quantum interference effects, we also find novel results. In
particular, we explicitly derive the self-similarity in the phase diagram of
square networks. Our approach allows us to analyze the complex structure

performed through the introduction of non-local ladder operators. By exploiting
the hidden symmetry of the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator the eigenvalues
for the angular momentum operators in three dimensions are reproduced.
  A generalization for N-dimensions is performed for both Coulomb and harmonic
oscillator problems in angular deficit space-times.
  It is thus established the connection among the states and energies of both
problems in these topologically non-trivial space-times.

like a holomorphic function of x+iy.
  The first paper math.DG/0111324 studied the case when a is nonzero. Then u,v
are smooth and N is nonsingular. It proved existence and uniqueness for
solutions of two Dirichlet problems derived from the equations on u,v. This
implied existence and uniqueness for a large class of nonsingular
U(1)-invariant SL 3-folds in C^3, with boundary conditions.
  In this paper and its sequel math.DG/0204343 we focus on the case a=0. Then
the nonlinear Cauchy-Riemann equation is not always elliptic. Because of this
there may be points (x,0) where u,v are not differentiable, corresponding to
singular points of N. This paper is concerned largely with technical analytic
issues, and the sequel with the geometry of the singularities of N.
  We prove a priori estimates for derivatives of solutions of the nonlinear
Cauchy-Riemann equation, and use them to show existence and uniqueness of weak
solutions u,v to the two Dirichlet problems when a=0, which are continuous and
weakly differentiable. This gives existence and uniqueness for a large class of
singular U(1)-invariant SL 3-folds in C^3, with boundary conditions.

space by a finite group.'' This sentence is so easily said or written that more
than one person has missed some of the subtleties hidden by orbifolds.
Orbifolds were first introduced by Satake under the name ``V-manifold'' and
rediscovered by Thurston who called them ``orbifolds''. Both of them used only
faithful actions to define their orbifolds (these are the so called reduced
orbifolds). This intuitive restriction is very unnatural mathematically if we
want for example to study suborbifolds. Orbispaces are to topological spaces
what orbifolds are to manifolds. They have been defined by Haefliger via
topological groupoids. He defined the homotopy and (co)homology groups of an
orbispace to be those of the classifying space of the topological groupoid.
However, his definition of morphisms is complicated and technical. Ruan and
Chen have tried to reformulate the definitions, but they don't seem treat the
non-reduced case in a satisfactory way. Our idea is to define orbispaces and
orbifolds directly via their classifying spaces. This approach allows us to
easily define morphisms of orbispaces and orbifolds with all the desired good
properties.

the difference in mechanisms of the bulk and surface conductivity as indicated

(10-100 A) oxide layer on the surface of CZT, formed during the fabrication
process, affects both bulk and surface leakage currents. We demonstrate that
the measured I-V dependencies of bulk current can be explained by considering
the CZT detector as a metal-semiconductor-metal system with two back-to-back
Schottky-barrier contacts. The high surface leakage current is apparently due
to the presence of a low-resistivity surface layer that has characteristics
which differ considerably from those of the bulk material. This surface layer
has a profound effect on the charge collection efficiency in detectors with
multi-contact geometry; some fraction of the electric field lines originated on
the cathode intersects the surface areas between the pixel contacts where the
charge produced by an ionizing particle gets trapped. To overcome this effect
we place a grid of thin electrodes between the pixel contacts; when the grid is
negatively biased, the strong electric field in the gaps between the pixels
forces the electrons landing on the surface to move toward the contacts,
preventing the charge loss. We have investigated these effects by using CZT
pixel detectors indium bump bonded to a custom-built VLSI readout chip.
