For comparison, we have recalculated the galactic orbits of stars from the

that stars with planets are not kinematically peculiar. At each perigalactic
distance stars with planets have a metallicity systematically larger than the
average for the comparison sample. We argue that this result favors scenarios
where the presence of planets is the cause of the higher metallicity of stars

for the planar n-body problem. Jacobi coordinates are used to reduce the
two-dimensional n-body problem to an (n-1)-body problem that incorporates the

quantum theory for a 'quantum equilibrium' distribution of hidden variables,
must predict the existence of instantaneous signals at the statistical level
for hypothetical 'nonequilibrium ensembles'. This 'signal-locality theorem'
generalises yet another feature of the pilot-wave theory of de Broglie and
Bohm, for which it is already known that signal-locality is true only in
equilibrium. Assuming certain symmetries, lower bounds are derived on the
'degree of nonlocality' of the singlet state, defined as the (equilibrium)
fraction of outcomes at one wing of an EPR-experiment that change in response
to a shift in the distant angular setting. It is shown by explicit calculation
that these bounds are satisfied by pilot-wave theory. The degree of nonlocality
is interpreted as the average number of bits of 'subquantum information'
transmitted superluminally, for an equilibrium ensemble. It is proposed that
this quantity might provide a novel measure of the entanglement of a quantum
state, and that the field of quantum information would benefit from a more
explicit hidden-variables approach. It is argued that the signal-locality
theorem supports the hypothesis, made elsewhere, that in the remote past the
universe relaxed to a state of statistical equilibrium at the hidden-variable
level, a state in which nonlocality happens to be masked by quantum noise.
