disc galaxies, inner haloes may stimulate it. This constitutes a new
instability mechanism by which bars can grow. To show this I use a number of
N-body simulations whose initial conditions have identical discs and more or
less concentrated haloes. They show that the bar that grows in the more
halo-dominated environment is considerably stronger than the bar that grows in
the more disc-dominated environment. This result is obtained from simulations
with live haloes, i.e. composed of particles which respond to the disc and take
part in the evolution. On the other hand, if the halo is rigid, it hinders or
quenches bar formation, as expected. Comparison of two simulations which are
identical in everything, except that the halo is live in the first one and
rigid in the second one, leads me to suggest that the halo response can help
the bar grow. Following the orbits of the stars in the halo, I find that a
considerable fraction of the halo particles are in resonance with the bar. The
halo may thus take angular momentum from the bar and stimulate its growth. I
finally discuss whether and how the results of the N-body simulations can be
applied to real galaxies.

  II. Basic Building Blocks"", ed. M. Sauvage et al",,"10.1023/A:1019567815925",,"astro-ph",,"  Most formation scenarios of globular clusters assume a molecular cloud as the
progenitor of the stellar system. However, it is still unclear, how this cloud
is transformed into a star cluster, i.e. how the destructive processes related
to gas removal or low star formation efficiency can be avoided. Here a scheme
of supernova (SN) induced cluster formation is studied. According to this
scenario an expanding SN shell accumulates the mass of the cloud. This is
accompanied by fragmentation resulting in star formation in the shell. Provided
the stellar shell expands sufficiently slow, its self-gravity stops the
expansion and the shell recollapses, by this forming a stellar system.
  I present N-body simulations of collapsing shells which move in a galactic
potential on circular and elliptic orbits. It is shown that typical shells
(10^5 Msun, 30 pc) evolve to twin clusters over a large range of galactocentric
distances. Outside this range single stellar systems are formed, whereas at
small galactocentric distances the shells are tidally disrupted. In that case
many small fragments formed during the collapse survive as single bound
entities. About 1/3 of the twin cluster systems formed on circular orbits merge
within 400 Myr. On elliptic orbits the merger rate reduces to less than 4%.
Thus, there could be a significant number of twin clusters even in our Galaxy,
which, however, might be undetected as twins due to a large phase shift on
their common orbit.

world model goes from contracting to expanding phases through smooth and
non-singular bouncing phases. As long as the gravity dominates over the

In the spherical geometry with a pressureless medium, we show that there exists
a special gauge-invariant combination \Phi which stays constant throughout the
evolution from the big-bang to the big-crunch with the same value even after
the bounce: it characterizes the coefficient of the C-mode. We show this result
by using a bounce model where the pressure gradient term is negligible during
the bounce; this requires additional presence of an exotic matter. In such a
bounce, even in more general situations of the equation of states before and
after the bounce, the C-mode in the expanding phase is affected only by the
C-mode in the contracting phase, thus the growing mode in the contracting phase
decays away as the world model enters expanding phase. In the case the
background curvature has significant role during the bounce, the pressure
gradient term becomes important and we cannot trace C-mode in the expanding
phase to the one before the bounce. In such situations, perturbations in a
fluid bounce model show exponential instability, whereas the ones in a scalar

complete line-of-sight velocity distributions of stars along the galaxies'
major axes. From these data, we have derived both model distribution functions
(the phase density of their stars) and the approximate form of their
gravitational potentials. The derived distribution functions are all consistent
with these galaxies being simple disc systems, with no evidence for a complex
formation history. Essentially no correlation is found between the
characteristic mass scale-lengths and the photometric scale-lengths in these
galaxies, suggesting that they are dark-matter dominated even in their inner
parts. Similarly, no correlation is found between the mass scale-lengths and
asymptotic rotation speed, implying a wide range of dark matter halo
properties. By comparing their asymptotic rotation speeds with their absolute
magnitudes, we find that these S0 galaxies are systematically offset from the
Tully-Fisher relation for later-type galaxies. The offset in luminosity is what
one would expect if star formation had been suddenly switched off a few Gyrs
ago, consistent with a simple picture in which these S0s were created from
ordinary later-type spirals which were stripped of their star-forming ISM when

Such bubbles could naturally account for the high fraction of the internal
energy residing in relativistic electrons/positrons ($\epsilon_e$) and the high
magnetic-to-internal energy ratio ($\epsilon_B$) that have been inferred in a
number of sources. GRBs might occur within PWBs under a number of scenarios: in
particular, in the supranova model of GRB formation a prolonged (months to
years) period of intense pulsar-type wind from the GRB progenitor precedes the
burst. Focusing on this scenario, we construct a simple model of the early-time
structure of a plerionic supernova remnant. The model is based on the
assumption of an ``equipartition'' upper bound on the electromagnetic-
to-thermal pressure ratio in the bubble and takes into account synchrotron-
radiation cooling. We derive an expression for the effective hydrogen number
density $n_{H,equiv}$ of the shocked pulsar wind in terms of the comoving
particle pressure and electromagnetic fields. We show that, for plausible
parameter values, $n_{H,equiv}$ spans the range inferred from spectral fits to
GRB afterglows and that its radial profile varies within the bubble and may
resemble a uniform interstellar medium or a stellar wind. We consider how the
standard expressions for the characteristic synchrotron spectrum are modified
when the afterglow-emitting shock propagates inside a PWB and demonstrate that
the predictions for the empirically inferred values of $\epsilon_e$ and
$\epsilon_B$ are compatible with the observations. Finally, we outline a
self-consistent interpretation of the X-ray emission features detected in

hydrodynamical simulation of the formation of one of the first stars in the

gravitational instability from small initidal density perturbations. As they
assemble via hierarchical merging, primordial gas cools through ro-vibrational
lines of hydrogen molecules and sinks to the center of the dark matter
potential well. The high redshift analog of a molecular cloud is formed. When
the dense, central parts of the cold gas cloud become self-gravitating, a dense
core of approximately 100 solar mass undergoes rapid contraction. At densities
n>10^9 cm^-3 a one solar mass proto-stellar core becomes fully molecular due to
three-body H_2 formation. Contrary to analytical expectations this process does
not lead to renewed fragmentation and only one star is formed. The calculation
is stopped when optical depth effects become important, leaving the final mass
of the fully formed star somewhat uncertain. At this stage the protostar is
acreting material very rapidly (~0.01 solar masses per year). Radiative
feedback from the star will not only halt its growth but also inhibit the
formation of other stars in the same pre-galactic object (at least until the
first star ends its life, presumably as a supernova). We conclude that at most
one massive (M >> 1 solar mass) metal free star forms per pre-galactic halo,
consistent with recent abundance measurements of metal poor galactic halo
stars.

explored by means of analytic treatment and Monte Carlo simulations. We argue
that the main mechanism responsible for the circular polarization properties of

contrary to common expectation, a significant rate of Faraday rotation does not
necessarily imply strong depolarization. The long-term persistence of the sign
of circular polarization, observed in many sources, is most likely due to a
small net magnetic flux generated in the central engine, carried along the jet
axis and superimposed on a highly turbulent magnetic field. We show that the
mean levels of circular and linear polarizations depend on the number of field
reversals along the line of sight and that the gradient in Faraday rotation
across turbulent regions can lead to ``correlation depolarization''. Our model
is potentially applicable to a wide range of synchrotron sources. In
particular, we demonstrate how our model can naturally explain the excess of
circular over linear polarization in the Galactic Center and the nearby spiral

and observed to be blueshifted by 300-800 km/s with respect to the centroid of
Ly-alpha emission. A correlation is found between this blueshift and the
equivalent width of the metal lines, which we interpret as a broadening of
saturated absorption lines caused by a dispersion in the outflow velocity of
interstellar gas. Local starburst galaxies show similar behavior, associated
with obvious gas outflows. We also find a trend of increasing equivalent width
of Ly-alpha emission with redshift, which may be a genuine evolutionary effect
towards younger stellar populations at high redshift with less developed
stellar continua. No obvious emission is detected below the Lyman limit in any
of our spectra, nor in deep U or B-band images. The UV continua are reproduced
well by early B-stars, although some dust absorption would allow a fit to
hotter stars. After correcting for the lensing, we derive small physical sizes
for our objects, ~0.5-5 kpc/h for a flat cosmology with Omega_m=0.3,
Omega_Lambda=0.7. The lensed images are only marginally resolved in good seeing
despite their close proximity to the critical curve, where large arcs are
visible and hence high magnifications of up to ~20x are inferred. Two objects
show a clear spatial extension of the Ly-alpha emission relative to the
continuum starlight, indicating a ``breakout'' of the gas. The sizes of our
galaxies together with their large gas motion suggests that outflows of gas are
common at high redshift and associated with galaxy formation.

(BHs) in the centres of bulges and elliptical galaxies assuming that these
initially had an isothermal cusp (rho ~ r^{-2} with velocity dispersion
sigma_*). If radial orbits can be adequately replenished a BH can grow
significantly by capturing stars and particles of the dark halo; the latter
could be up to 20--40 percent of the total mass captured. A tight relation M_bh
10^8 (sigma_*/200\kms)^5 between BH hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion
arises at the high mass end M_bh >= 10^8 M_sun if these giant BHs grow
primarily by swallowing stars. For smaller masses a gradual flattening of the
relation and an increase of the scatter are expected due to tidal disruption of
stars. At moderate redshifts when bright galaxies may still possess isothermal
cusps tidal disruption flares may be as frequent as 10^{-4} -- 10^{-2} yr^{-1}
per galaxy, a few percent of the supernovae rate. Efficient randomization of
the orbits can occur when the dense cores of infalling satellites sink to the
sphere of influence of the BH by dynamical friction. Efficient replenishment of
the loss cone of radial orbits can also explain why the supermassive binary BHs
expected in hierarchically merging galaxies do generally coalesce, as suggested
by the observed relation between BH mass and the inferred mass of stars ejected
from an isothermal cusp.

of X-ray to radio, or optical, flux to decline with increasing distance from
the nucleus. At least three knots are displaced from their radio/optical
counterparts, being tens of pc closer to the nucleus at X-ray than at radio or
optical wavelengths. The X-ray spectra of the nucleus and knots are well
described by power laws absorbed by cold gas, with only the unresolved nucleus
exhibiting intrinsic absorption. In view of the similar spectra of the nucleus

suggest that the X-ray emission coincident with the nucleus may actually
originate from the pc - or sub-pc - scale jet rather than the accretion disk.
  Arguments are given that the X-ray emission process is unlikely to be inverse
Compton scattering. Instead, we favor synchrotron radiation. Plotted as
$\nu$S$_{\rm \nu}$, the spectra of the knots generally peak in or just above
the optical - near infrared band. However, the overall spectra of at least
three knots cannot be described by simple models in which the spectral index
monotonically increases with frequency, as would result from synchrotron losses
or a high energy cut-off to the injected electron spectrum. Instead, these
spectra must turn down just above the optical band and then flatten in the
X-ray band. (Abstract truncated)

the two-dimensional radiative transfer equation by means of the Short
Characteristic method in the spherical coordinate in order to determine the
disk structure. Our calculation shows that at the outer region of the disk with
a distance from the central star of x>1AU the radiative heating from the inner
disk dominates the viscous heating even near the midplane. It is because of the
high temperature distribution in the optically thin surface layer and the
relatively high disk height as a consequence of the irradiation from the inner
hot region of the disk. In addition, we examine the convective and the
magnetorotational instabilities of the disk. As a result, the whole disk is
convectively stable since the dusty region is not heated by the viscous
dissipation from the midplane but by the radial radiative heating. On the other
hand, almost all the disk is magnetorotationally unstable except for the region
near the equatorial plane of from 2AU to 10AU. Finally we discuss the growth

three years before. The orbit cannot be strongly constrained yet, but the
observed motion of T Tau Sb with respect to T Tau Sa suggests that the system
is at least as massive as T Tau N itself. This may indicate that T Tau N is not
the most massive star in the system. The spectrum of T Tau Sa, which is totally
featureless except for a strong Br gamma emission line, identifies this
component with the ``infrared companion'', whose exact nature remains obscure
but may be the consequence of it being the most massive component of the
system. Contrasting sharply with T Tau Sa, the spectrum of T Tau Sb shows
numerous photospheric features consistent with an early-M spectral type. The
presence of a strong Br gamma emission line and of a significant veiling
continuum classifies this object as a deeply embedded T Tauri star. From these

own dense circumstellar cocoon of material, which are probably fed by a much
more extended structure.

the entropy excess observed today in low-mass clusters of galaxies without
destroying the bulk of the Lyman alpha forest. Subsequent galaxy formation is
affected by the preheating, because the gas no longer follows the dark matter
on galaxy scales. The hot gas around galaxy haloes has very shallow profiles
and emits only weakly in the X-ray. Cooling in a preheated halo is not
inside-out, because the cooling efficiency does not change significantly with
radius. Only part of the gas in a protogalaxy region can cool and be accreted
into the final galaxy halo. The accreted gas is likely in diffuse clouds and so
does not lose angular momentum to the dark matter. Cluster ellipticals are
produced by mergers of stellar systems formed prior to the preheating, while
large galaxy disks form in low-density environments where gas accretion can
continue to the present time.

the loss function, similar to those directly observed in electron energy loss
experiments. For good metals and insulators, on the other hand, the inelastic
losses not important. We derive quantitative conditions to delineate the

between states of knowledge can be described, rather than transitions between
completely described states of the world, which makes the language well-suited
for planning under incomplete knowledge. Furthermore, it enables the use of
default principles in the planning process by supporting negation as failure.
Nonetheless, K also supports the representation of transitions between states
of the world (i.e., states of complete knowledge) as a special case, which
shows that the language is very flexible. As we demonstrate on particular
examples, the use of knowledge states may allow for a natural and compact
problem representation. We then provide a thorough analysis of the
computational complexity of K, and consider different planning problems,
including standard planning and secure planning (also known as conformant
planning) problems. We show that these problems have different complexities

case. Our results form the theoretical basis for the DLV^K system, which

many acceptable solutions to the solar neutrino problem based on different
conversion mechanisms, for the first time, using the same statistical
procedure. This allows us to do a direct comparison of the goodness of the fit
among different solutions, from which we can discuss and conclude on the
current status of each proposed dynamical mechanism. These solutions are based
on different assumptions: (a) neutrino mass and mixing, (b) non-vanishing
neutrino magnetic moment, (c) the existence of non-standard flavor-changing and
non-universal neutrino interactions and (d) the tiny violation of the
equivalence principle. We investigate the quality of the fit provided by each
one of these solutions not only to the total rate measured by all the solar
neutrino experiments but also to the recoil electron energy spectrum measured
at different zenith angles by the Super-Kamiokande collaboration. We conclude
that several non-standard neutrino flavor conversion mechanisms provide a very
good fit to the experimental data which is comparable with (or even slightly
better than) the most famous solution to the solar neutrino anomaly based on
the neutrino oscillation induced by mass.

cosmological scenario where the ``Big Bang'' hypersurface is the locus of
collision of two vacuum bubbles which nucleate in a five dimensional flat
space. This gives rise to an open universe, where the curvature can be very
small provided that $d/R_0$ is sufficiently large. Here, d is the distance
between bubbles and $R_0$ is their size at the time of nucleation. Quantum
fluctuations develop on the bubbles as they expand towards each other, and
these in turn imprint cosmological perturbations on the initial hypersurface.
We present a simple formalism for calculating the spectrum of such
perturbations and their subsequent evolution. We conclude that, unfortunately,
the spectrum is very tilted, with spectral index $n_s=3$. The amplitude of
fluctuations at horizon crossing is given by $<(\delta \rho/\rho)^2> \sim
(R_0/d)^2 S_E^{-1} k^2$, where $S_E\gg 1$ is the Euclidean action of the
instanton describing the nucleation of a bubble and k is the wavenumber in
units of the curvature scale. The spectrum peaks on the smallest possible
relevant scale, whose wave-number is given by $k\sim d/R_0$. We comment on the
possible extension of our formalism to more general situations where a Big Bang
is ignited through the collision of 4D extended objects.

Considering these theories in terms of the Wilsonian renormalization group

assumption is the existence of the maximal ultraviolet cutoff in a cutoff
theory, and we require that the theory be so fine-tuned as to reach the maximal
cutoff. The theory so obtained behaves as a local continuum theory to the
shortest distance. In concrete examples of the scalar theory we find that at
least in a certain approximation to the Wilsonian RG, this requirement enable
us to make unique predictions in the infrared regime in terms of a finite
number of independent parameters. Therefore, the method might provide a way for
calculating quantum corrections in a low-energy effective theory of quantum

matter and dark matter are incompatible to each other as oil droplet and water
in emulsion. In the interfacial zone between dark matter and baryonic matter,
this incompatibility generates the modification of Newtonian dynamics to keep
dark matter and baryonic matter apart. The five periods of baryonic structure
development in the order of increasing incompatibility are the free baryonic
matter, the baryonic droplet, the galaxy, the cluster, and the supercluster
periods. The transition to the baryonic droplet generates density perturbation
in the CMB. In the galaxy period, the first-generation galaxies include
elliptical, normal spiral, barred spiral, irregular, and dwarf spheroidal
galaxies. In the cluster period, the second-generation galaxies include
modified giant ellipticals, cD, evolved S0, dwarf elliptical, BCD, and tidal
dwarf galaxies. The whole observable expanding universe behaves as one unit of
emulsion with increasing incompatibility between dark matter and baryonic

of the coefficients of curvature-squared terms allows us to have two fixed

further extend our analysis to Minkowski time to investigate a model of

lead to complicated phase transition pattern between various nuclear phases (as
a function of the density). Namely, we show that the relative energies of
different phases are rapidly oscillating functions of the neutron density. In
the semiclassical approach this behavior is explained as an interference effect
due to periodic orbits of similar lengths. We discuss also the dependence of
the shell effects on pairing correlations.

during the search of a target sequence. The model accounts for possible effects
due to sequence-dependent interaction between the nonspecific DNA and the
protein. As an example, we focus on T7 RNA-polymerase and exploit the available
information about its interaction at the promoter site in order to investigate
the influence of bacteriophage T7 DNA sequence on the dynamics of the sliding
process. Hydrogen bonds in the major groove are used as the main
sequence-dependent interaction between RNA-polymerase and DNA. The resulting
dynamical properties and the possibility of an experimental verification are
discussed in details. We show that, while at large times the process reaches a
pure diffusive regime, it initially displays a sub-diffusive behavior. The
subdiffusive regime can lasts sufficiently long to be of biological interest.

Results are derived using a classical hydrodynamic approach followed by
canonical quantization. The classical model, a rigid body immersed in
incompressible fluid, permits a thorough analysis; its effective Hamiltonian
generalizes the usual rigid-rotor Hamiltonian. In contrast to the free rigid
rotor, the immersed body is shown to have chaotic dynamics. Quantization of the
classical model leads to new and experimentally verifiable features. It is
shown, for instance, that chiral molecules can behave as ""quantum propellers"":
the rotational-translational coupling induced by the superfluid leads to a
nonzero linear momentum in the ground state. Hydrogen peroxide is a strong
candidate for experimental detection of this effect. The signature is a
characteristic splitting of rotational absorption lines. The 1_{01} --> 1_{10}
line in hydrogen peroxide, for example, is predicted to split into three lines
separated by as much as 0.01 cm^{-1}, which is about the experimental
linewidth.

arises nearby or beyond the scission point. The importance of cluster
deformation effects in the fission process is elucidated with the use of the
overlapping-spheroids shape parametrization allowing one an independent

gates within the context of the Single Cooper Pair Box (SCB) approach to
quantum computing. Such gates are sufficient to support universal quantum
computation. Quantum gate operations are achieved by applying sequences of
voltages and magnetic fluxes to single qubits or pairs of qubits. Neither the
temporal duration, nor the starting time, of a gate operation is used as a
control parameter. As a result, the quantum gates have a constant and known
duration, and depend upon standard control parameter sequences regardless of
when the gate operation begins. This simplifies the integration of quantum
gates into parallel, synchronous, quantum circuits. In addition, we demonstrate
the ability to fabricate such gates, and large-scale quantum circuits, using
current e-beam lithography technology. These features make the SCB-based scheme
a credible contender for practical quantum computer hardware.

effective Hamiltonian causes systematic errors in the computational subspace

precise effective Hamiltonian. This new effective Hamiltonian reduces the
