Satellite (SWAS), we measured a flux of $\sim 450 $Jy, in a spectrally resolved
line centered on a velocity $v_{LSR} = 25 $km s$^{-1}$ with a full width half

We analyze the line shape in the context of three different radial outflow

  Cosmic Evolution with Galaxy Clusters"", Sesto 2001",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Elliptical and S0 galaxies dominate the galaxy population in nearby rich
clusters such as Coma. Studies of the evolution of the colors, M/L ratios, and
line indices of early-type galaxies indicate that they have been a highly
homogeneous, slowly evolving population over the last ~65% of the age of the
Universe. On the other hand, recent evidence suggests that many early-type
galaxies in clusters have been transformed from spiral galaxies since z~1.
Arguably the most spectacular evidence for such transformations is the
incidence of red merger systems in several high redshift clusters. Due to this
morphological evolution the sample of early-type galaxies at high redshift is
only a subsample of the sample of early-type galaxies at low redshift. This
``progenitor bias'' results in an overestimate of the mean formation redshift
if simple models without morphological transformations are used. Models which
incorporate morphological evolution explicitly can bring the homogeneity, slow
evolution, and morphological transformations into agreement. The modeling shows
that the corrected mean formation redshift of the stars in early-type galaxies
may be as low as z~2 in a Lambda dominated Universe.

Particular attention has been paid on the doublet line ratio, where the
conversion of the short wavelength component arising from the
$2S_{1/2}-2P_{3/2}$ transition into the long wavelengh component for the
transition $2S_{1/2}-2P_{1/2}$ plays an essential role in determining the flux
line ratio of the doublet. We adopted a Monte Carlo technique and the Sobolev
approximation. Our bipolar winds take the form of a cone and are characterised
by the terminal wind velocity, mass loss rate and the opening angle of the
cone. When the observer is in the polar direction and the Sobolev optical depth
is moderate $\tau_{Sob}\simeq 1$, then we mainly obtain profiles with inverted
flux line ratios, where the short wavelength component is weaker than the long
wavelength component. When the observer is in the equatorial direction, we find
that the profiles are characterised by two broad components, where the long
wavelength component is the broader and stronger of the two. We conclude that
the profiles obtained in our model provide qualitative understanding of broad
and inverted intensity ratio of the doublets in symbiotic stars and that the
bipolarity of the stellar winds can be inferred from the broader and stronger
long wavelength components in the doublet.

values, $\tanb$, is one of the most difficult parameters to determine in either
the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) or a general type-II Two-Higgs
Doublet Model (2HDM). Assuming an energy and integrated luminosity of
$\rts=500\gev$ and $\call=2000\fbi$, we show that a very accurate determination
of $\tanb$ will often be possible using Higgs production rates and/or Higgs
decays. Based on a TESLA simulation, and assuming no other light Higgs bosons
and $100\leq m_A \leq 200\gev$, we find that the rate for the process $\epem\to
b\anti b A \to b\anti b b\anti b$ provides an excellent determination of
$\tanb$ at high $\tanb$. In the MSSM Higgs sector, the rate for $\epem\to
b\anti b A+ b\anti b H \to b\anti b b\anti b$ ($\epem\to HA \to b\anti b b\anti
b$) provides a good determination of $\tanb$ at high (low) $\tanb$,
respectively, at moderate $m_A$ values. We also show that direct measurement of
the average total width of the $H$ and $A$ in $\epem\to HA \to b\anti b b\anti
b$ events provides an excellent determination of $\tanb$ at large $\tanb$.

we observe today is from the decay of \phi and its anisotropy is affected by
the primordial fluctuation in the amplitude of the modulus field. As a result,
constraints on the inflaton potential from the CMB anisotropy can be relaxed.
In addition, with the cosmological moduli fields, correlated mixture of
adiabatic and isocurvature fluctuations may be generated, which results in
enhanced CMB angular power spectrum at higher multipoles relative to that of
lower ones. Such an enhancement can be an evidence of late time entropy
production due to the cosmological moduli fields, and may be observed at
on-going and future experiments.

a straightforward characterization in ordinary knot theory: q(K) is the
supremum of the integers f such that the framed knot (K;f) embeds non-trivially
on a fiber surface of a positive torus link. Geometric constructions show that
-\infty < q(K), calculations with link polynomials that q(K) < \infty. The
present paper aims to provide sharper lower bounds (by optimizing the geometry
with positive plats) and more readily calculated upper bounds (by modifying
known link polynomials), and so to compute q(K) for various classes of knots,
such as positive closed braids (for which q(K) = \mu(K)-1) and most positive
pretzels. As an aside, it is noted that a recent result of Kronheimer & Mrowka
implies that q(K) < 0 if K is slice.
  [Additional abstract (December 2001):] A 1995 paper gives a proof that q(K)
equals TB(K), the maximal Thurston-Bennequin invariant of K. Thus the bounds
for, and calculations of q(K) derived in this paper are equally bounds for, or
calculations of, TB(K). Similar (sometimes sharper) results for TB(K) have been
derived more recently by a number of researchers, using a variety of different
methods.

equally spaced identical barriers in a (fixed) finite interval for both finite
and infinite $N$. It was observed that scattering and spectral properties
depend sensitively on the ratio $c$ of spacing to width of the barriers (even
in the limit $N \to \infty$). We compute here the specific heat of an ensemble
of such systems and show that there is critical dependence on this parameter,
as well as on the temperature, strongly suggestive of phase transitions.

  law added",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A common framework for quantum mechanics, thermodynamics and information
theory is presented. It is accomplished by reinterpreting the mathematical
formalism of Everett's many-worlds theory of quantum mechanics and augmenting
it to include preparation according to a given ensemble. The notion of
\emph{directed entanglement} is introduced through which both classical and
quantum communication over quantum channels are viewed as entanglement
transfer. This point is illustrated by proving the Holevo bound and quantum
data processing inequality relying exclusively on the properties of directed
entanglement. Within the model, quantum thermodynamic entropy is also related
to directed entanglement, and a simple proof of the second law of
thermodynamics is given.

"quant-ph/0112167","Nurit Granot","Er'el Granot","Selected elevation in quantum tunneling","4pages,3 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The tunneling through an opaque barrier with a strong oscillating component
is investigated. It is shown, that in the strong perturbations regime (in
contrast to the weak one), higher perturbations rate does not necessarily
improve the activation. In fact, in this regime two rival factors play a role,
and as a consequence, this tunneling system behaves like a sensitive
frequency-shifter device: for most incident particles' energies activation
occurs and the particles are energetically elevated, while for specific
energies activation is depressed and the transmission is very low. This effect
is unique to the strong perturbation regime, and it is totally absent in the
weak perturbation case. Moreover, it cannot be deduced even in the adiabatic
regime. It is conjectured that this mechanism can be used as a
frequency-dependent transistor, in which the device's transmission is governed
by the external field frequency.
