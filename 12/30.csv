  velocity substructure clumps","19 pages; 5 encapsulated figures; Accepted for publication by the
  International Journal of Modern Physics",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In the Cold Dark Matter (hereafter CDM) scenario even isolated density peaks
contain a high fraction of small scale clumps having velocities larger than the
average escape velocity from the structure. These clumps populate
protoclusters, especially in the peripheral regions, r > R_f (where R_f is the
filtering scale). During the cluster collapse and the subsequent secondary
infall, collapsing or infalling clumps (having v<v_esc) interact with the
quoted unbound clumps (or high speed clumps, as we also call them) having v >
v_esc. We study the interaction between these two kind of clumps by means of
the impulse approximation and we find that the collapse of bound clumps is
accelerated with respect to the homogeneous case (Gunn & Gott's model). The
acceleration of the collapse increases with decreasing height of the peak, \nu.
We finally compare the acceleration produced by this effect to the slowing down
effect produced by the gravitational interaction of the quadrupole moment of
the system with the tidal field of the matter of the neighboring proto-clusters
studied in Del Popolo & Gambera. We find that the magnitude of the slowing down
effect is larger than the acceleration produced by the effect studied in this
paper, only in the outskirts of the cluster. We want to stress that the one
which we study in this paper is also present in an isolated protocluster, being
produced by the interaction of the collapsing clumps with the unbound
substructure internal to the collapsing clumps itself while that studied in Del
Popolo & Gambera (1998) is produced by substructure external to the density
peak.

low/hard state) are almost identical, showing a similar shape and rms
amplitude. However, the ratio of the high frequency breaks is very small (~

the black hole mass. This result supports the idea of a small black hole

concentrations. The analysis of the x-evolution of the entropy and the scaling
behaviour of $C_{el}(T)$ and $\rho(T)$ clearly confirm a separation of the
magnetic phase diagram into two regions. The region $x\le0.3$, showing a
concentration independent characteristic temperature $T_o\approx45 {\rm K}$,
while for $x>0.3$ $T_o$ decreases down to $T_o(x=1)\approx15 {\rm K}$. This
characteristic temperature is obtained by scaling the $C_{el}(T,x>0.3)$ results
as a function of the reduced temperature $T/T_o$. At low Pd-content, $T_N$
decreases very rapidly from $T_N = 36 {\rm K}$ in pure CeRh$_2$Si$_2$ to
$T_N=18 {\rm K}$ at x=0.1. With higher Pd concentration it stabilized at
$T_N\approx15 {\rm K}$ whereas the magnitude of the anomalies in $C_{el}(T)$
and in the susceptibility around $T_N$ are further reduced and disappear at
$x\approx0.3$. This is in contrast to the behavior found on the Pd-rich side,
where $T_N$ decreases continuously to zero with increasing Rh content. The
pronounced differences observed between both phase boundaries and the drastic
effect of doping on the Rh rich side suggest an itinerant character in CeRh$_2$
Si$_2$, in contrast to the localized character of CePd$_2$Si$_2$. A further
evidence for the itinerant character in CeRh$_2$Si$_2$ is given by the
$\rho(T)$ dependence observed for $x\le0.3$, which scales with $\rho(T)$ of the
prototype itinerant compound YCo$_2$.

prime factors of an $l$-digit integer $N$ increases exponentially with $l$, at
least using algorithms known at present. Factoring large integers is therefore
conjectured to be intractable classically, an observation underlying the
security of widely used cryptographic codes. Quantum computers, however, could
factor integers in only polynomial time, using Shor's quantum factoring
algorithm. Although important for the study of quantum computers, experimental
demonstration of this algorithm has proved elusive. Here we report an
implementation of the simplest instance of Shor's algorithm: factorization of
${N=15}$ (whose prime factors are 3 and 5). We use seven spin-1/2 nuclei in a
molecule as quantum bits, which can be manipulated with room temperature liquid

for precise control and modelling of complex quantum computers. In particular,
we present a simple, parameter-free but predictive model of decoherence effects
in our system.
