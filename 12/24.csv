D65 (2002) 083502","10.1103/PhysRevD.65.083502",,"astro-ph hep-ph",,"  P and CP violation in cosmology can be manifested as large-scale helical
velocity flows in the ambient plasma and as primordial helical magnetic fields.
We show that kinetic helicity at last scattering leads to
temperature-polarization correlations ($C_l^{TB}$ and $C_l^{EB}$) in the cosmic
microwave background radiation (CMBR) and calculate the magnitude of the
effect. Helical primordial magnetic fields, expected from cosmic events such as
electroweak baryogenesis, can lead to helical velocity flows and hence to
non-vanishing correlations of the temperature and B-type polarization. However
we show that the magnitude of the induced helical flow is unobservably small
because the helical component of a magnetic field is almost force-free. We
discuss an alternate scheme for extracting the helicity of a stochastically
homogeneous and isotropic primordial magnetic field using observations of the
CMBR. The scheme involves constructing Faraday rotation measure maps of the
CMBR and thus determining the sum of the helical and non-helical components of
the primordial magnetic field. The power spectrum of B-type polarization
fluctuations, on the other hand, are sensitive only to the non-helical
component of the primordial magnetic field. The primordial magnetic helicity
can then be derived by combining these two sets of observations.

nova outburst is studied for the lines H-alpha, H-beta, and [O III]. About 1200
flux measurements from 96 objects have been collected from the literature, from
unpublished observations, from the HST archive, or from new narrow-band filter
imaging. For most objects, the distance and reddening is known (or newly
determined), and luminosities were calculated from the observed fluxes. The
luminosity data were combined in five groups, according to nova light curve
type (very fast, fast, moderately fast, slow, recurrent); some objects were
re-assigned to other groups for a better fit of the luminosity data to the
general trend. For very fast, fast and moderately fast novae, the slope of the
[O III] decline is very similar, leading to a basic `switchoff' of [O III]
emission after 11, 23 and 24 years, respectively. For the same speed classes,
the slope of the Balmer luminosity is quite similar. In contrast to all types
of fast novae, the decline in Balmer luminosity is more rapid in slow novae.
However, the slope in [O III] is more gentle; slow novae still show [O III]
emission after 100 years. Thus shells of slow novae are still hot after one
century; the same applies for the shells of the very fast nova GK Per and the
recurrent nova T Pyx, which interact with circumstellar material.In recurrent
novae, [O III] is usually inconspicuous or absent. In objects with giant
companions, the Balmer luminosity decreases very slowly after an outburst,
which may be an effect of line blending of material from the ejecta and the
giant wind. On the other hand, objects with dwarf companions show a very rapid
decline in Balmer luminosity.

introduce some extra degrees of freedom that are necessary for this.

allows one to state a criterion for when self thermalization occurs. This
paradigm also provides a method for calculating the thermalization rate using
the usual formalism of atomic physics for calculating decay rates. We contrast
our prescription for coarse graining, which is somewhat dynamical, with the
earlier approaches that are intrinsically kinematical. An important motivation

the Fourier-Mukai transforms. We first show that the Fourier-Mukai transform on
an abelian surface or a K3 surface does not always preserve the stability, even
for a $\mu$-stable vector bundle. We next provide some positive results on this
problem. Finally we discuss the birational map of moduli spaces on an abelian
surface.

  differential equations with only univalued solutions","The final version, to appear in MMJ",,,"TAU-12/01","math.QA math.CA",,"  Let a second order Fuchsian differential equation with only univalued
solutions have finite singular points at z_1, ..., z_n with exponents
(a_1,b_1), ..., (a_n,b_n). Let the exponents at infinity be (A,B). Then for
fixed generic z_1,...,z_n, the number of such Fuchsian equations is equal to
the multiplicity of the irreducible sl_2 representation of dimension |A-B| in
the tensor product of irreducible sl_2 representations of dimensions |a_1-b_1|,
>..., |a_n-b_n|.
  To show this we count the number of critical points of a suitable function
which plays the crucial role in constructions of the hypergeometric solutions
of the sl_2 KZ equation and of the Bethe vectors in the sl_2 Gaudin model. As a
byproduct of this study we conclude that the Bethe vectors form a basis in the
space of states for the sl_2 inhomogeneous Gaudin model.

stability of the open state.Furtherly from this results was derived a
renormalized potential funtion.

effectively described by modifying the participant number in the one-component
model.

  Recently, E. Novak and the author studied quantum algorithms for high
dimensional integration and dealt with the question, which advantages quantum
computing can bring over classical deterministic or randomized methods for this
type of problem.
  In this paper we give a short introduction to the basic ideas of quantum
computing and survey recent results on high dimensional integration. We discuss
connections to the Monte Carlo methology and compare the optimal error rates of
quantum algorithms to those of classical deterministic and randomized
algorithms.
