also found to decrease when the supercycle was long. The observed variation of
the supercycle corresponds to a variation of ~40 % of the mass-transfer rate
from the secondary star, totally unexpected for this class of objects. We also
detected a hint of ~1800 d periodicity in the variation, whose period is close
to what has been suggested for solar-type cycles for cataclysmic variables
(CVs). If this periodicity is caused by the magnetic activity of the secondary
star, this detection constitutes the first clear evidence of continuing
magnetic activity in CV evolution, even after crossing the period gap. This
activity may partly explain still poorly understood origins of the high
mass-transfer rates in ER UMa-type stars.

explain. A straightforward calculation demonstrates that in contradistinction
to the enduring electrophonic sounds, the electrophonic bursters are not
generated as a consequence of interactions between the meteoroid ablation
plasma and the Earth's geomagnetic field. Here we present a novel and hitherto
unrecorded model for the generation of short--duration pulses in an observer's

of a strong electric field across a shock wave propagating in a plasma. In this
sense, the electrophonic bursters are associated with the catastrophic
disruption of large meteoroids in the Earth's atmosphere. We develop an
equation for the description of the electric field strength in terms of the
electron temperature and the electron volume density. Also, by linking the
electron line density to a meteor's absolute visual magnitude, we obtain a
lower limit to the visual magnitude of electrophonic burster meteors of

generalized compressibility drops sharply at the glass transition, with the
drop becoming more and more abrupt as the measurement time increases. At our
longest measurement times, the drop occurs approximately at the mode coupling
temperature $T_C$. The drop in the linear generalized compressibility occurs at
the same temperature as the peak in the specific heat. By examining the
inherent structure energy as a function of temperature, we find that our
results are consistent with the kinetic view of the glass transition in which
the system falls out of equilibrium. We find no size dependence and no evidence
for a second order phase transition though this does not exclude the
possibility of a phase transition below the observed glass transition
temperature. We discuss the relation between the linear generalized

spin-polarized case the familiar form $\rho_{\uparrow\downarrow}(T) =A T^2$ is
recovered, but the constant of proportionality $A$ diverges logarithmically as
the spin-polarization tends to zero. In the high-temperature regime we obtain
$\rho_{\uparrow \downarrow}(T) = -(\hbar / e^2) (\pi^2 Ry^* /k_B T)$ (where
$Ry^*$ is the effective Rydberg energy) {\it independent} of the density.
Again, this differs from the three-dimensional result, which has a logarithmic
dependence on the density. Two important differences between the spin-drag
transresistivity and the ordinary Coulomb drag transresistivity are pointed
out: (i) The $\ln T$ singularity at low temperature is smaller, in the Coulomb
drag case, by a factor $e^{-4 k_Fd}$ where $k_F$ is the Fermi wave vector and
$d$ is the separation between the layers. (ii) The collective mode contribution
to the spin-drag transresistivity is negligible at all temperatures. Moreover
the spin drag effect is, for comparable parameters, larger than the ordinary

we consider a variant of this correspondence for G-equivariant vector bundles
on the product of a compact Kahler manifold X by a flag manifold G/P, where G
is a complex semisimple Lie group and P is a parabolic subgroup. The
modification that we consider is determined by a filtration of the vector
bundle which is naturally defined by the equivariance of the bundle. The study
of invariant solutions to the modified Hermitian-Einstein equation over XxG/P
leads, via dimensional reduction techniques, to gauge-theoretic equations on X.
These are equations for hermitian metrics on a set of holomorphic bundles on X
linked by morphisms, defining what we call a quiver bundle for a quiver with
relations whose structure is entirely determined by the parabolic subgroup P.
Similarly, the corresponding stability condition for the invariant filtration
over XxG/P gives rise to a stability condition for the quiver bundle on X, and
hence to a Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence. In the simplest case, when the
flag manifold is the complex projective line, one recovers the theory of

  Phys","Commun.Math.Phys. 238 (2003) 1-33","10.1007/s00220-003-0853-1",,"math.DG hep-th math.AG",,"  A twisted quiver bundle is a set of holomorphic vector bundles over a complex
manifold, labelled by the vertices of a quiver, linked by a set of morphisms
twisted by a fixed collection of holomorphic vector bundles, labelled by the
arrows. When the manifold is Kaelher, quiver bundles admit natural
gauge-theoretic equations, which unify many known equations for bundles with
extra structure. In this paper we prove a Hitchin--Kobayashi correspondence for
twisted quiver bundles over a compact Kaehler manifold, relating the existence
of solutions to the gauge equations to a stability criterion, and consider its
application to a number of situations related to Higgs bundles and dimensional
reductions of the Hermitian--Einstein equations.

dynamical and slow evaporative proton emission are both present. In such cases,
the width of the correlation peak provides the most reliable information about
the source size of the fast dynamical component. The maximum of the correlation
function is sensitive to the relative yields from the slow and fast emission
components. Numerically inverting the correlation function allows one to
accurately disentangle fast dynamical from slow evaporative emission and
extract details of the shape of the two-proton source.

to the

terms of the total baryon density. Emphasis is placed on the relation between
the chemical equilibration parameters and the QCD phase boundary. Furthermore,
we trace the essential difference between thermal model analyses of data from
collisions between elementary particles and from heavy ion collisions as due to
a transition from local strangeness conservation to percolation of strangeness
over large volumes, as occurs naturally in a deconfined medium.
  We also discuss predictions of the thermal model for composite particle
production.

photon-nucleon reactions taking the $\pi N, \pi \Delta$, $\rho N$, $\omega N$,
$\eta N, K \Lambda, K \Sigma$ final states into account. Our scheme dynamically
generates the s- and d-wave nucleon resonances N(1535), N(1650) and N(1520) and
isobar resonances $\Delta(1620)$ and $\Delta(1700)$ in terms of quasi-local
interaction vertices. The description of photon-induced processes is based on a
generalized vector-meson dominance assumption which directly relates the
electromagnetic quasi-local 4-point interaction vertices to the corresponding
vertices involving the $\rho$ and $\omega$ fields. We obtain a satisfactory
description of the elastic and inelastic pion- and photon-nucleon scattering
data in the channels considered. The resulting s-wave $\rho$- and
$\omega$-nucleon scattering amplitudes are presented. Using these amplitudes we
compute the leading density modification of the $\rho$ and $\omega$ energy
distributions in nuclear matter. We find a repulsive energy shift for the
$\omega $ meson at small nuclear density but predict considerable strength in
resonance-hole like $\omega$-meson modes. Compared to previous calculations our
result for the $\rho$-meson spectral function shows a significantly smaller
in-medium effect. This reflects a fairly small coupling strength of the N(1520)
resonance to the $\rho N$ channel.

  Analysis"" (5 - 7 December 2001, London), 27 pages, LaTeX",,,,"physics.soc-ph physics.data-an q-fin.ST",,"  Dynamics of the major USA market indices DJIA, S&P, Nasdaq, and NYSE is
analyzed from the point of view of the random walking problem with two-step
correlations of the market moves. The parameters characterizing the stochastic
dynamics are determined empirically from the historical quotes for the daily,
weekly, and monthly series. The results show existence of statistically
significant correlations between the subsequent market moves. The weekly and
monthly parameters are calculated in terms of the daily parameters, assuming
that the Markov chains with two-step correlations give a complete description
of the market stochastic dynamics. We show that the macro- and micro-parameters
obey the renorm group equation. The comparison of the parameters determined
from the renorm group equation with the historical values shows that the Markov
chains approach gives reasonable predictions for the weekly quotes and
underestimates the probability for continuation of the down trend in the
monthly quotes. The return and its dispersion for the ""buy-and-hold"" and
""follow-trend"" strategies are calculated. The problem of how to combine these
two strategies to reduce the dispersion is discussed and its analytical
solution is proposed. The results of the constructing a ""computer-based""
strategy which combines the series analysis with the candlesticks charting
techniques are reported.

Calude, Boris Pavlov","Coins, Quantum Measurements, and Turing's Barrier","23 pages to appear in ""Quantum Information Processing""","Quantum Information Processing, 1, 1--2 (2002), 107--127",,,"quant-ph",,"  Is there any hope for quantum computing to challenge the Turing barrier, i.e.
to solve an undecidable problem, to compute an uncomputable function? According
to Feynman's '82 argument, the answer is {\it negative}. This paper re-opens
the case: we will discuss solutions to a few simple problems which suggest that
{\it quantum computing is {\it theoretically} capable of computing uncomputable
functions}. In this paper a mathematical quantum ""device"" (with sensitivity
$\epsilon$) is constructed to solve the Halting Problem. The ""device"" works on
a randomly chosen test-vector for $T$ units of time. If the ""device"" produces a
click, then the program halts. If it does not produce a click, then either the
program does not halt or the test-vector has been chosen from an {\it
undistinguishable set of vectors} ${\IF}_{\epsilon, T}$. The last case is not
dangerous as our main result proves: {\it the Wiener measure of}
${\IF}_{\epsilon, T}$ {\it constructively tends to zero when} $T$ {\it tends to
infinity}. The ""device"", working in time $T$, appropriately computed, will
determine with a pre-established precision whether an arbitrary program halts
or not. {\it Building the ""halting machine"" is mathematically possible.}
