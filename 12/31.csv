whether primordial black holes preserve the value of $G$ at their formation

the evolution of a background scalar field when a black hole forms from the
collapse of dust in a flat Friedmann universe. Providing the back reaction of
the scalar field on the metric can be neglected, we find that the value of the
scalar field at the event horizon very quickly assumes the background
cosmological value. This suggests that there is very little gravitational
memory.

each dot with its adjacent lead, the spin singlet state consisting of local

exponent -5/2. By introducing a size-dependent probability for dissociation of
a cluster of agents, we show that the exponent characterizing the cluster size
distribution becomes model-dependent and non-universal, with an exponential
cutoff for large cluster sizes. The actions taken by the clusters of agents
generate the price returns, the distribution of which is also characterized by
a model-dependent exponent. When a size-dependent transaction rate is
introduced instead of a size-dependent dissociation rate, it is found that the
distribution of price returns is characterized by a model-dependent exponent
while the exponent for the cluster-size distribution remains unchanged. The
resulting systems provide simplified models of a financial market and yield
power law behaviour with an easily tunable exponent.

characteristic size of group of agents $s_{0}$ is introduced. The fragmentation
and coagulation rates of groups of agents are assumed to depend on the size of
the group. We present results of numerical simulations and mean field analysis.
It is found that the size distribution of groups of agents $n_{s}$ exhibits two
distinct scaling behavior depending on $s \leq s_{0}$ or $s > s_{0}$. For $s
\leq s_{0}$, $n_{s} \sim s^{-(5/2 + \delta)}$, while for $s > s_{0}$, $n_{s}
\sim s^{-(5/2 -\delta)}$, where $\delta$ is a model parameter representing the
sensitivity of the fragmentation and coagulation rates to the size of the
group. Our model thus gives a tunable exponent for the size distribution
together with two scaling regimes separated by a characteristic size $s_{0}$.
Suitably interpreted, our model can be used to represent the formation of
groups of customers for certain products produced by manufacturers. This, in
turn, leads to a distribution in the size of businesses. The characteristic
size $s_{0}$, in this context, represents the size of a business for which the
customer group becomes too large to be kept happy but too small for the
business to become a brand name.

signal, were studied by the autocorrelation function (AFA) and the detrended
fluctuation analysis (DFA) methods. The persistent character of the short- and
middle-range correlations of time series is shown by the slow decay of the
autocorrelation function. The DFA exponent $\alpha$ is significantly larger
than 0.5. The existence of strongly-persistent long-range correlations was
detected only for closed-states fluctuations, with $\alpha=0.98\pm0.02$. The
long-range correlation of the BK channel action is therefore determined by the
character of closed states. The main outcome of this study is that the memory
effect is present not only between successive conducting states of the channel
but also independently within the open and closed states themselves. As the ion

Tutte polynomial is equivalent to an important function in statistical physics,
the Potts model partition function of the $q$-state Potts model, $Z(G,q,v)$,
where $v$ is a temperature-dependent variable. We determine the structure of
the Tutte polynomial for a cyclic clan graph $G[(K_r)_m,L=jn]$ comprised of a
chain of $m$ copies of the complete graph $K_r$ such that the linkage $L$
between each successive pair of $K_r$'s is a join $jn$, and $r$ and $m$ are

presented. The continuous accumulation set of the zeros of $Z$ in the limit $m

polynomials give enumerations of spanning trees and acyclic orientations. Two
theorems are presented that determine the number of spanning trees on

linkage. We report calculations of the number of acyclic orientations for
strips of the square lattice and use these to obtain an improved lower bound on
the exponential growth rate of the number of these acyclic orientations.

Hilbert space of quantum states in the external background X. Symmetry
transformation of a semiclassical system may be viewed as an automorphism of
the semiclassical bundle. Automorphism groups can be investigated with the help
of sections of the bundle: to any automorphism of the bundle one assigns a
transformation of section of the bundle. Infinitesimal properties of
transformations of sections are investigated; correspondence between Lie groups
and Lie algebras is discussed. For gauge theories, some points of the
semiclassical bundle are identified: a gauge group acts on the bundle. For this

is a polynomial algebra if and only if $\lambda$ is minuscule. We also
characterise in general the number of the irreducible components of the

Poincare series of $C_\lambda$ for any $\lambda$, and show that in the
