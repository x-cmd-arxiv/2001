linear transformation to the frame of reference. Two different approaches are
used to carry out the solution. In the first approach the angular derivative is
interpreted in an original way that made it possible to discard this derivative
from the equation for all black body media without upsetting the conservation
of energy. In this approach the analytic solution is expressible in terms of
exponential integrals without approximations but for practical considerations
the solution is presented in the form of Gauss-Legendre quadrature for
quantitative evaluation of the solutions. In the second approach the angular
derivative is approximated by a new set of discrete ordinates that guarantees
the closure of the set of equations and the conservation of energy. The
solutions from the two approaches are numerically identical in homogeneous and
non-homogeneous cold media as well as in local thermodynamic equilibrium and
for all optical depths that can be managed with 16 significant digits
arithmetics without numerical instabilities. The solution in either approach is
made possible by splitting the original transfer equation into two equations,
one for the centripetal energy flow and another one for the centrifugal energy
flow. The end-points form of the solution proved to be very effective in
numerical computations without spatial truncation errors.

gravity, in the sense that the graviton mass must be rigorously zero. This is
because there is a discontinuity in the linearized gravity theory at graviton
mass equal to zero. The linearized Schwarzschild metric is not recovered for
infinitesimal graviton mass, contradicting observations on light deviation by
the Sun and Mercury perihelion advance. It was then argued that
non-perturbative effects make the massive gravity theory continuous in the
graviton mass. Both the original suggestion and its refutation were based on a
non-covariant and linearized action, and the physical interpretation of these
results remained questionable. Here we use a covariant quasi-massive gravity
theory that is known to be discontinuous in the graviton mass in the linear
approximation. We show that non-perturbative effects do restore the continuity;
the weak-field Schwarzschild solution is recovered in the limit of small
graviton mass. We also show that weak-field Schwarzschild with matter is
recovered for infinitesimal graviton mass. Thus: Observations of the solar
system only put an upper limit on the graviton mass (in the context of the
gravity theory that we use, inverse graviton mass, as measured at distances of
order inverse graviton mass, is $\gtrsim 100$ Mpc). But graviton can be
massive, with a cosmologically interesting mass.

molecular cloud L1204/S140, where the far ultraviolet radiation and the density
are relatively low. Our observations test theories of photon-dominated regions
(PDRs) in a regime that has been little explored. CII 158 micron and OI 63
micron lines are detected by ISO at all 16 positions along a 1-dimensional cut
in right ascension. Emission from molecular hydrogen rotational transitions, at
28 and 17 micron, was also detected at several positions. The CII, OI, and
molecular hydrogen intensities along the cut show much less spatial variation
than do the rotational lines of CO and other CO isotopes. The average CII and
OI intensities and their ratio are consistent with models of PDRs with low FUV
radiation (Go) and density. The best-fitting model has Go about 15 and density,
n about 1000 per cubic cm. Standard PDR models underpredict the intensity in
the H2 rotational lines by up to an order of magnitude. This problem has also
been seen in bright PDRs and attributed to factors, such as geometry and
gas-grain drift, that should be much less important in the regime studied here.
The fact that we see the same problem in our data suggests that more
fundamental solutions, such as higher H2 formation rates, are needed. Also, in
this regime of low density and small line width, the OI line is sensitive to
the radiative transfer and geometry. Using the ionization structure of the
models, a quantitative analysis of timescales for ambipolar diffusion in the
peripheral regions of the S140 cloud is consistent with a theory of
photoionization-regulated star formation. Observations of CII in other galaxies
differ both from those of high Go PDRs in our galaxy and from the low Go
regions we have studied. ~

present here the follow-up optical photometric and spectroscopic observations

A1689. Sources with a low [15 micron] / [6.75 micron] flux ratio typically
consist of luminous passive early-type galaxies while those with a high MIR
color index are mainly luminous, blue, emission-line, morphologically disturbed
spirals, i.e. the star-forming galaxies usually associated with the
'Butcher-Oemler' effect. On the other hand, at least 30% of the 15 micron
sources have optical counterparts showing no evidence of current star-formation
activity, while their 15 micron emission is most likely due to obscured star
formation. We argue that the LW3 luminosity measured in the cluster members is
a reliable tracer of the total infrared luminosity, L(IR). We derive from L(IR)
a star-formation rate free of dust extinction, SFR(IR), which we compare with
that determined in the optical from the flux of the [OII] emission line,
SFR(opt). The highest total star formation rates (11 Msun/yr) and dust
extinction are measured in those galaxies exhibiting in their optical spectrum
a signature of a dusty starburst. In contrast, none of the galaxies with
post-starburst optical spectra has been detected by ISOCAM. We find a median
SFR(IR) of the LW3-detected galaxies of 2 Msun/yr, that is ten times higher
than the median SFR(opt) of the [OII] detected galaxies. The ratio
SFR(IR)/SFR(opt) is in fact very high, ranging between 10 and 100 for
LW3-detected galaxies with [OII] emission. We conclude that a major part, at

ages of the open clusters are all on an internally consistent system, while the
K(RC) values are measured from the 2MASS data. For clusters younger than ~2
Gyr, Mk(RC) is insensitive to metallicity but shows a dependence on age. In
contrast, for clusters older than ~2 Gyr, Mk(RC) is influenced primarily by the
metallicity of the population and shows little or no dependence on the age.
Theoretical red clump models based on the formalism of Girardi et al. reinforce
this finding. Over comparable metallicity and age ranges, our average Mk(RC)
value is in accord with that based on solar-neighborhood red clump stars with
HIPPARCOS parallaxes. Lastly, we compute the distance to the open cluster NGC

probed within light hours of the central black hole. Though we concur with
Maloney & Reynolds that the direct continuum is not observed, this variability
coupled with the 188 eV upper limit on the equivalent width of the FeKalpha

  We discuss the implausibility that these stars could be any kind of survey
contaminant. If {\it bona fide} white dwarfs, the eight candidates found here
represent a portion of the white dwarf population hitherto uninvestigated by
previous surveys by virtue of the faint magnitudes and low proper motions. The
newly discovered stars suggest a disk white dwarf scaleheight larger than the
values of 250-350 pc typically assumed in assessments of the local white dwarf
density. Both a <V/V_{max}> and a more complex maximum likelihood analysis of
the spatial distribution of our likely thin disk white dwarfs yield
scaleheights of 400-600 pc while at the same time give a reasonable match to
the local white dwarf volume density found in other surveys.
  Our results could have interesting implications for white dwarfs as potential
MACHO objects. We can place some direct constraints (albeit weak ones) on the
contribution of halo white dwarfs to the dark matter of the Galaxy. Moreover,
the elevated scale height that we measure for the thin disk could alter the
interpretation of microlensing results to the extent of making white dwarfs
untenable as the dominant MACHO contributor. (Abridged)

spectrum we measure the strengths and an average profile of the observed X-ray
lines. We also analyze a high signal-to-noise ratio CCD spectrum obtained in
2000 December. The good statistics (~ 9250 counts) of this spectrum and the
high spatial resolution provided by the telescope allow us to perform
spectroscopic analyses of different regions of the remnant. We discuss the
relevant shock physics that can explain the observed X-ray emission. The X-ray
spectra are well fit by plane parallel shock models with post-shock electron
temperatures of ~ 2.6 keV and ionization ages of ~ 6 x 10^10 cm^3/s. The
combined X-ray line profile has a FWHM of ~ 5000 km/s, indicating a blast wave
speed of ~ 3500 km/s. At this speed, plasma with a mean post-shock temperature
of ~ 17 keV is produced. This is direct evidence for incomplete electron-ion
temperature equilibration behind the shock. Assuming this shock temperature, we
constrain the amount of collisionless electron heating at the shock front at
T_e0 / T_s = 0.11 (+0.02,-0.01). We find that the plasma has low metallicity
(abundances are ~ 0.1 -- 0.4 solar) and is nitrogen enriched (N/O ~ 0.8 by
number), similar to that found for the equatorial ring. Analysis of the spectra
from different regions of the remnant reveals slight differences in the
parameters of the emitting plasma. The plasma is cooler near the optical Spot 1
(at position angle ~ 30 degrees) and in the eastern half of the remnant, where

that the most likely energy source for this quiescent luminosity is the
gravitational compression of the WD interior, which rejuvenates an otherwise

compressional heating of WD's, extending down to the very low time averaged

of T_eff as a function of <Mdot> during the cycle, we also self-consistently

ejected masses will tell us whether the WD mass in CV's is secularly increasing

significant fraction of the optical light in addition to the quiescent disk and
main sequence companion. Hence, identifying a faint, quiescent CV in either the
field or a globular cluster (GC) from broadband colors depends on our ability
to predict the WD contribution in quiescence. We are undertaking a theoretical
study of the compressional heating of WDs, extending down to very low time
averaged accretion rates, <Mdot>~10^{-11}M_sun/yr, which allows us to

WD core temperature reaches a fixed value on a timescale less than typical
evolutionary times. Since nuclear burning is unstable at these <Mdot>'s, we
have incorporated the recurrent heating and cooling of the WD core throughout
the classical novae limit cycle in order to find the T_eff-<Mdot> relations.
Comparing to observations of field DN confirms the <Mdot>-P_orb relation of
disrupted magnetic braking. We also predict broad-band colors of a quiescent CV

X-ray luminosity-temperature relation in groups and clusters, the galaxy
formation-regulated gas evolution (GG) model proposed recently by Bryan makes
an attempt to incorporate the formation of galaxies into the evolution of gas
without additional heating by nongravitational processes. This seems to provide
a unified scheme for our understanding of the structures and evolution of both
galaxies and gas in groups and clusters. In this paper, we present an extensive
comparison of the X-ray properties of groups and clusters predicted by the GG
model and those revealed by current X-ray observations, using various large
data sources in the literature and also taking the observational selection
effects into account. These include an independent check of the fundamental
working hypothesis of the GG model, i.e., galaxy formation was less efficient
in rich clusters than in groups, a new test of the radial gas distributions
revealed by both the gas mass fraction and the X-ray surface brightness
profiles, and an reexamination of the X-ray luminosity-temperature and
entropy-temperature relations. In particular, it shows that the overall X-ray
surface brightness profiles predicted by the GG model are very similar in
shape, insensitive to the X-ray temperature, and the shallower X-ray surface
brightness profiles seen at low-temperature systems may arise from the current
observational selection effect. This can be used as the simplest approach to
distinguishing between the GG model and the preheating scenario. The latter
yields an intrinsically shallower gas distribution in groups than in rich
clusters.

molecular gas properties of galaxies spanning a large range of morphological
types and luminosities and belonging to different environments (clusters -
field). The molecular gas content of the target galaxies is estimated using a
luminosity-dependent X = $N(H_2)/I(CO)$ conversion factor that has been
calibrated on a sample of nearby galaxies. $X$ spans from $\sim$ 10$^{20}$ mol
cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1})^{-1}$ in giant spirals to $\sim$ 10$^{21}$ mol
cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1})^{-1}$ in dwarf irregulars. The value of the $X$
conversion factor is found consistent with a value derived independently from
dust masses estimated from FIR fluxes, with a metallicity-dependent dust to gas
ratio. The relationships between X and the UV radiation field (as traced by the
$H\alpha+[NII] E.W.$), the metallicity and the H band luminosity are analysed.
We show that the molecular gas contained in molecular clouds or complexes is of
the order of 15% of the total gas on average whatever the luminosity or the

anisotropies is most naturally expressed in Fourier space, pixelised maps are

complementary approach is investigated here, in which maps are used only in the

are only ever expressed in terms of their spherical multipoles. This approach
has a number of advantages: there is no information loss (assuming a
band-limited observation); deconvolution of asymmetric beam profiles and the
temporal response of the instrument are naturally included; correlated noise
can easily be taken into account, removing the need for additional destriping;
polarization is also analysed in the same framework; and reliable estimates of
the spherical multipoles of the sky and their errors are obtained directly for
subsequent component separation and power spectrum estimation. The formalism
required to analyse experiments which survey the full sky by scanning on

number of analytical results are obtained in the limit of simple scanning
strategies. Although there are non-trivial computational obstacles to be
overcome before the techniques described here can be implemented at high

studies to demonstrate that the optical emission region is much smaller than
the ER for solar-mass objects. For the majority of the monitoring history, the
optical flux ratios have differed significantly from those predicted by
macro-models. In contrast, recent observations in mid-IR show flux ratios
similar to those measured in the radio, and to predictions of some lens models,
implying that the mid-IR flux is emitted from a region that is at least 2
orders of magnitude larger than the optical emission region. We have calculated
the likeli-hood of the observed mid-IR flux ratio as a function of mid-IR
source size given the observed V-band flux ratio. The expected flux ratio for a
source having dimensions of ~1 ER is a sensitive function of the macro model
adopted. However we find that the probability of source size given the observed
flux ratios is primarily sensitive to the ratio of the macro-model
magnifications. The majority of published macro models for Q2237+0305 yield a
flux ratio for images B and A of 0.8 - 1.1. By combining probabilities from the
ratios A/B and C/D we infer that the diameter of a circular IR emission region
is >1ER with >95% confidence. For microlensing by low-mass stars, this source
size limit rules out non-thermal processes such as synchrotron as mechanisms
for mid-IR emission.

observed during the solidification of ternary alloys when the composition is
close to a binary eutectic valley. In analogy with the solidification cells
formed in dilute binary alloys, colony formation is triggered by a
morphological instability of a macroscopically planar eutectic solidification
front due to the rejection by both solid phases of a ternary impurity that
diffuses in the liquid. Here we develop a phase-field model of a binary
eutectic with a dilute ternary impurity and we investigate by dynamical
simulations both the initial linear regime of this instability, and the
subsequent highly nonlinear evolution of the interface that leads to fully
developed two-phase cells with a spacing much larger than the lamellar spacing.
We find a good overall agreement with our recent linear stability analysis [M.
Plapp and A. Karma, Phys. Rev. E 60, 6865 (1999)], which predicts a
destabilization of the front by long-wavelength modes that may be stationary or
oscillatory. A fine comparison, however, reveals that the assumption commonly
attributed to Cahn that lamella grow perpendicular to the envelope of the
solidification front is weakly violated in the phase-field simulations. We show
that, even though weak, this violation has an important quantitative effect on
the stability properties of the eutectic front. We also investigate the
dynamics of fully developed colonies and find that the large-scale envelope of
the composite eutectic front does not converge to a steady state, but exhibits
cell elimination and tip-splitting events up to the largest times simulated.

plane-^63Cu NQR line frequency nu_Q(Cu2) and the linewidth in normal and
superconducting ^16O and ^18O exchanged YBa_2Cu_4O_8. Whereas nu_Q(Cu2) passes
T_c very smoothly without a discontinuity either in value nor in slope, the
linewidth increases in the normal conducting phase down to T_c and starts to
decrease sharply in the superconducting phase to finally resume its
high-temperature value of the normal phase. There is a well discernible oxygen
isotope effect on the nu_Q(Cu2) temperature dependencies. The temperature
dependence of nu_Q(Cu2) is described by an empirical expression consisting of
two parts: one related to the thermal expansion of the lattice and the other
due to charge redistribution during the formation of new electronic structures
in the CuO_2 planes. From the fit to the experimental data we determine for the
conjectured formation of new electronic structures an energy scale Delta(^16O)
= 188.0(1.6) K and Delta(^18O) = 180.0(1.6) K. This results in a partial oxygen
isotope effect coefficient of 0.42(11) which is larger than both the
spin-pseudogap coefficient [0.061(8)] and the T_c coefficient [0.056(12)].

so-called quasi-metric framework. The basic geometric structure underlying
quasi-metric relativity is quasi-metric space-time; this is defined as a
4-dimensional differentiable manifold ${\cal N}$ equipped with two
one-parameter families ${\bf {\bar g}}_t$ and ${\bf g}_t$ of Lorentzian
4-metrics parametrized by a global time function $t$. The metric family ${\bf
{\bar g}}_t$ is found from field equations, whereas the metric family ${\bf
g}_t$ is used to propagate sources and to compare predictions to experiments. A
linear and symmetric affine connection compatible with the family ${\bf g}_t$
is defined, giving rise to equations of motion.
  Furthermore a quasi-metric theory of gravity, including field equations and
local conservation laws, is presented. Just as for General Relativity, the
field equations accommodate two independent propagating dynamical degrees of
freedom. On the other hand, the particular structure of quasi-metric geometry
allows only a partial coupling of space-time geometry to the active
stress-energy tensor. Besides, the field equations are defined from projections
of physical and geometrical tensors with respect to a ""preferred"" foliation of
quasi-metric space-time into spatial hypersurfaces. Moreover, a number of
non-standard features make the field equations unsuitable for a standard
PPN-analysis. This implies that the experimental status of the theory is not
completely clear at this point in time. The theory seems to be consistent with
a number of cosmological observations and it satisfies all the classical solar
system tests, though. Moreover, in its non-metric sector, the new theory has
experimental support where General Relativity fails or is irrelevant.

mapping to the 4-dimensional effective theory is given by a simple scaling of

confirmed, and is the full SUGRA parameter space accessible to future planned
detectors. Experimental constraints of the Higgs mass bound, the b-> s\gamma
bound, relic density constraints (including all co-annihilation channels), etc.

examined. For mSUGRA, we find that the Higgs mass and b\to s\gamma constraint
puts a lower bound m_{1/2} > (300 - 400) GeV (i.e. m_{\tilde\chi^0_1} > (120 -
160) GeV) for \tan\beta < 50, and thus the largest theoretical
neutralino-proton cross sections still lie significantly below the DAMA 3\sigma
lower bound. (Predictions for \tan\beta> 50 become sensitive to the precise
value of m_t and m_b.) If in addition one imposes the muon anomaly constraint,
\mu must be positive and an upper bound of m_{1/2}< 850 GeV for \tan\beta < 50

are >~ 10^{-10} pb, and hence this parameter space would be mostly accessible

non-universal soft breaking in the Higgs and third generation is seen to give

that a significant component of gravity that we feel at intermediate distances
(1 mm < r < 10^26 cm) is due to massive but ultralight gravitons. We
demonstrate how this phenomenon can be realized in brane-world models in a
spacetime with more than four dimensions and discuss how modifications of
gravity at cosmological scales emerge as a consequence. Firstly, we consider
five dimensional multigravity models with flat branes. We see how the existence
of freely moving negative tension branes gives rise to ultralight graviton
Kaluza-Klein states. Secondly, we study the moduli corresponding to the
position of the branes and the size of the extra dimension, the radions and the
dilaton respectively. We show that the radions corresponding to negative
tension branes have wrong sign kinetic term. We also derive a stabilization
condition for the dilaton in a brane model with general bulk scalar field
dynamics. Thirdly, we show how we can reproduce the five dimensional
multigravity models with Anti-de Sitter branes of positive tension only.
Moreover, we demonstrate how the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity can be
circumvented at tree level in Anti-de Sitter space. Finally, we discuss how the
above multigravity models can be replicated in six dimensions with flat
positive tension branes. This last possibility is the first theoretically and
phenomenologically viable realization of the multigravity scenario.

discrete symmetries of the bulk three-dimensional field theory. Multi-loop
bosonic string vacuum amplitudes are thereby computed as bulk correlation
functions of the gauge theory. It is shown that the three-dimensional
correlators naturally reproduce twisted and untwisted sectors in the case of
closed worldsheet orbifolds, and Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions in
the case of open ones. The bulk wavefunctions are used to explicitly construct
the characters of the underlying extended Kac-Moody group for arbitrary genus.

ergodicity/transience in terms of the geometric properties of the matrix

vertices and quite stringent conditions on the transition probabilities but on
general trees has been considered previously in the literature LyoPem. In the
presentation we give here, we restrict the study of the process on a regular
graph instead of the irregular graph used in LyoPem. The close connection
between various problems on random walks in random environment and the so
called multiplicative chaos martingale is underlined by showing that the
classification of the random walk problem can be drawn by the corresponding
classification for the multiplicative chaos, at least for those situations
where both problems have been solved by independent methods. The chaos
counterpart of the problem we considered here has not yet been solved. The
results we obtain for the random walk problem localise the position of the
critical point. We conjecture that the additional conditions needed for the
chaos problem to have non trivial solutions will be the same as the ones needed
for the random walk to be null recurrent.

theoretically predicted changes on the $\rho $ properties in the nuclear
medium. In the second case one wishes to investigate the modifications of the
$\pi \pi$ interaction in the nuclear medium in the region of the $\sigma$
meson. In the first case we observe that it is quite difficult to see large
effects due to the $\rho$ modification in the medium because the detection of
the $\rho $ is done through the two pions which are produced in the $\Delta$
region and are largely distorted in the medium. In the second case, when the
I=0 part of the $\pi \pi$ interaction is substituted by the in medium $\pi \pi$
amplitude, we observe a very large shift of strength in the invariant mass
distribution to small values of the mass in $^{12}C$ and $^{208}Pb$ with
respect to the distribution of the elementary reaction. This spectacular shift
appears to be corroborated by recent experiments at Mainz reported in this same

in mutation rates that depend on the identity of the neighboring bases. An
analytic solution for this class of non-equilibrium models is developed by
adopting well-known methods of nonlinear dynamics. Results are presented for
the CpG-methylation-deamination process which dominates point substitutions in
vertebrates. The dinucleotide frequencies generated by the model (using
empirically obtained mutation rates) match the overall pattern observed in
non-coding DNA. A web-based tool has been constructed to compute single- and
dinucleotide frequencies for arbitrary neighbor-dependent mutation rates.
Alsoprovided is the backward procedure to infer the mutation rates using
maximum likelihood analysis given the observed single- and dinucleotide
frequencies. Reasonable estimates of the mutation rates can be obtained very
efficiently, using generic non-coding DNA sequences as input, after masking
outlong homonucleotide subsequences. Our method is much more convenient and
versatile to use than the traditional method of deducing mutation rates by
counting mutation events in carefully chosen sequences. More generally, our
approach provides a more realistic but still tractable description of
non-coding genomic DNA, and may be used as a null model for various sequence
analysis applications.

the absence of these excited energies. We also show that in the presence of
