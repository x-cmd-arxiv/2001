rejuvenate the shell of the associated supernova remnant. The morphology of the

spindown energy is deposited by the pulsar as a relativistic pulsar wind, and
has a sufficient power to explain the observed radio emission observed in these
remnants. Shull et al. (1989) did {\it not} explain the observed lengthscales
of the rejuvenated parts of the SNR shell. therefore one needs to consider the
diffusive transport of the injected electrons by the pulsar wind. We propose to
apply a diffusion mechanism as introduced by Jokipii (1987), which makes a
distinction between diffusion along the magnetic field lines and perpendicular
to the magnetic field lines, parameterised by the gyro factor $\eta$. We show
that one has to assume a high value for the gyro factor, $\eta\simeq
10^3-10^4$, i.e. diffusion of the electrons along the magnetic field line is
much faster then perpendicular to the magnetic field line, in order for the
rejuvenation mechanism to work on the observed lengthscales.

fronts, the flux of returning positrons and present the heating efficiencies
and X-ray luminosities. We revise pulsar death lines implying cessation of pair
formation, and present them in surface magnetic field-period space. We find
that virtually all known radio pulsars are capable of producing pairs by
resonant and non-resonant ICS photons radiated by particles accelerated above
the PC in a pure star-centered dipole field, so that our ICS pair death line
coincides with empirical radio pulsar death. Our calculations show that ICS
pairs are able to screen the accelerating electric field only for high neutron
star surface temperatures and magnetic fields. We argue that such screening at
ICS pair fronts occurs locally, slowing but not turning off acceleration of
particles until screening can occur at a curvature radiation (CR) pair front at
higher altitude. In the case where no screening occurs above the PC surface, we
anticipate that the pulsar gamma-ray luminosity will be a substantial fraction
of its spin-down luminosity. The X-ray luminosity resulting from PC heating by
ICS pair fronts is significantly lower than the PC heating luminosity from CR
pair fronts, which dominates for most pulsars. PC heating from ICS pair fronts
is highest in millisecond pulsars, which cannot produce CR pairs, and may
account for observed thermal X-ray components in the spectra of these old
pulsars.

Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs. We show that in the presence of a bias voltage,
which is smaller than the energy gap in the SC, a stationary current of
spin-entangled electrons can flow from the SC to the LL leads due to Andreev
tunneling events. We discuss two competing transport channels for Cooper pairs
to tunnel from the SC into the LL leads. On the one hand, the coherent
tunneling of two electrons into the same LL lead is shown to be suppressed by
strong LL correlations compared to single-electron tunneling into a LL. On the
other hand, the tunneling of two spin-entangled electrons into different leads
is suppressed by the initial spatial separation of the two electrons coming
from the same Cooper pair. We show that the latter suppression depends
crucially on the effective dimensionality of the SC. We identify a regime of
experimental interest in which the separation of two spin-entangled electrons
is favored. We determine the decay of the singlet state of two electrons
injected into different leads caused by the LL correlations. Although the
electron is not a proper quasiparticle of the LL, the spin information can
still be transported via the spin density fluctuations produced by the injected
spin-entangled electrons.

lattice QCD. We first derive a tree-level improved clover quark action on the
anisotropic lattice for arbitrary quark mass. The heavy quark mass dependences
of the improvement coefficients, i.e. the ratio of the hopping parameters
$\zeta=K_t/K_s$ and the clover coefficients $c_{s,t}$, are examined at the tree
level. We then compute the charmonium spectrum in the quenched approximation
employing $\xi = a_s/a_t = 3$ anisotropic lattices. Simulations are made with
the standard anisotropic gauge action and the anisotropic clover quark action
at four lattice spacings in the range $a_s$=0.07-0.2 fm. The clover
coefficients $c_{s,t}$ are estimated from tree-level tadpole improvement. On
the other hand, for the ratio of the hopping parameters $\zeta$, we adopt both
the tree-level tadpole-improved value and a non-perturbative one. We calculate
the spectrum of S- and P-states and their excitations. The results largely
depend on the scale input even in the continuum limit, showing a quenching
effect. When the lattice spacing is determined from the $1P-1S$ splitting, the
deviation from the experimental value is estimated to be $\sim$30% for the
S-state hyperfine splitting and $\sim$20% for the P-state fine structure. Our
results are consistent with previous results at $\xi = 2$ obtained by Chen when
the lattice spacing is determined from the Sommer scale $r_0$. We also address
the problem with the hyperfine splitting that different choices of the clover
coefficients lead to disagreeing results in the continuum limit.

of two-point interactions alone. It depends on a physical scale $b_s$ and the
temperature $T$. The temperature-dependence appears with respect to the
spacelike monopole couplings in the deconfinement phase, whereas the timelike
monopole couplings do not show any appreciable temperature-dependence. The
dimensional reduction of the 4-dimensional SU(2) gluodynamics ((SU(2))$_{4D}$)
at high temperature is the 3-dimensional Georgi-Glashow model ($(GG)_{3D}$).
The latter is studied at the parameter region obtained from the dimensional red

which couple with the strength of ordinary QCD axions, we obtain much more
stringent experimental limits on the four-dimensional Peccei-Quinn breaking
scale f_{PQ}, compared with the solar QCD axion limit. Specifically, for the

particular we concentrate over a class of algebras, that we will call
self-conjugated, having the property of possessing equivalent right and left
multiplication algebras. In this case it is always possible to define an
integral sharing many of the properties of the usual integral. For instance, if
the algebra has a continuous group of automorphisms, the corresponding
derivations are such that the usual formula of integration by parts holds. We
discuss also how to integrate over subalgebras. Many examples are discussed,
starting with Grassmann algebras, where we recover the usual Berezin's rule.
The paraGrassmann algebras are also considered, as well as the algebra of
matrices. Since Grassmann and paraGrassmann algebras can be represented by
matrices we show also that their integrals can be seen in terms of traces over

algebras where we show that our definition of integral is equivalent to a sum
over the unitary irreducuble representations of the group. We show also some
example of integration over non self-conjugated algebras (the bosonic and the
$q$-bosonic oscillators), and over non-associative algebras (the octonions).

from SIS up to collider energies is presented. A statistical model assuming
chemical equilibrium and local strangeness conservation (i.e. strangeness
conservation per collision) explains most of the observed features.
  Emphasis is put onto the study of $K^+$ and $K^-$ emission at low incident
energies. In the framework of this statistical model it is shown that the
experimentally observed equality of $K^+$ and $K^-$ rates at
``threshold-corrected'' energies $\sqrt{s} - \sqrt{s_{th}}$ is due to a
crossing of two excitation functions. Furthermore, the independence of the
$K^+$ to $K^-$ ratio on the number of participating nucleons observed between
SIS and RHIC is consistent with this model.
  It is demonstrated that the $K^-$ production at SIS energies occurs
predominantly via strangeness exchange and this channel is approaching chemical
equilibrium. The observed maximum in the $K^+/\pi^+$ excitation function is
also seen in the ratio of strange to non-strange particle production. The
appearance of this maximum around 30 $A\cdot$GeV is due to the energy
dependence of the chemical freeze-out parameters $T$ and $\mu_B$.

trivial property of classical electromagnetism. Splitting the total, genuine
electromagnetic field into the sum of a conventional field and a zero point
field is physically meaningless. If a receiver attenuates the genuine field
down to a zero conventional field, it remains a zero point field having the
coherence and the phase of the conventional field, and vice-versa for the
amplification of the zero point field by a source.
  Nonlinear optical effects must be written using the genuine field, so that at
low light levels they become linear in relation to the conventional field. The
result of the interpretation of all observations, even at low light levels, is
exactly the same in quantum electrodynamics and in the semi-classical theory.
  The zero point field is stochastic only far from the sources and the
receivers; elsewhere, it is shaped by matter, it may be studied through fields
visible before an absorption or after an amplification.

the use of the impulsive stimulated Raman scattering with ordinary incoherent
