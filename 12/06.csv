Cloud (SMC) is modelled using a mixture of amorphous silicate and carbonaceous
grains, including a population of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
molecules. (1) It is shown that this dust model is able to reproduce the
spectral energy distribution from near-IR to far-IR for the entire SMC Bar
region, provided the PAH abundance in the SMC Bar region is very low. (2) The
IR spectrum of the SMCB1#1 molecular cloud can also be reproduced by our dust
model provided the PAH abundance is increased relative to the overall SMC Bar.
The PAHs in SMCB1#1 incorporate ~3% of the SMC C abundance, compared to <0.4%
in the SMC Bar. (3) The spectrum of SMCB1#1 is best reproduced if the PAH
mixture has intrinsic IR band strengths which differ from the band strengths
which best fit Milky Way PAH mixtures. The variation in the PAH IR band
strengths would imply different PAH mixtures, presumably a consequence of
differing metallicity or environmental conditions. Other possibilities such as
super-hydrogenation of PAHs and softening of the starlight spectrum are also
discussed.

at 6.49 +/- 0.09 keV (rest-frame) with an equivalent width of ~ 190eV
consistent with fluorescence from a cold medium is detected at the 99 percent
confidence level in the spectrum of the brightest image A. During the last two
observations of our monitoring program we detected a five-fold increase of the
equivalent width of a narrow Fe Ka line in the spectrum of image B but not in
the brighter image A whereas image C is too faint to resolve the line. The
continuum emission component of image B did not follow the sudden enhancement
of the iron line in the last two observations. We propose that the sudden
increase in the iron line strength from ~ 190eV to 900eV only in image B can be
explained with a caustic crossing due to microlensing that selectively enhances
a strip of the line emission region of the accretion disk. The non-enhancement
of the continuum emission in the spectrum of image B suggests that the
continuum emission region is concentrated closer to the center of the accretion
disk than the iron line emission region and the magnification caustic has not
reached close enough to the former region to amplify it. A model of a caustic
crossing event predicts discontinuities in the light-curve of the magnification
and provides an upper limit of ~ 5 x 10^(-4) pc on the outer radius of the Fe
Ka emission region. The non-detection of any relativistic or Doppler shifts of
the iron line in the spectrum of image B implies that the magnification caustic
for the last two observations was located at a radius greater than ~ 100

described by the singular isothermal sphere (SIS) approximation and by its
generalization as proposed by Navarro, Frenk, & White (NFW) which has a density
profile \rho \propto r^{-\alpha} in the innermost region. The time delay
distribution is very sensitive to these profiles; steeper inner slopes tend to
produce larger time delays. For example, if H_0=70 km/s/Mpc, a
\Lambda-dominated cosmology and a source redshift z_S=1.27 are assumed, lenses
with \theta=5'' produce a time delay of \Delta t[yr]=1.5^{+1.7}_{-0.9},
0.39^{+0.37}_{-0.22}, 0.15^{+0.11}_{-0.09}, and 0.071^{+0.054}_{-0.038} (50%

determined by the difference in the lensing potential between the position of
the two images, which typically occur at different impact parameters. Although
the values of \Delta t are proportional to the inverse of H_0, P(\Delta
t|\theta) is rather insensitive to all other cosmological model parameters,
source redshifts, magnification biases and so on. A knowledge of P(\Delta

At heliocentric distances of 35-50 AU, single annulus and multiannulus
planetesimal accretion calculations produce several 1000 km or larger planets
and many 50-500 km objects on timescales of 10-30 Myr in a Minimum Mass Solar
Nebula. Planets form more rapidly in more massive nebulae. All models yield two
power law cumulative size distributions, N_C propto r^{-q} with q = 3.0-3.5 for
radii larger than 10 km and N_C propto r^{-2.5} for radii less than 1 km. These
size distributions are consistent with observations of Kuiper Belt objects
acquired during the past decade. Once large objects form at 35-50 AU,
gravitational stirring leads to a collisional cascade where 0.1-10 km objects
are ground to dust. The collisional cascade removes 80% to 90% of the initial

the nature of outburst mechanism and studies of GRB afterglows. These issues

In this paper we consider the proposed binary star progenitors of GRBs: white
dwarf neutron star binaries, white dwarf black hole binaries, helium core
neutron star mergers, helium core black hole mergers, double neutron stars and
neutron star black hole binaries. Using population synthesis methods we
calculate merger rates of these binary progenitors and we compare them to the
observed BATSE GRB rate. We also calculate the distribution of merger sites
around host galaxies and compare them to the observed locations of GRB
afterglows with respect to their hosts. We find that the rates of binary GRB
progenitors in our standard model are lower than the observed GRB rates if GRBs
are highly collimated. However, the uncertainty in the population synthesis
results is too large to make this a firm conclusion. Although some
observational signatures seem to point to collapsars as progenitors of long
GRBs, we find that mergers of WD-NS, He-NS, He-BH, and NS-NS systems also trace
the star formation regions of their host galaxies, as it is observed for long
GRBs. We also speculate about possible progenitors of short-duration GRBs. For
these, the most likely candidates are still mergers of compact objects. We find
that the locations NS-NS and NS-BH mergers with respect to their hosts are
significantly different. This may allow to distinguish between these two
progenitor models, once current and near future missions, such as HETE-II or

deriving analytic expressions for the relations between binary lensing

including their evolution with time are calculated consistently leaving the
initial WD and the description of the nuclear burning front the free
parameters. We cover the entire range of normal to subluminous SNeIa. From this
model set, one was selected for SN99by by matching properties of the synthetic
& observed optical light curves. We find DD models require a certain amount of
burning during the deflagration phase setting a lower limit for the absolute
brightness. For SN1999by, a model close to the minimum 56Ni production is
required. Without tuning,good agreement has been found between synthetic and
observed IR spectra. In contrast to 'normal' SNeIa and prior to maximum, the
NIR spectra of SN1999by are dominated by products of explosive carbon burning.
Spectra taken after maximum are dominated by products of incomplete Si burning.
Pure deflagration scenarios or mergers are unlikely. However,problems for DD
models still remain, as the data seem to be at odds with recent predictions
from 3-D models which find significant mixing of the inner layers. Possible
solutions include the effects of rapid rotation on the propagation of nuclear
flames, or extensive burning of carbon just prior to the runaway.

show that, with this method, it could be possible to give an estimate of the

theoretical evolutionary expectations giving the ``feeling'' of a full

completely relying on the method, further tests are needed; the goal is that a

  Sesto Pusteria, Bolzano, Italy, July 3-6, 2001",,"10.1007/10856495_11",,"astro-ph",,"  Central cool gas component that is often observed from a well-relaxed cluster
system has long been interpreted as a consequence of ``Cooling Flow'' (CF),
radiative cooling followed by inflow of Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM). However,
recent XMM-Newton spectroscopy has shown no signatures of cooler gas phases
below certain temperatures in typical CF clusters (A1795, Tamura et al. 2001;
A1835, Peterson et al. 2001). This contradicts the conventional CF model or at
least requires a major revision of the model. In order to investigate
statistical properties of the central cool component, we performed systematic
analysis of ASCA data on 85 clusters. We found that 1) temperature of the
central cool component strongly depends on the temperature of the main ICM, 2)
the cool component is selectively found around a brightest cluster galaxy (BCG)
that coincide with the X-ray peak position, and 3) the luminosity-temperature
(L-T) relation of the cool component shows nice agreement with the L-T relation
of the main ICM. Together with the previous observational fact that, in some of
the ``CF'' clusters, the total gravitating mass is clustering in two distinct
spatial scales, a main cluster component and a second small-scale system, we
conclude that the central cool component is associated with the second
small-scale self-gravitating system that is immersed in the host cluster, and
the cool component temperature reflects the gravitational potential depth.

during the CORALS survey for absorbers in a radio-selected QSO sample. On the
assumption that z_abs ~ z_em DLAs are neither ejecta from the QSO, nor part of
the host galaxy itself, we use the number density statistics of these DLAs to
investigate galaxy clustering near the QSO redshift. We find that n(z) of z_abs
\~z_em DLAs in our radio-selected QSO sample is ~4 times larger than the number
density of intervening DLAs, implying an excess of galaxies near the QSO. This
result is further supported with the inclusion of the radio-loud QSOs in the
FIRST survey, although the total number of DLAs is still small (4) and the
result is currently only significant at approximately the 2 sigma level. Since
all of the z_abs ~ z_em DLAs we identify in CORALS are found towards optically
bright (B < 20) QSOs, there is no strong evidence (based on these limited
statistics) that this population suffers from a severe dust bias. We compare
our results with those from an optically-selected, radio-quiet QSO sample in
order to determine whether there is evidence for an excess of galaxies around
radio-loud versus radio-quiet QSOs. We find that the n(z) of z_abs ~ z_em DLAs
towards radio-quiet QSOs is in agreement with the number density of intervening
absorbers. This result, although currently limited by the small number
statistics of our survey, supports the conclusion that radio-loud quasars are
found preferentially in rich galaxy environments at high redshift. Finally, we
report that one of the new z_abs ~ z_em DLAs discovered by CORALS has some
residual flux in the base of the Lya trough which may be due to Lya emission,
either from star formation in the DLA galaxy or from gas photoionised by the
QSO.

measured in the spectra of radio-loud quasars drawn from a near-complete,

redshift ranges -- 0.7<z<1.0 and 1.5<z<3.0 -- which were targetted in the UV
with HST/STIS and in the optical with ground-based telescopes, respectively.
First, we corroborate trends for C IV associated absorption to be found
preferentially in steep-spectrum and lobe-dominated quasars, implying the
absorbing material tends to lie away from the radio-jet axis. Furthermore, we
find a clear anticorrelation between C IV absorption strength and the projected
linear size of steep-spectrum quasars, indicative of an evolutionary sequence.
We also find that heavily-absorbed quasars are systematically redder, implying
dust is mixed in with the C IV-absorbing gas. No redshift dependence was found
in any of the trends considered. These new results show that radio sources are
triggered in galaxies which are exceptionally rich in gas and dust, which then
dissipates on a timescale comparable with, but less than, that of the radio
source. This observational sequence, together with the lack of
redshift-dependence, points to a direct causal link between the event which
triggered the radio source and the build-up of absorbing gas and dust, whose
make-up is tantalisingly similar to the products of a post-merger starburst.
Thus, these new results provide direct evidence for the clearing of absorbing
material around quasars with time, as well as the probable association of
starburst activity with the onset of the radio activity in AGN.

divergence-free evolution of vector fields on an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)

significant advance in the divergence-free reconstruction of vector fields. In
that sense, it complements the earlier work of Balsara and Spicer (1999) where
we discussed the divergence-free time-update of vector fields which satisfy
Stoke's law type evolution equations. Our advance in divergence-free
reconstruction of vector fields is such that it reduces to the total variation
diminishing (TVD) property for one-dimensional evolution and yet goes beyond it
in multiple dimensions. Divergence-free restriction is also discussed. An
electric field correction strategy is presented for use on AMR meshes. The
electric field correction strategy helps preserve the divergence-free evolution
of the magnetic field even when the time steps are sub-cycled on refined
meshes. The above-mentioned innovations have been implemented in Balsara's
RIEMANN framework for parallel, self-adaptive computational astrophysics which
supports both non-relativistic and relativistic MHD. Several rigorous, three
dimensional AMR-MHD test problems with strong discontinuities have been run
with the RIEMANN framework showing that the strategy works very well.

attention because of their promise for scalability and their potential for
synergetically utilizing the available resources associated with the existing
infrastructure of the powerful Si technology. Quantitative understanding of and
precise physical control over donor (e.g. Phosphorus) exchange are crucial
elements in the physics underlying the proposed Si-based quantum computer
hardware. An important potential problem in this context is that inter-valley
interference originating from the degeneracy in the Si conduction band edge
causes fast oscillations in donor exchange coupling, which imposes significant
constraints on the Si quantum computer architecture. In this paper we consider
the effect of external strain on Si donor exchange in the context of quantum
computer hardware. We study donor electron exchange in uniaxially strained Si,
since strain partially lifts the valley degeneracy in the bulk. In particular,
we focus on the effects of donor displacements among lattice sites on the
exchange coupling, investigating whether inter-valley interference poses less
of a problem to exchange coupling of donors in strained Si. We show, using the
Kohn-Luttinger envelope function approach, that fast oscillations in exchange
coupling indeed disappear for donor pairs that satisfy certain conditions for
their relative positions, while in other situations the donor exchange coupling
remains oscillatory, with periods close to interatomic spacing. We also comment
on the possible role of controlled external strain in the design and
fabrication of Si quantum computer architecture.

the distance parameters, the values of the electromagnetic field potential at
the horizon and at the symmetry axis. A found solution of this system for the
case of two charged non-rotating black holes shows that in general the total
mass depends on the distance between black holes. Two-Killing reduction

separation of the vibrations induced by bending, shear, twist and extension and
the response to gravitational tidal accelerations can be reliably estimated in

fundamental fact of physics. The so called `natural' units represent the unique
system of units conveniently used in the realm of High Energy Physics. The
system of natural units is defined by the consistent providing of the
adimensional unit value to the velocity c of the eletromagnetic radiation in
the vacuum, related to the Maxwell classical electromagnetic theory and to the
special relativity theory, to the reduced Planck constant
$\hbar\equiv\frac{h}{2\pi}$ having the dimension of action, which is the
fundamental constant of the quantum mechanics as well as to the Boltzmann
constant $k_B$ which has the dimension of heat capacity, being the fundamental
constant associated to the statistical mechanics, $c=\hbar = k_B = 1$. Such
prescription is mandatory as we investigate the ultimate constituents of matter
and their dynamics, since the atoms, leptons and quarks up to the grand
unification, strings, superstrings, and the supergravity theories, as well as
the total unification of the interactions in the M-theory. The one-dimensional
character of this phenomenology is totally featured by the use of the natural
units, reflecting the fact that in order to be possible the investigation of
the fundamental constituents of matter it is being necessary the resolution of
lengths of the order of $10^{-16} cm$ or to reach energies of the order of at
least 1 TeV. The application of this system of natural units results
exceptionally adequate in the description of the Universe since the Planck
scale, up to the Hubble large scale expanding Universe, resulting in the
curious formation of the regular numerical clusters.

basis with which to represent a nearly integrable Hamiltonian. The idea behind
the method is to continuously deform the initial canonical basis in such a way
that the dependence of the Hamiltonian on the canonical position of the final
basis is minimized. The final basis incorporates as much of the classical
dynamics as possible into an integrable Hamiltonian, leaving a much smaller
non-integrable component than in the initial representation. With this approach
it is also possible to construct the semiclassical wavefunctions corresponding
to the final canonical basis. This optimized basis is potentially useful in
quantum calculations, both as a way to minimize the required size of basis
sets, and as a way to provide physical insight by isolating those effects
resulting from integrable dynamics.

been calculated using both the elementary particle model (EPM) approach and the
impulse approximation (IA) approach. Using the EPM approach, the exclusive
statistical radiative muon capture (RMC) rate for photon energy greater than 57
MeV is found to be $0.245 s^{-1}$ and the ordinary muon capture (OMC) rate to
be $1503 s^{-1}$. The IA calculation exhibits a slight dependence on the type
of trinucleon wave functions used. The difference between the IA and EPM
calculation is larger for RMC than for OMC. To resolve the difference between
the two approaches a more detailed investigation including meson exchange
corrections will be required.

  mechanism in gaseous detectors","6 pages, 10 figures, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Nuclear
  Science",,"10.1109/NSSMIC.2001.1008512",,"physics.ins-det physics.med-ph",,"  We have demonstrated experimentally that the main breakdown-triggering
mechanism in most gaseous detectors, including micropattern gaseous detectors,
is sporadic electron jets from the cathode surfaces.
  Depending on conditions, each jet contains randomly from a few primary
electrons up to 10^5, emitted in a time interval ranging between 0.1
microsecond to milliseconds. After the emission, these primary electrons
experience a full gas multiplication in the detector and create spurious
pulses.
  The rate of these jets increases with applied voltage and very sharply at
voltages close to the breakdown limit. We found that these jets are in our
measurements responsible for the breakdown-triggering at any counting rate
between 10^(-2) Hz/mm^2 and 10^8 Hz/mm^2. We demonstrated on a few detectors
that an optimized cathode-geometry, a high electrode surface quality and a
proper choice of the gas mixture, considerably improve the performance
characteristics and provide the highest possible gains.

time dependent Kohn-Sham equation has been developed. Since the effective
Hamiltonian depends on the wave functions, the wave functions and the effective
Hamiltonian should evolve consistently with each other. For this purpose, a
self-consistent loop is required at every time-step for solving the
time-evolution numerically, which is computationally expensive. However, in
this paper, we develop a different approach expressing a formal solution of the
TD-KS equation, and prove that it is possible to solve the TD-KS equation
efficiently and accurately by means of a simple numerical scheme without the
use of any self-consistent loops.

lifted without compromising any of the advantages that it offers. This opens
the door to a wider range of application of the method to physical problems
beyond the restrictive SO(2,1) dynamical symmetry. The numerical scheme
developed to achieve this objective projects the J-matrix formalism in terms of
the eigenvalues of a finite Hamiltonian matrix and its submatrices in any
convenient L2 basis. Numerical stability and convergence of the original
analytic J-matrix method is still maintained in the proposed scheme, which can
be applied to multi-channel nonrelativistic as well as relativistic scattering
problems.
