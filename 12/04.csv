observation of cosmic microwave background anisotropies. In the absence of
beam, the effects of partial coverage and pixelisation are disentangled and
analyzed (using simulations). Then, appropriate maps involving the CMB signal
plus the synchrotron and dust emissions from the Milky Way are simulated, and
an asymmetric beam --which turns following different strategies-- is used to
smooth the simulated maps. An associated circular beam is defined to estimate
the deviations in the angular power spectrum produced by beam asymmetry without
rotation and, afterwards, the deviations due to beam rotation are calculated.
For a certain large coverage, the deviations due to pure asymmetry and
asymmetry plus rotation appear to be very systematic (very similar in each
simulation). Possible applications of the main results of this paper to data
analysis in large coverage experiments --as PLANCK-- are outlined.

image shapes. In order to fit the data successfully, mass substructure has to
be added to the lens, and its level is estimated. To explore expectations about
the level of substructure in galaxies and its influence on strong lensing,
N-body simulation results of a model galaxy are employed. By using the mass
distribution of this model galaxy as a lens, synthetic data sets of different
four image system configurations are generated and simple lens models are again
applied to fit them. The difficulties in fitting these lens systems turn out to
be similar to the case of some real gravitationally lensed systems, thus
possibly providing evidence for the presence and strong influence of

clustering in real space, free from any distortion of the clustering pattern

projected correlation functions of both spectral types are well described by a
power law for transverse separations in the range 2 < (sigma/Mpc/h) < 15, with
a marginally steeper slope for early-types than late-types. Both early and late
types have approximately the same dependence of clustering strength on
luminosity, with the clustering amplitude increasing by a factor of ~2.5
between L* and 4 L*. At all luminosities, however, the correlation function
amplitude for the early-types is ~50% higher than that of the late-types. These
results support the view that luminosity, and not type, is the dominant factor

events and series of spectrally hard states in the X-ray light curves, if the
hard states are longer than ~100s and are ""well separated"" from each other. In
all other cases the source either shows a low-level or a high level radio
emission, but no radio oscillation events. During intervals when the source
stays in the hard spectral state for periods of days to months, the radio
behaviour is quite different; during some of these intervals a quasi-continuous
jet is formed with an almost flat synchrotron spectrum extending to at least
the near-infrared. Based on the similarities between the oscillation profiles
at different wavelengths, we suggest a scenario which can explain most of the
complex X-ray : radio behaviour of GRS 1915+105. We compare this behaviour with
that of other black hole sources and challenge previous reports of a relation

high-redshift objects near the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 that they appear to have
been ejected from the center of the galaxy in at least four similarly
structured triplets. Here some of the consequences of assuming such a local
model for QSOs are examined. From the ages of the ejection events it is found
that in a relatively short time (10 - 100 million years) the intrinsic redshift
component in these objects disappears and their luminosity increases to a value
close to that of a normal galaxy. This period may then determine the
approximate lifetime of a QSO and, in this scenario, QSOs may represent the
first, short-lived stage in the life of a galaxy. It is shown that when QSOs
are assumed to be ""local"", their generation rate is found to be constant
throughout the age of the Universe. There is no need to invoke an epoch of
enhanced, high-luminosity QSO production as is required if their redshifts are
assumed to be purely cosmological. Because QSO lifetimes are relatively short
(less than 100 million yrs), an initial event (Big Bang) may still be required
to explain the high-redshift galaxies whose intrinsic redshift component will
have long since disappeared. The Hubble expansion is therefore still expected
to apply for normal galaxies.

This led to optimistic estimates for the galactic cosmic ray energy achievable

making no strong impact on the shock structure (test particle approach) are
nevertheless scattered by strong self-generated Alfven waves (turbulent boost)
needed to accelerate them quickly. We demonstrate that these two assumptions
are in conflict when applied to SNRs of the age required for cosmic ray
acceleration to the ``knee'' energy.
  We study the combined effect of acceleration nonlinearity (shock modification
by accelerated particles) and wave generation on the acceleration process. We
show that the refraction of self-generated waves resulting from the
deceleration of the plasma flow by the pressure of energetic particles causes
enhanced losses of these particles. This effect slows down the acceleration and
changes the shape of particle spectrum near the cut-off. The implications for

parameterized form (e.g. parabolic fits). Our non-parametric estimate is
practically indistinguishable from the best fit cosmological model, thus
lending independent support to the underlying physics that governs these

extract confidence intervals for the numbers, locations, and heights of peaks
and the successive peak-to-peak height ratios. At the 95%, 68%, and 40%
confidence levels, we find functions that fit the data with one, two, and three
peaks respectively (0 <= l <= 1100). Therefore, the current data prefer two
peaks at the 1 sigma level. However, we also rule out a constant temperature
function at the >8 sigma level. If we assume that there are three peaks in the
data, we find their locations to be within l_1 = (118,300), l_2 = (377,650),

means that either the body is a recent victim of an impact or a tidal
interaction, or is a fragment of a recently disrupted progenitor. Another
factor (relevant for comets) is outgassing. Due to impacts, tidal forces and
outgassing, the asteroidal and cometary precession must be a generic
phenomenon: while some rotators are in the state of visible tumbling, a much
larger amount of objects must be performing narrow-cone precession not so
easily observable from the Earth. The internal dissipation in a freely
precessing top leads to relaxation (gradual damping of the precession) and
sometimes to spontaneous changes in the rotation axis. Recently developed
theory of dissipative precession of a rigid body reveals that this is a highly
nonlinear process: while the body is precessing at an angular rate $ \omega$,
the precession-caused stresses and strains in the body contain components
oscillating at other frequencies. Dependent upon the spin state, those
frequencies may be higher or, most remarkably, lower than the precession rate.
In many states dissipation at the harmonics is comparable to or even exceeds
that at the principal frequency. For this and other reasons, in many spin
states the damping of asteroidal and cometary wobble happens faster, by several
orders, than believed previously. This makes it possible to measure the
precession-damping rate. The narrowing of the precession cone through the
period of about a year can be registered by the currently available

proposed to lie at z>1, and in normally interacting systems with very dusty
environments. We discussed in a previous paper that a population with a fast
evolving infrared burst phase triggered by gas rich mergers at z~1 interpreted
successfully the steep slope of IRAS 60um counts, leaving still a reasonable
CIRB level at this wavelength. To extend the model to mid- and far-IR, we adopt
a template SED as typical for nearby IR bright galaxies, such as Arp220. We
construct the SED for the starburst mergers at z~1 by a simple dust extinction
law and a thermal continuum assumption for the FIR emission. Since the
radiation process at MIR for the merging systems is still uncertain, we assume
it is similar to that of Arp220, but modify it by the observed flux correlation
of ULIGs from IRAS, ISOCAM deep surveys. We show in this paper that the strong
evolution of the ELAIS 90um, ISO 170um and the SCUBA 850um could be
sufficiently accounted for by such an evolutionary scenario, especially for the
hump of the ISOCAM 15um source count around 0.4mJy. From current best fit
results, we find that the dust temperature of those merging system at z~1 would
be higher than that of Arp220 for a reconciliation of the multi-wavelength deep
surveys. The major difference of our current model prediction is that we see a
fast convergence of the differential number counts at 60um below 50mJy, which
is about a factor of two brighter than other model predictions. Future IR
satellite like Astro-F,SIRTF would give strong constraints to the models.

first detection of an H2O maser towards this class of galaxy, they are

is highly redshifted (~ 260-300 km/s) with respect to the adopted systemic
velocity of the galaxy, and we identified no other significant emission at

high-velocity maser emission implies the possible existence of a rotating maser
disk formed in the merging process. The large maser luminosity (~ 40 Lo)
suggests that an active galactic nucleus could be the energy source that gives
rise to the water emission. Alternatively, the maser emission could be
associated with the previously observed double radio source in the centre of

dust distributed in the hot X-ray emitting intracluster medium. The absence of
any signature for intracluster dust in five clusters and the rather low

responsible for the excess X-ray absorption seen in cooling flow clusters.
These observations thereby represent a further unsuccessful attempt in
detecting the presumed final stage of the cooling flow material, in accord with
quite a number of previous studies in other wavelengths regions. Finally, the
observed dimming of the high-redshift supernovae is unlikely be attributable to
extinction caused by dust in the intracluster or even a presumed intercluster

(ZAHB). Current baryon density estimates based on CMB measurements cover a wide
range values $0.009\la \Omega_bh^2 \la 0.045$, that according to Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis (BBN) models would imply $0.24\la Y_P \la 0.26$. We constructed
several sets of evolutionary tracks and HB models by adopting $Y_P=0.26$ and
several metal contents. The comparison between theory and observations suggests
that ZAHB magnitudes based on He-enhanced models are 1.5$\sigma$ brighter than
the empirical ones. The same outcome applies for the TRGB bolometric
magnitudes. This finding somewhat supports a $Y_P$ abundance close to the
canonical 0.23-0.24 value. More quantitative constraints on this parameter are
hampered by the fact that the CMB pattern shows a sizable dependence on both
$Y_P$ and the baryon density only at small angular scales, i.e. at high l in
the power spectrum ($l\ga 100$). However, this region of the power spectrum
could be still affected by deceptive systematic uncertainties. Finally, we
suggest to use the {\em UV-upturn} to estimate the He content on Gpc scales. In
fact, we find that a strong increase in $Y_P$ causes in metal-poor, hot HB
structures a decrease in the UV emission.

flux over the wavelength range from 8450 to 8710 A. We set an improved limit on
the drop of the flux level blueward of the Ly alpha line: a factor of
  > 200. Below 8450 A the spectrum shows a rise in flux, with a large fraction
(> 60 %) of the total emission produced by few narrow features of transmitted
flux. We discuss the obvious proximity effect around this quasar, with the
presence of transmitted flux with many absorption features in a region of about
23h^{-1} comoving Mpc. If assuming the surrounding medium were completely
neutral, the size of this region would imply a quasar lifetime of \~1.3x10^7

  We also present near-IR spectroscopy of both SDSS J1030+0524 and of SDSS

measurements of the CIV line and limits on the HeII emission with the NV line
measurements from the optical spectra to derive line ratios, and by implication
the abundances of these early quasar environments. The results are
indistinguishable from those of lower redshift quasars and indicate little or
no evolution in the abundances from z ~ 6 to z ~ 2. The line ratios suggest
supersolar metallicities, implying that the first stars around the quasars must
have formed at least a few hundreds of Myrs prior to the observation, i.e. at

ferromagnet/superconductor/ferromagnet (F/S/F) nanostructures where S is s-wave
low-T_c superconductor and F's are layers of 3d transition ferromagnetic metal.
Our approach is based on the solution of Gor'kov equations for the normal and
anomalous Green's functions together with a self-consistent evaluation of the
superconducting order parameter. We take into account the elastic
spin-conserving scattering of the electrons assuming s-wave scattering in the S
layer and s-d scattering in the F layers. In accordance with the previous
quasiclassical theories, we found that due to exchange field in the ferromagnet
the anomalous Green's function F(z) exhibits the damping oscillations in the
F-layer as a function of distance z from the S/F interface. In the given model
a half of period of oscillations is determined by the length \xi_m^0 = \pi
v_F/E_ex, where v_F is the Fermi velocity and E_ex is the exchange field, while
damping is governed by the length l_0 = (1/l_{\uparrow} +
1/l_{\downarrow})^{-1} with l_{\uparrow} and l_{\downarrow} being
spin-dependent mean free paths in the ferromagnet. The superconducting
transition temperature T_c(d_F) of the F/S/F trilayer shows the damping
oscillations as a function of the F-layer thickness d_F with period \xi_F =
\pi/\sqrt{m E_ex}, where m is the effective electron mass. We show that strong
spin-conserving scattering either in the superconductor or in the ferromagnet
significantly suppresses these oscillations. The calculated T_c(d_F)
dependences are compared with existing experimental data for Fe/Nb/Fe trilayers
and Nb/Co multilayers.

  Abstract
  The number of times, a scientist is cited in other scientific publications is
now an important factor in his merit consideration. Normally citation indices
of highly cited scientists are available, which in turn give information only
about the dynamics of the citation mechanism of this group. In the present
work, we studied the statistical distribution of the citation index of
Brazilian scientists working in diverse areas, through Zipf-plot technique. As
it is a small sub-group within the scientific community, it can better explain
the dynamics of citation index. We find that gradually truncated power law
distribution can explain well citation index. The distribution of citation of
most cited physicist can also be well explained.
  We develop a model of citation, based on positive feedback, i.e. highly cited
scientist, would get better financial help, and more students, which in turn
help to form a large group working in the same topic and paper is cited more
times. The limiting factor comes because of limited number of articles which
can be published in a particular sub-area due to limited number of scientific
journal, where the article can be cited.

two-loop level for arbitrary on-shell/on-resonance particles in the Standard
Model. The associated Sudakov form factors apply in a universal way to
arbitrary non-mass-suppressed electroweak processes at high energies, although
this universality has to be interpreted with care. The actual calculation is
performed in the temporal Coulomb gauge, where the relevant contributions from
collinear-soft gauge-boson exchange are contained exclusively in the
self-energies of the external on-shell/on-resonance particles. In view of the
special status of the time-like components in this gauge, a careful analysis of
the asymptotic states of the theory is required. From this analysis we derive
an all-order version of the Goldstone-boson Equivalence Theorem without the
need for finite compensation factors. By exploiting conditions obtained from
non-renormalization requirements, which are a consequence of our choice of
gauge, we show that the Sudakov corrections can be extracted through a
combination of energy derivatives and projections by means of external sources.
We observe that the Standard Model behaves dynamically like an unbroken theory
in the Sudakov limit, in spite of the fact that the explicit particle masses
are needed at the kinematical (phase-space) level while calculating the Sudakov
form factors.

output, R parity breaking terms only appear at a non-renormalizable level and
linked to the Yukawa couplings, giving rise to the possibility of having an

(which is related to the light quark mass) is much larger than its physical
value. Naive linear chiral extrapolations of the lattice data to the physical
mass of the pion lead to hyperfine splittings which are smaller than
experimental data. In order to extrapolate these lattice data to the physical
mass of the pion more reasonably, we apply the effective chiral perturbation
theory for heavy mesons, which is invariant under chiral symmetry when the
light quark masses go to zero and heavy quark symmetry when the heavy quark
masses go to infinity. This leads to a phenomenological functional form with
three parameters to extrapolate the lattice data. It is found that the
extrapolated hyperfine splittings are even smaller than those obtained using

neutrinos up to a mass $m_{N}\leq 2$ -- 5 TeV in the dilepton channels

formalism for spin-0 and spin-1 two-fermion systems is analyzed. It is shown
that in the limit q+ = 0 the form factors for both spin-0 and spin-1 systems
can be uniquely determined using only the good amplitudes, which are not
affected by spurious effects related to the loss of rotational covariance
present in the light-front formalism. At the same time, the unique feature of
the suppression of the pair creation process is maintained. Therefore, a
physically meaningful one-body approximation, in which all the constituents are
on their mass-shells, can be consistently formulated in the limit q+ = 0.
Moreover, it is shown that the effects of the contact term arising from the
instantaneous propagation of the active constituent can be canceled out from
the triangle diagram by means of an appropriate choice of the off-shell
behavior of the bound state vertexes; this implies that in case of good
amplitudes the Feynman triangle diagram and the one-body light-front result
match exactly. The application of our covariant light-front approach to the
evaluation of the rho-meson elastic form factors is presented.

octet non-perturbative gluer. We think the IP is composed from the conjugated
pair of such gluer. In the circle of non-perturbative fundamental entities in
QCD, we argue that there should exist a new member -- the constituent gluon, it
should be emerged in high energy $h-h'$ strong-soft processes, and the
glueballs are produced via two constituent gluons fusion. Finally, we
conjecture there may be an averaged dual relation between the glueballs and the

Hilbert space X can be uniformly approximated by smooth functions with no
critical points. This kind of result can be regarded as a sort of very strong
approximate version of the Morse-Sard theorem. Some consequences of the main
theorem are as follows. Every two disjoint closed subsets of X can be separated
by a one-codimensional smooth manifold which is a level set of a smooth
function with no critical points; this fact may be viewed as a nonlinear
analogue of the geometrical version of the Hahn-Banach theorem. In particular,
every closed set in X can be uniformly approximated by open sets whose
boundaries are smooth one-codimensional submanifolds of X. Finally, since every
Hilbert manifold is diffeomorphic to an open subset of the Hilbert space, all
of these results still hold if one replaces the Hilbert space X with any smooth
manifold M modelled on X.

transport RQMD and hydrodynamic models. An attention is paid to the relative
space-time asymmetries in the production of different particle species,
measured as a ratio of the correlation functions corresponding to different
directional selections of the relative momentum vector. Being sensitive to the
relative time delays and to the intensity of collective flows, these
asymmetries can become a promising tool in a study of the deconfinement
transition and the formation of quark-gluon plasma.

consistently included in the particle-hole and particle-particle channels and
treated in Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation. The similarities and
differences in the treatment of even-even and odd-A nuclei are stressed.
Comparison to available experimental information is done for Gamow-Teller
strength distributions, summed strengths, and half-lives. The dependence of
these observables on deformation is particularly emphasized in a search for
signatures of the shape of the parent nucleus.

to directly apply powerful methods of classical mechanics (e.g. KAM methods) to
study the quantum system. Following such an approach, we draw conclusions of
relevance for ``quantum chaos'' when the external background is periodic or
quasi-periodic in time.

in an entangled system of multilevel atoms. The Fourier transform occurs
naturally in the unitary time evolution of energy eigenstates and is used to
define an alternate wave-packet basis for quantum information in the atom. A
change of basis from energy levels to wave packets amounts to a discrete
quantum Fourier transform within each atom. The algorithm then reduces to a
series of conditional phase transforms between two entangled atoms in mixed
energy and wave-packet bases. We show how to implement such transforms using
wave-packet control of the internal states of the ions in the linear ion-trap
scheme for quantum computing.
