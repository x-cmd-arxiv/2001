clusters of galaxies in multi-color optical imaging surveys. This method uses
simple color cuts, combined with a density enhancement algorithm, to up-weight
pairs of galaxies that are close in both angular separation and color. The
method is semi-parametric since it uses minimal assumptions about cluster
properties in order to minimize possible biases. No assumptions are made about
the shape of clusters, their radial profile or their luminosity function. The
method is successful in finding systems ranging from poor to rich clusters of
galaxies, of both regular and irregular shape. We determine the selection
function of the CE method via extensive Monte Carlo simulations which use both
the real, observed background of galaxies and a randomized background of
galaxies. We use position shuffled and color shuffled data to perform the false
positive test. We have also visually checked all the clusters detected by the
CE method. We apply the CE method to the 350 deg^2 of the SDSS (Sloan Digital
Sky Survey) commissioning data and construct a SDSS CE galaxy cluster catalog
with an estimated redshift and richness for each cluster. The CE method is
compared with other cluster selection methods used on SDSS data such as the
Matched Filter (Postman et al. 1996, Kim et al. 2001), maxBCG technique (Annis
et al. 2001) and Voronoi Tessellation (Kim et al. 2001). The CE method can be
adopted for cluster selection in any multi-color imaging surveys.

orbital phase using the High-Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS)

first observation, and it was in a low-flux state during a dip for the second.
Spectra from both flux states show clear P Cygni lines, predominantly from
H-like and He-like ion species. These indicate the presence of a high-velocity
outflow from the Cir X-1 system which we interpret as an equatorial
accretion-disk wind, and from the blueshifted resonance absorption lines we
determine outflow velocities of 200 - 1900 km/s with no clear velocity
differences between the two flux states. The line strengths and profiles,
however, are strongly variable both between the two observations as well as
within the individual observations. We characterize this variability and
suggest that it is due to both changes in the amount of absorbing material
along the line of sight as well as changes in the ionization level of the wind.
We also refine constraints on the accretion-disk wind model using improved
plasma diagnostics such as the He-like Mg XI triplet, and we consider the
possibility that the X-ray absorption features seen from superluminal jet
sources can generally be explained via high-velocity outflows.

with the superposition of an absorbed disk black body, an iron line plus a high
energy component, modelled with either a power law or a Comptonisation tail.
The source showed pronounced spectral variability between our five
observations. While the soft component in the spectrum remained almost
unchanged throughout our campaign, we detected a hard spectral tail which
extended to 200 keV in the first two observations, but became barely detectable
up to 50 keV in the following two. A further re-hardening is observed in the
final observation. The transition from a hard to a soft and then back to a hard
state occurred around an unabsorbed 0.1-200 keV luminosity of 10^38 erg/s (at
10 kpc). This indicates that state transitions in XTE 2012+281 are probably not

units of star formation, are systematically differentiated in their chemical
composition. Molecules including CO and CS almost vanish near the core centers,
where the abundance decreases by one or two orders of magnitude. At the same
time, N2H+ has a constant abundance, and the fraction of NH3 increases toward
the core center. Our conclusions are based on a study of 5 mostly-round
starless cores (L1498, L1495, L1400K, L1517B, and L1544), which we have
mappedin C18O(1-0), C17O(1-0), CS(2-1), C34S(2-1), N2H+(1-0), NH3(1,1) and
(2,2), and the 1.2 mm continuum. For each core we have built a model that fits
simultaneously the radial profile of all observed emission and the central
spectrum for the molecular lines. The observed abundance drops of CO and CS are
naturally explained by the depletion of these molecules onto dust grains at
densities of 2-6 10^4 cm-3. N2H+ seems unaffected by this process up to
densities of several 10^5, while the NH3 abundance may be enhanced by reactions
triggered by the disappearance of CO from the gas phase. With the help of our
models, we show that chemical differentiation automatically explains the
discrepancy between the sizes of CS and NH3 maps, a problem which has remained
unexplained for more than a decade. Our models, in addition, show that a
combination of radiative transfer effects can give rise to the previously
observed discrepancy in the linewidth of these two tracers. Although this
discrepancy has been traditionally interpreted as resulting from a systematic
increase of the turbulent linewidth with radius, our models show that it can
arise in conditions of constant gas turbulence.

high kinetic temperature for the gas (70 K), and a high column density (10^{24}

unreasonably large rotational velocities. While this problem is mitigated by

are much more difficult to analyze than Gaussian primary anisotropies for which
the procedures are reasonably well developed. Historical forecasts for what CMB
experiments might see used semi-analytic tools, including large scale map
constructions, with localized and simplified pressure structures distributed on
a point process of (clustered) sources. Hydro studies beyond individual
cluster/supercluster systems were inadequate, but now large-volume simulations
with high resolution are beginning to shift the balance. We illustrate this by
applying ``Gasoline'' (parallelized Tree+SPH) computations to construct SZ maps
and derive statistical measures. We believe rapid Monte Carlo simulations using
parameterized templates centered on point processes informed by optical and
other means on the observational side, and by hydro simulations on the theory
side, should play an important role in pipelines to analyze the new SZ field
data. We show that localized sources should dominate upcoming SZ experiments,
identify sources in the maps under filtering and noise levels expected for

redshift localization, and discuss whether cosmic web patterns such as
superclusters can be enhanced when such extra source information is supplied.

interstellar H-Alpha emission toward the high Galactic latitude O star HD 93521
(l = 183.1, b = +62.2). Three emission components were detected having radial
velocities of -10 km s^{-1}, -51 km s^{-1}, and -90 km s^{-1} with respect to
the local standard of rest (LSR) and H-Alpha intensities of 0.20 R, 0.15 R, and
0.023 R, respectively, corresponding to emission measures of 0.55 cm^{-6} pc,
0.42 cm^{-6} pc, and 0.06 cm^{-6} pc. We have also detected an H-Alpha emission
component at -1 km s^{-1} (LSR) with an intensity of 0.20 R (0.55 cm^{-6} pc)
toward the direction l = 148.5, b = +53.0, which lies in the region of
exceptionally low H I column density known as the Lockman Window. In addition,
we studied the direction l = 163.5, b = +53.5. Upper limits on the possible
intensity of Galactic emission toward this direction are 0.11 R at the LSR and
0.06 R at -50 km s^{-1}. We also detected and characterized twelve faint
(~0.03-0.15 R), unidentified atmospheric lines present in WHAM H-Alpha spectra.
Lastly, we have used WHAM to obtain [O I] 6300 spectra along the line of sight
toward HD 93521. We place an upper limit of 0.060 R on the [O I] intensity of
the -51 km s^{-1} component. If the temperature of the gas is 10,000 K within
the H-Alpha emitting region, the hydrogen ionization fraction n(H+)/n(H_total)

by new ambitious attacks on other cluster-system observables discussed at TAW8:
X-ray, optical, weak lensing. Interpreting the mix is complicated by such
issues as entropy injection, inhomogeneity, non-sphericity, non-equilibrium,
and these effects must be sorted out for the cluster system to contribute to
``high precision cosmology'', especially the quintessential physics of the dark
energy that adds further mystery to a dark matter dominated Universe. We will
have to address ``Is it cluster evolution or is it cosmology?''. The answer
will be both, but we can be optimistic that, with the huge data influx,
computational power increase, and talented people joining the adventure, we can
handle both observationally, theoretically and phenomenologically.

technique, can teach us about how galaxies form and evolve. The stellar masses
and other properties of such Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) depend sensitively on
the details of star formation. In this paper we consider three different star
formation prescriptions, and use semi-analytic methods applied to the
now-standard $\Lambda$CDM theory of hierarchical structure formation to show
how these assumptions about star formation affect the predicted masses of the
stars in these galaxies and the masses of the dark matter halos that host them.
We find that, within the rather large uncertainties, recent estimates of the
stellar masses of LBGs from multi-color photometry are consistent with the
predictions of all three models. However, the estimated stellar masses are more
consistent with the predictions of two of the models in which star formation is
accelerated at high redshifts $z\gsim3$, and of these models the one in which
many of the LBGs are merger-driven starbursts is also more consistent with
indications that many high redshift galaxies are gas rich. The clustering
properties of LBGs have put some constraints on the masses of their host halos,
but due to similarities in the halo occupation of the three models we consider
and degeneracies between model parameters, current constraints are not yet
sufficient to distinguish between realistic models.

significant dissipation can take place both inside and outside the photosphere

with radius. With an analytic model we show how the efficiency of this process

non-thermal excitation was taking place, driven increasingly by the decay of

supporting scenarios where fast radioactive nickel is created and ejected just

token-base-retain the original semantic information, good time complex-O(nm)
(for worst, average and best case) and good experimental performance make it a
milestone paper in this area. Further study indicates that there is still room
for improvement of its Field Similarity algorithm. Our paper is to introduce a
package of substring-based new algorithms to determine Field Similarity.
Combined together, our new algorithms not only achieve higher accuracy but also
gain the time complexity O(knm) (k<0.75) for worst case, O(*n) where <6 for
average case and O(1) for best case. Throughout the paper, we use the approach
of comparative examples to show higher accuracy of our algorithms compared to
the one proposed in [LL+99]. Theoretical analysis, concrete examples and
experimental result show that our algorithms can significantly improve the
accuracy and time complexity of the calculation of Field Similarity. [US97] D.

masses, which are found to be crucial for the large solar neutrino mixing. In
an extended version of the Zee model with an extra triplet Higgs scalar (s),
neutrino oscillations are described by three steps: 1) the maximal atmospheric
mixing is induced by democratic mass terms supplied by $s$ with $X$=2 that can
initiate the type II seesaw mechanism for the smallness of these masses; 2) the
maximal solar neutrino mixing is triggered by the creation of radiative masses
by $h^+$ with $X$ = 0; 3) the large solar neutrino mixing is finally induced by
a $\nu_\mu$-$\nu_\tau$ mixing arising from the rotation of the radiative mass
terms as a result of the diagonalization that converts $e$-$\mu$ and $e$-$\tau$
mixing masses into the electron mass.

framework of a neutrino factory. We introduce three quantities, which are good
discriminants for a non vanishing complex phase ($\delta$) in the $3\times 3$
neutrino mixing matrix. We find that these three discriminants (in vacuum) all
scale with $L/E_{\nu}$. Matter effects modify the scaling, but these effects
are large enough to spoil the sensitivity only for baselines larger than 5000
km. So, in the hypothesis of constant neutrino factory power, the sensitivity
on the $\delta$-phase is independent of the baseline chosen. Specially
interesting is the direct measurement of T-violation from the ``wrong-sign''
electron channel, which involves a comparison of the $\nue\ra\numu$ and
$\numu\ra\nue$ oscillation rates. However, the $\numu\ra\nue$ measurement
requires magnetic discrimination of the electron charge, experimentally very
challenging in a neutrino detector: low-energy neutrino beams and hence short
baselines, are preferred. In this paper we show the exclusion regions in the
$\Delta m^2_{12} - \delta$ plane for two concrete cases. We obtain a similar
excluded region provided that the electron detection efficiency is $\sim$20%
and the charge confusion 0.1%. The $\Delta m^2_{12}$ compatible with the LMA
solar data can be tested with a flux of 5$\times 10^{21}$ muons. We compare

action is the unique deformation which admits solutions of this type. By
applying the method to the non-abelian case we calculated the full effective
action through O(\alpha'^3). The presence of derivative terms turns out to be
essential. Testing the result by comparing the spectrum in the presence of a
constant magnetic background field with the string theory prediction, we obtain
perfect agreement.

  Proceedings,Rome, July, 2000",,"10.1142/9789812777386_0117",,"math-ph math.MP",,"  It is known that in the four-dimensional Riemannian space the complex
bispinor generates a number of tensors: scalar, pseudo-scalar, vector,
pseudo-vector, antisymmetric tensor. This paper solves the inverse problem: the
above tensors are arbitrarily given, it is necessary to find a bispinor
(bispinors) reproducing the tensors. The algorithm for this mapping constitutes
construction of Hermitean matrix $M$ from the tensors and finding its
eigenvalue spectrum. A solution to the inverse problem exists only when $M$ is
nonnegatively definite. Under this condition a matrix $Z$ satisfying equation
$M=ZZ^{+}$ can be found. One and the same system of tensor values can be used
to construct the matrix $Z$ accurate to an arbitrary factor on the left-hand
side, viz. unitary matrix $U$ in polar expansion $Z=HU$. The matrix $Z$ is
shown to be expandable to a set of bispinors, for which the unitary matrix $U$
is responsible for the internal (gauge) degrees of freedom. Thus, a group of
gauge transformations depends only on the Riemannian space dimension,
signature, and the number field used. The constructed algorithm for mapping
tensors to bispinors admits extension to Riemannian spaces of a higher
dimension.

equivalently by Chern classes of coherent sheaves. On a compact Kaehler
manifold, Hodge conjecture is known to be false if algebraic subsets are

Kaehler manifold, Hodge classes are generated by Chern classes of coherent
sheaves. We also show that finite free resolution do not in general exist for
coherent sheaves on compact Kaehler manifolds.

and momentum operators are reviewed. The tomographic probability distributions
(tomograms) for the Fock states and Gaussian states of the quadratic systems
are discussed. The tomograms for the Fock states are expressed in terms of
multivariable Hermite polynomials. Using the obvious physical relations some
new formulas for multivariable Hermite polynomials are found. Examples of
oscillator and charge moving in electromagnetic field are presented.

side result, the proof of the irreversibility in asymptotic local manipulations
of entanglement is extended to two-qubit systems.

simulates the dynamical evolution in the regime of quantum chaos. Even if the
quantum algorithm is polynomial in number of qubits $n_q$, it is shown that the
ideal eigenstates become mixed and strongly modified by static imperfections
above a certain threshold which drops exponentially with $n_q$. Above this
threshold the quantum eigenstate entropy grows linearly with $n_q$ but the
computation remains reliable during a time scale which is polynomial in the
imperfection strength and in $n_q$.

is shown to belong to $BPP^C$ and $BQP^C$ (depending on the ability of the
oracle C to clone either a binary random variable or a qubit). The same result
is extended in the case of an approximate cloning oracle, thus establishing
that $NP \subseteq BPP^C \subseteq BQP^C$ and $NP \subseteq BPP^{AC} \subseteq
BQP^{AC}$, where C and AC are the exact and approximate cloning oracles,
respectively. Although exact cloning is impossible in quantum systems,
approximate cloning remains a possibility. However, the best known methods for
approximate cloning (based on unitary evolution) do not currently achieve the
desired precision levels. And it remains an open question whether they could be
improved when non-linear (or non-unitary) operators are used. Finally, a
straightforward attempt to dispense with cloning, replacing it by unitary
evolution, is proved to be impossible.

`perspectival' (`relational', `relative state') version of the modal
interpretation of quantum mechanics. We show that if we assume certain features
of discreteness and determinism in the operation of the measuring device (which
could be a part of the observer's nerve system), this gives rise to classical
characteristics of the observed properties, in the first place to spatial
localization. We investigate to what extent semi-classical behavior of the
object system itself (as opposed to the observational system) is needed for the
emergence of classicality. Decoherence is an essential element in the mechanism
of observation that we assume, but it turns out that in our approach no
environment-induced decoherence on the level of the object system is required
for the emergence of classical properties.
