the low-energy levels oscillate with a frequency proportional to the number of

results from applications to glueballs. After quarks are added, the Hamiltonian

Lorentz and chiral symmetry are not sufficient to accurately determine all

enough to fix all parameters unambiguously. Applications to light-light and

expected and the measured neutrino fluxes, we set a limit $g_{a\gamma \gamma} <
4.0\times 10^{-10} ~\mathrm{GeV} ^{-1}$. This limit based on a new procedure is
about a factor of 3 improvement over the previous theoretical limit and a more
severe limit than the solar axion experiments. Therefore this limit is the most
stringent limit on solar axions.

moduli space of N=(4,4) superconformal field theories with central charge c=6.
Part of this note consists of a summary of our earlier results on the location
of these theories within the moduli space [NW01,Wen] and the action of a
specific version of mirror symmetry on them [NW]. We argue that these results
allow for a direct translation from geometric to conformal field theoretic
data. Additionally, this work contains a detailed discussion of an example
which allows the application of various versions of mirror symmetry on K3. We
show that all of them agree in that point of the moduli space.

Logarithmic conformal field theories. In particular we draw attention to the
fundamental differences between theories with zero and non-zero central charge.
However they are both characterised by at least two independent parameters. We
show how, by using a generalised Sugawara construction, one can calculate the
logarithmic partner of T. We show that such a construction works in the c=-2
theory using the conformal dimension one primary currents which generate a
logarithmic extension of the Kac-Moody algebra.

of the Picard numbers of X and D. Moreover, if $\rho_X-\rho_D>0$ (with some
additional hypotheses if $\rho_X-\rho_D=1$), we give an explicit birational
description of X. Using this result, we show that when dim X=5, we have
$\rho_X\leq 9$.
  In the second part of the paper, we study equivariant birational morphisms f
whose source is Fano. We give some general results, and in dimension 4 we show
that f is always a composite of smooth equivariant blow-ups. Finally, we study
under which hypotheses a non-projective toric variety can become Fano after a
smooth equivariant blow-up.

the wave function or the results of measurements exist, and to answer the

rather formidable task. However, this is not the case for Bohmian mechanics,
which, like classical mechanics, is a theory about real objects. In Bohmian
terms, the problem of the classical limit becomes very simple: when do the
Bohmian trajectories look Newtonian?

corresponds to the well-known Peres-Horodecki positive partial transpose (PPT)
criterion, and the more complicated tests are strictly stronger. The new
criteria are tractable due to powerful computational and theoretical methods
for the class of convex optimization problems known as semidefinite programs.
We successfully applied the results to many low-dimensional states from the
literature where the PPT test fails. As a byproduct of the criteria, we provide
an explicit construction of the corresponding entanglement witnesses.
