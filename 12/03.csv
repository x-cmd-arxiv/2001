we compare spectral fits of the averaged pulsar wind nebulae (PWN) emission to
that of the central core using an absorbed power-law model. These results
suggest an empirical relationship between the bulk averaged photon indicies

The photon indices of PWNe are found to fall in the range of 1.3 < Gamma_PWN <

pulsars observed herein seem to indicate consistent emission mechanisms common
to all young pulsars. We point out that the previous spectral results obtained

the initial LeBlanc-Wilson jet and a subsequent protopulsar or toroidal jet
that propagates at about the core escape velocity. The jets will produce bow
shocks that tend to expel matter, including iron and silicon, into equatorial
tori, accounting for observations of the element distribution in Cas A. A
magnetic ``switch'' mechanism may apply in instances of low density and large
magnetic field with subsequent increase in the speed and collimation of the
toroidal jet, depositing relatively little momentum. The result could be enough
infall to form a black hole with a third, highly relativistic jet that could
catch up to the protopulsar jet after it has emerged from the star. The
interaction of these two jets could generate internal shocks and explain the
presence of iron lines in the afterglow. Recent estimates that typical
gamma-ray burst energy is about 3x10^50 erg imply either a very low efficiency
for conversion of rotation into jets, or a rather rapid turnoff of the jet
process even though the black hole still rotates rapidly. Magnetars and
``hypernovae'' might arise in an intermediate parameter regime of energetic
jets that yield larger magnetic fields and provide more energy than the routine

of two-component (stars and dark matter) spherical systems with different
velocity distributions. We compare the predicted velocity dispersion profiles
to observations in the case of Fornax and Draco dwarfs. For isotropic models
the dark haloes with cores are found to fit the data better than those with
cusps. Anisotropic models are studied by fitting two parameters, dark mass and
velocity anisotropy, to the data. In this case all profiles yield good fits but
the steeper the cusp of the profile, the more tangential is the velocity
distribution required to fit the data. To resolve this well-known degeneracy of
density profile versus velocity anisotropy we obtain predictions for the
kurtosis of the line-of-sight velocity distribution for models found to provide
best fits to the velocity dispersion profiles. It turns out that profiles with
cores typically yield higher values of kurtosis which decrease more steeply
with distance than the cuspy profiles, which will allow to discriminate between
the profiles once the kurtosis measurements become available. We also show that
with present quality of the data the alternative explanation of velocity
dispersions in terms of Modified Newtonian Dynamics cannot yet be ruled out.

to the all-time maximum and minimum X-ray flux states, respectively. We find
the variations in the observed flux and spectra at these epochs to be
consistent with a constant column density of line-of-sight material reacting to
changes in the ionizing continuum. The data from the two epochs are consistent
with a simple decrease (by a factor 8-10) in the luminosity of a constant
0.5-50 keV slope source and a line-of-sight absorber with an equivalent
hydrogen column density of 10^21.9 cm^-2. Intermediate luminosities, sampled
during other ASCA observations, are all fitted by the same model with a very
small change in spectral index (well below \Delta\Gamma=0.2). In addition,
analysis of the long (360 ks) ASCA observation in 1998 shows clear ""color""
variations that are entirely consistent with this model and are interpreted as
due to changes in the opacity of the absorbing gas. The data allow us to put a
conservative upper limit of 60 ks on the recombination time which translates to
a lower limit of about 2.4 times 10^6 cm^-3 on the density of the recombining
gas and an upper limit of about 6 times 10^17 h_{75}^-2 cm on its distance from

dragging of reference frames were shown to be present. Through a number of
calculations we have investigated the evolution of the magnetic field with
different rates of stellar rotation, different inclination angles between the
magnetic moment and the rotation axis, as well as different values of the
electrical conductivity. All of these calculations have been performed for a
constant temperature relativistic polytropic star and make use of a consistent
solution of the initial value problem which avoids the use of artificial
analytic functions. Our results show that there exist general relativistic
effects introduced by the rotation of the spacetime which tend to decrease the
decay rate of the magnetic field. The rotation-induced corrections are however
generally hidden by the high electrical conductivity of the neutron star matter

shaped area (""bulge"") of 11x16 arcsec or 450x650 pc around the nucleus,
dominated by a smooth population of old stars with overimposed dust lanes. We
found 30 bright point-like sources in the bulge of M51; many of these are
bright in the UV. They are located in elongated ""strings"" which follow the
general pattern of the dust lanes. The spectral energy distributions of the
pointsources are compared with those of clusters or single stars. We present
arguments that the pointsources are isolated massive stars or small groups of a
few massive stars. The energy distributions are best fitted with those of
single stars with 4000<Teff<50000 K, 4.2<log L/Lsun<7.2, and 12<Mstar<200 Msun.
We have derived upper limits to the total mass of low mass stars that could be
""hiding"" within the point sources. For the bluest sources the upper limit is
only a few hundred Msun. We conclude that massive stars are formed outside
clusters (or in very low mass clusters) in the bulge of M51. The estimated star
formation rate in the bulge is 1 to 2x10^(-3) Msun/yr. This star formation rate
could be sustained for about 200 to 400 Myrs, suggesting that the ongoing
massive star formation in the bulge of M51 is fed/triggered by the interaction
with its companion about 400 Mrs ago. Theoretical cloud-models show that CO is
destroyed in low extinction clouds near the bright nucleus of M51, so that H_2,

of massive stars, in agreement with the observations. This mode of massive-star
formation in the bulge of M51 may resemble the star formation in the early
Universe, when the CO and dust contents were low due to the low metallicity.

properties of dirty interfaces (where Schep-Bauer distribution of transmission
eigenvalues is confirmed for single interface, as well as for the stack of such

zero-temperature conductance of a finite-size sample attached to two
semi-infinite ideal leads) is thoroughly reexamined by comparing their answers

distribution is point-like, or granular, and not fluid-like. The basic result
is that the discrete nature of the system is a fundamental ingredient to
understand its evolution. The initial configuration is a Poisson distribution
in which the distribution of forces is governed by the Holtsmark function.

of the granularity from small to large scales. We also present a simple

formulations including the Hamiltonian and Euclidean space Dyson-Schwinger

The breaking of chiral and supersymmetry together with a reduction of gauge
symmetry by introducing D-branes at generic angles into type I or type II

phenomenologically appealing four-dimensional vacua. Examples that come very
close to Standard Model and GUT physics are considered and issues like the
cancellation of anomalies and the emergence of global symmetries studied in
some detail. Concerning the gravitational backreaction, the perturbative
potential generated at the disc level is shown to lead to a run-away
instability of geometric moduli within the purely toroidal compactifications.
It can at least partly be avoided in certain orbifold vacua, where the relevant
moduli are frozen. These more restricted models still possess sufficient

product of commutators. The minimal number of factors in such a product is
called the commutator length of the element. The commutator length of a group
is defined as the supremum of commutator lengths of elements of its commutator
subgroup.
  We show that for certain closed symplectic manifolds, including complex
projective spaces and Grassmannians, the universal cover of the group of
Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms of the manifold has infinite commutator length.
In particular, we present explicit examples of elements in that group that have
arbitrarily large commutator length -- the estimate on their commutator length
depends on the multiplicative structure of the quantum cohomology of the
symplectic manifold. By a different method we also show that in the case when
the first Chern class of the manifold is zero the universal covers of the group
of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms and of the identity component of the group of
all symplectomorphisms both have infinite commutator length.

Our motivation for introducing these new spaces, denoted $\V^{pq}$, is to gain
a more accurate information on (compact) embeddings of Morrey spaces in
appropriate Sobolev spaces. It is here that the secondary parameter q (-- and a
further logarithmic refinement parameter $\alpha$, denoted $\V^{pq}(\log
\V)^{\alpha}$) gives a finer scaling, which allows us to make the subtle
distinctions necessary for embedding in spaces with a fixed order of
smoothness.

separate between $H^{-1}$-compactness and the phenomena of
concentration-cancelation. Expressed in terms of their $\V^{pq}(\log

Euler-Poisson equations -- the so called critical threshold phenomena, where
the answer to questions of global smoothness vs. finite time breakdown depends
on whether the initial configuration crosses an intrinsic, ${O}(1)$ critical
threshold.
  We investigate a class of Euler-Poisson equations, ranging from
one-dimensional problem with or without various forcing mechanisms to
multi-dimensional isotropic models with geometrical symmetry. These models are
shown to admit a critical threshold which is reminiscent of the conditional
breakdown of waves on the beach; only waves above certain initial critical
threshold experience finite-time breakdown, but otherwise they propagate
smoothly. At the same time,the asymptotic long time behavior of the solutions
remains the same, independent of crossing these initial thresholds.
  A case in point is the simple one-dimensional problem where the unforced
inviscid Burgers' solution always forms a shock discontinuity except for the
non-generic case of increasing initial profile, $u_0' \geq 0$. In contrast, we
show that the corresponding one dimensional Euler-Poisson equation with zero
background has global smooth solutions as long as its initial $(\rho_0,u_0)$-
configuration satisfies $u_0'\geq -\sqrt{2k\rho_0}$, allowing a finite,
critical negative velocity gradient. As is typical for such nonlinear
convection problems one is led to a Ricatti equation which is balanced here by
a forcing acting as a 'nonlinear resonance', and which in turn is responsible
for this critical threshold phenomena.

$\partial_t u +u\cdot \nabla u=F$, which shows up in different contexts
dictated by the different modeling of $F$'s. To this end we utilize a basic
description for the spectral dynamics of $\nabla u$, expressed in terms of the
(possibly complex) eigenvalues, $\lambda=\lambda(\nabla u)$, which are shown to
be governed by the Ricatti-like equation $\lambda_t+u\cdot
\nabla\lambda+\lambda^2= < l, \nabla F r>$.
  We address the question of the time regularity of four prototype models
associated with different forcing $F$. Using the spectral dynamics as our
essential tool in these investigations, we obtain a simple form of a critical
threshold for the linear damping model and we identify the 2D vanishing
viscosity limit for the viscous irrotational dusty medium model. Moreover, for
the $n$-dimensional restricted Euler equations we obtain $[n/2]+1$ global
invariants, interesting for their own sake, which enable us to precisely
characterize the local topology at breakdown time, extending previous studies
in the $n=3$-dimensional case. Finally, as a forth model we introduce the
$n$-dimensional restricted Euler-Poisson (REP)system, identifying a set of
$[n/2]$ global invariants, which in turn yield (i) sufficient conditions for
finite time breakdown, and (ii) characterization of a large class of

functions with finitely many jump discontinuities, where $[f](x):=f(x+)-f(x-)
\neq 0$. Our approach is based on two main aspects--localization using
appropriate concentration kernels and separation of scales by nonlinear
enhancement.
  To detect such edges, one employs concentration kernels, $K_\epsilon(\cdot)$,
depending on the small scale $\epsilon$. It is shown that odd kernels, properly
scaled, and admissible (in the sense of having small $W^{-1,\infty}$-moments of
order ${\cal O}(\epsilon)$) satisfy $K_\epsilon*f(x) = [f](x) +{\cal
O}(\epsilon)$, thus recovering both the location and amplitudes of all edges.As
an example we consider general concentration kernels of the form
$K^\sigma_N(t)=\sum\sigma(k/N)\sin kt$ to detect edges from the first
$1/\epsilon=N$ spectral modes of piecewise smooth f's. Here we improve in
generality and simplicity over our previous study in [A. Gelb and E. Tadmor,
Appl. Comput. Harmon. Anal., 7 (1999), pp. 101-135]. Both periodic and
nonperiodic spectral projections are considered. We identify, in particular, a
new family of exponential factors, $\sigma^{exp}(\cdot)$, with superior
localization properties.
  The other aspect of our edge detection involves a nonlinear enhancement
procedure which is based on separation of scales between the edges, where
$K_\epsilon*f(x)\sim [f](x) \neq 0$, and the smooth regions where $K_\epsilon*f
= {\cal O}(\epsilon) \sim 0$. Numerical examples demonstrate that by coupling
concentration kernels with nonlinear enhancement one arrives at effective edge
detectors.

  Data from its Spectral Information",,"Foundations of Computational Mathematics, Online publication
  (2001)",,,"math.NA",,"  We discuss the reconstruction of piecewise smooth data from its (pseudo-)
spectral information. Spectral projections enjoy superior resolution provided
the data is globally smooth, while the presence of jump discontinuities is
responsible for spurious ${\cal O}(1)$ Gibbs oscillations in the neighborhood
of edges and an overall deterioration to the unacceptable first-order
convergence rate. The purpose is to regain the superior accuracy in the
piecewise smooth case, and this is achieved by mollification.
  Here we utilize a modified version of the two-parameter family of spectral
mollifiers introduced by Gottlieb & Tadmor [GoTa85]. The ubiquitous
one-parameter, finite-order mollifiers are based on dilation. In contrast, our
mollifiers achieve their high resolution by an intricate process of high-order
cancelation. To this end, we first implement a localization step using edge
detection procedure, [GeTa00a, GeTa00b]. The accurate recovery of piecewise
smooth data is then carried out in the direction of smoothness away from the
edges, and adaptivity is responsible for the high resolution. The resulting
adaptive mollifier greatly accelerates the convergence rate, recovering
piecewise analytic data within exponential accuracy while removing spurious
oscillations that remained in [GoTa85]. Thus, these adaptive mollifiers offer a
robust, general-purpose ``black box'' procedure for accurate post processing of
piecewise smooth data.

differential equation or, alternatively, as a system of second order
differential equations by describing the evolution of both the center of mass

equations, the Coulomb interaction between two spinning electrons is
considered. We find from the classical viewpoint that these spinning electrons
can form bound states under suitable initial conditions. Since the classical
Coulomb interaction of two spinless point electrons does not allow for the
existence of bound states, it is the spin structure that gives rise to new
