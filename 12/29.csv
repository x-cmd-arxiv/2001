will provide the basis of systematic diagnostics for jets and their related
young stellar objects, to attest the emission mechanisms of such phenomena.
This work can help bring first-principle theoretical predictions to confront
actual multi-wavelength observations, and will bridge the link between many

formation rate (SFR) with look-back time or redshift has two main weaknesses:
1- the large uncertainty of the dust/extinction corrections, and 2- that
systematic errors may be introduced by the fact that the SFR is estimated using
different methods at different redshifts. To assess the possible systematic
differences among the different SFR estimators and the role of dust, we have
compared SFR estimates using H$\alpha$, SFR(H$\alpha$), [OII]$\lambda$3727\AA,
SFR(OII), UV, SFR(UV) and FIR, SFR(FIR) luminosities of a sample comprising the
31 nearby star forming galaxies having high quality photometric data in the UV,
optical and FIR.
  We review the different ""standard"" methods for the estimation of the SFR and
find that while the standard method provides good agreement between
SFR(H$\alpha$) and SFR(FIR), both SFR(OII) and SFR(UV) are systematically
higher than SFR(FIR), irrespective of the extinction law.
  We show that the excess in the SFR(OII) and SFR(UV) is mainly due to an
overestimate of the extinction resulting from the effect of underlying stellar
Balmer absorptions in the measured emission line fluxes. Taking this effect
into consideration in the determination of the extinction brings the SFR(OII)
and SFR(UV) in line with the SFR(FIR) and simultaneously reduces the internal
scatter of the SFR estimations. Based on these results we have derived
""unbiased"" SFR expressions for the SFR(UV), SFR(OII) and SFR(H$\alpha$). We
have used these estimators to recompute the SFR history of the Universe using
the results of published surveys.

X-ray wavelength regimes began only recently, in contrast to optical studies.
This is mainly due to the long timescale on which the radio afterglow emission
decays, and to the intrinsic faintness of radio emission from star-forming
galaxies at z~1, as well as source confusion in sub-mm observations; X-ray
observations of GRB hosts have simply not been attempted yet. Despite these
difficulties, we have recently made the first detections of radio and sub-mm
emission from the host galaxies of GRB980703 and GRB010222, respectively, using
the VLA and the SCUBA instrument on JCMT. In both cases we find that the
inferred star formation rates (~500 solar masses per year) and bolometric
luminosities (~few 10^12 solar luminosities) indicate that these galaxies are
possibly analogous to the local population of Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxies
(ULIRGs) undergoing a starburst. However, there is a modest probability that
the observed emission is due to AGN activity rather than star formation, thus
requiring observations with Chandra or XMM. The sample of GRB hosts offers a
number of unique advantages to the broader question of the evolution of
galaxies and star formation from high redshift to the present time since: (i)
GRBs trace massive stars, (ii) are detectable to high redshifts, and (iii) have
immense dust penetrating power. Therefore, radio/sub-mm/X-ray observations of
GRB hosts can potentially provide crucial information both on the nature of the
GRB host galaxies, and on the history of star formation.

proportionally to the square of the field's initial scale. The latter makes our
mechanism particularly efficient when operating on superhorizon sized magnetic
fields, like those produced during inflation. In that case, the achieved
amplification can easily boost magnetic strengths, which may still lie
relatively close to the galactic dynamo lower limits, well within the currently
accepted range.

hopping $t$ (and thus also $T_c$) due to an elongation of the (in-plane) Mn-O
bond length. In this comment such a general understanding of the strain effects
is disapproved. It is argued that the tensile strain leads primarily to a
larger Mn-O-Mn bond angle (with the Mn-O bond length nearly unchanged), thus
the pure geometric consideration on $t$ is already in the correct direction
towards the experimental findings by Zhang {\it et al.} At the same time, an
indirect strain effect under consideration of the dynamic electron-phonon

example (we leave the cosmological case for future discussion). Starting off
from the field equations of gravity in 5D and some conditions on the metric we
construct a spacetime whose imbedding is a 4D generalization of the
Schwarzchild metric. The external region of the imbedded spacetime is found to
contain two distinct fields. We discuss the properties of the fields and the
potential implications. Taken as they are, the results suggest that the
collapse of matter to form a horizon may have non-local consequences on the
geometry of spacetime. In general, the use of horizon-confined mass as a
coordinate suggests three potential features of our universe. The first is that
the observed 4D spacetime curvature and ordinary matter fields may be hybrid
features of 5D originating from the mixing of coordinates. Secondly, because
the fifth coordinate induces physical fields on the 4D hyperface, the global
metric of the universe may not be asymptotically flat. And finally, associating
matter with an independent dimension points towards a theory of nature that is
scale invariant.

factor at order p^6 of chiral perturbation theory which is the next-to-leading
order correction to the well-known p^4 result achieved by Gasser and Leutwyler.
At order p^6 the chiral expansion contains 1- and 2-loop diagrams which are
discussed in detail. The irreducible 2-loop graphs of the sunset topology are
calculated numerically. In addition, the chiral Lagrangian L^6 produces direct
couplings with the W-bosons. Due to these unknown couplings, one can always add
linear terms in q^2 to the predictions of the form factor f_-(q^2). For the
form factor f_+(q^2), this ambiguity involves even quadratic terms. Making use
of the fact that the pion electromagnetic form factor involves the same q^4
counter term, the q^4-ambiguity can be resolved. Apart from the possibility of
adding an arbitrary linear term in q^2 our calculation shows that chiral
perturbation theory converges very well in this application, as the O(p^6)
corrections are small. Comparing the predictions of chiral perturbation theory
with the recent CPLEAR data, it is seen that the experimental form factor
f_+(q^2) is well described by a linear fit, but that the slope lambda_+ is
smaller by about 2 standard deviations than the O(p^4) prediction. The
unavoidable q^2 counter term of the O(p^6) corrections allows to bring the
predictions of chiral perturbation theory into perfect agreement with
experiment.

quantum state known to and furnished by the acceptor (Bob), rather than Alice.
Classical communication is used to conclude the commitment phase and bind
Alice's subsequent unveiling. Such a class of secure protocols can be built
upon currently proposed QBC schemes impervious to a simple EPR attack. A
specific scheme based on the Brassard-Crepeau-Josza-Langlois protocol is
presented here as an example.

atoms have been diffracted from a 100 nm period silicon nitride transmission
grating and the van der Waals coefficients $C_3$ for the interaction of the
excited atoms with the silicon nitride surface have been determined from the
diffraction intensities out to the 10th order. The results agree with
calculations based on the non-retarded Lifshitz formula.
