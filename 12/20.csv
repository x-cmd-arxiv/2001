selected sources belonging to the HELLAS sample obtained with BeppoSAX down to
a 5-10 keV flux limit of f_{5-10 keV}~3x10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1. The sample
consists of 118 sources. 25 sources have been identified trough correlations
with catalogues of known sources. 49 have been searched for spectroscopic
identification at the telescope. 13 fields resulted empty down to R=21. 37
sources have been identified with type 1 AGN and 9 with type 2 AGN. The
remaining are: 5 narrow emission line galaxies, 6 Clusters, 2 BL Lac, 1 Radio
Galaxy and 1 Star. Combining these objects with other hard X-ray selected AGNs
from ASCA and HEAO1, we find that the local luminosity function of type 1 AGN
in the 2-10 keV band is fairly well represented by a double-power-law-function.
There is evidence for significant cosmological evolution according to a pure
luminosity evolution (PLE) model L_X(z)~(1+z)^k, with k=2.12 and k=2.22 in a
(Omega_m,Omega_lambda)=(1.0,0.0) and in a (Omega_m,Omega_lambda)=(0.3,0.7)
cosmology, respectively. The data show an excess of faint high redshift type 1
AGN which is well modeled by a luminosity dependent density evolution (LDDE),
similarly to what observed in the soft X-rays. However, in both cosmologies,
the statistic is not significant enough to distinguish between the PLE and LDDE
models. The fitted models imply a contribution of AGN1 to the 2-10 keV X-ray
background from 35% up to 60%.

Planck satellite due to their thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. We take the
past light-cone effect and the redshift evolution of both the underlying dark
matter correlation function and the cluster bias factor into account. A
theoretical mass-temperature relation allows us to convert the sensitivity
limit of a catalogue into a minimum mass for the dark matter haloes hosting the
clusters. We confirm that the correlation length is an increasing function of
the sensitivity limits defining the survey. Using the expected characteristics
of the Planck cluster catalogue, which will be a quite large and unbiased
sample, we predict the two-point correlation function and power spectrum for
different cosmological models. We show that the wide redshift distribution of
the Planck survey, will allow to constrain the cluster clustering properties up
to z=1. The dependence of our results on the main cosmological parameters (the
matter density parameter, the cosmological constant and the normalisation of
the density power-spectrum) is extensively discussed. We find that the future
Planck clustering data place only mild constraints on the cosmological
parameters, because the results depend on the physical characteristics of the
intracluster medium, like the baryon fraction and the mass-temperature
relation. Once the cosmological model and the Hubble constant are determined,
the clustering data will allow a determination of the baryon fraction with an
accuracy of few per cent.

combined effects of Doppler shifts and aberration are important; the lowest
Legendre multipoles of total intensity receive power from the large CMB
monopole in transforming from the CMB frame. On small angular scales aberration
dominates and is shown here to lead to significant distortions of the total
intensity and polarization multipoles in transforming from the rest frame of
the CMB to the frame of the solar system. We provide convenient analytic
results for the distortions as series expansions in the relative velocity of
the two frames, but at the highest resolutions a numerical quadrature is
required. Although many of the high resolution multipoles themselves are
severely distorted by the frame transformations, we show that their statistical
properties distort by only an insignificant amount. Therefore, cosmological
parameter estimation is insensitive to the transformation from the CMB frame
(where theoretical predictions are calculated) to the rest frame of the
experiment.

with the MPIfR bolometer arrays at the IRAM 30-m telescope. The maps obtained,
of unprecedented quality at these wavelengths, allow a direct comparison with
high-resolution radio maps. Although the spatial structure of the Crab Nebula
does not change much from radio to millimetre wavelengths, we have detected
significant spatial variations of the spectral index between 20 cm and 1.3 mm.
The main effect is a spectral flattening in the inner region, which can be
hardly explained just in terms of the evolution of a single population of
synchrotron emitting electrons. We propose instead that this is the result of
the emergence of a second synchrotron component, that we have tried to extract
from the data. Shape and size of this component resemble those of the Crab
Nebula in X rays. However, while the more compact structure of the Crab Nebula
in X rays is commonly regarded as an effect of synchrotron downgrading, it
cannot be explained why a similar structure is present also at mm wavelengths,
where the electron lifetimes far exceed the nebular age. Our data, combined
with published upper limits on spatial variations of the radio spectral index,
also imply a low-energy cutoff for the distribution of electrons responsible
for this additional synchrotron component. Although no model has been developed
so far to explain the details of this component, one may verify that the total
number of the electrons responsible for it is in agreement with what predicted
by the classical pulsar-wind models, which otherwise are known to fail in
accounting for the number of radio emitting electrons. We have also detected a
spectral steepening at mm wavelengths in some elongated regions, whose
positions match those of radio synchrotron filaments.

Galaxy, Sgr A$^*$, puts new constraints on its theoretical models. The spectrum
is very soft, and the source is rapidly variable. We consider different models
to explain the observations. We find that the features of the x-ray spectrum
can be marginally explained with an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF)
model while it does not well fit the radio spectrum. An ADAF with strong winds
(ADIOS) model is not favored if we assume that the wind does not radiate.
Alternatively, we propose a coupled jet plus accretion disk model to explain
the observations for Sgr A$^*$. The accretion flow is described as an ADAF fed
by Bondi-Hoyle accretion of hot plasma in the Galactic Center region. A small
fraction of the accretion flow is ejected near the black hole, forming a jet
after passing through a shock. As a result, the electron temperature increases
to $\sim 2 \times 10^{11}{\rm K}$, which is about 10 times higher than the
highest temperature attained in the ADAF. The model is self-consistent since
the main jet parameters are determined by the underlying accretion disk at the
inner edge. The emergent spectrum of Sgr A$^*$ is the sum of the emission from
jet and underlying ADAF. The very strong Comptonization of synchrotron emission
from the jet dominates the bremsstrahlung from the ADAF, therefore, a very
short variability timescale is expected and the predicted X-ray slope and the
radio spectrum is in very good agreement with the observations.

popular progenitor models, there should be many failed gamma-ray bursts, i.e.,
fireballs with Lorentz factor much less than 100 -- 1000, but still much larger
than unity. In fact, the number of failed gamma-ray bursts may even be much
larger than that of successful bursts. Owing to the existence of these failed
gamma-ray bursts, there should be many orphan afterglows even if GRBs are due
to isotropic fireballs, then the simple discovery of orphan afterglows never
means that GRBs be collimated. Unfortunately, to distinguish a failed-GRB

problem is that the trigger time is unknown. Some possible solutions to the

strongly confirms and extends to larger clustercentric radii the luminosity

extragalactic flat-spectrum radio sources is generally classified as intra-day
variability (IDV). The origin of this short term variability is still
controversial and both extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms must be considered
and may both contribute to the observed variations. The measured linear and
circular polarization of IDV sources constrains the low energy end of the
electron population. Any population of cold electrons within sources at or
above the equipartition temperature of 10^11 K depolarizes the emission and can
be ruled out. Intrinsic shock models are shown to either violate the large
fraction of sources displaying IDV or they do not relax the light travel time
argument for intrinsic variations. From structure function analysis, we further
conclude that interstellar scintillation also leads to tight size estimates
unless a very local cloud in the ISM is responsible for IDV.

due to correlations between the condensed counterions and in general becomes
smaller as the temperature is increased. For model A a divergent force may
appear as the separation between the rings vanishes, and this makes an
analytical study possible for this model and for vanishing separation, showing
a universal behavior in this limit. Attractive forces are found for model A if

dynamics in various electronic materials. The motivation to examine the spin
degrees of freedom (mostly in electrons, but also in holes and nuclei) comes
from various sources: ranging from novel applications which are either not
feasible or ineffective with conventional electronics, to using spin-dependent
phenomena to explore the fundamental properties of solid state systems. Taken
in a broader context, term spintronics is addressing various aspects of these
efforts and stimulating new interactions between different subfields of
condensed matter physics. Recent advances in material fabrication made it
possible to introduce the nonequilibrium spin in novel class of systems,
including ferromagnetic semiconductors, high temperature superconductors and
carbon nanotubes--which leads to a question of how such a spin could be
utilized. For this purpose it is important to extend the understanding of
spin-polarized transport and spin dynamics to consider inhomogeneous systems,
various heterostructures, and the role of interfaces. This article presents
some views on novel aspects of spin-polarized transport and spin dynamics

We determine the sensitivity of cosmic ray detectors to black hole production

provide the most stringent bound on low-scale gravity, requiring a fundamental

also consider the implications of angular momentum and possible exponentially

rates are still possible. Finally, we demonstrate that even if only a few black
hole events are observed, a standard model interpretation may be excluded by
comparison with Earth-skimming neutrino rates.

dependence of the scale factor and a scalar field in 4d cosmology, but with the
sign of the scalar field potential reversed. Based on this analogy, we
introduce novel methods for studying the warped geometry. We construct the full
phase portraits of the warp factor/scalar system for several examples of the
bulk potential. This allows us to view the global properties of the warped
geometry. For flat branes, the phase portrait is two dimensional. Moving along
typical phase trajectories, the warp factor is initially increasing and finally
decreasing. All trajectories have timelike gradient-dominated singularities at
one or both of their ends, which are reachable in a finite distance and must be
screened by the branes. For curved branes, the phase portrait is three
dimensional. However, as the warp factor increases the phase trajectories tend
towards the two dimensional surface corresponding to flat branes. We discuss
this property as a mechanism that may stretch the curved brane to be almost
flat, with a small cosmological constant. Finally, we describe the embedding of
branes in the 5d bulk using the phase space geometric methods developed here.
In this language the boundary conditions at the branes can be described as a 1d
curve in the phase space. We discuss the naturalness of tuning the brane
potential to stabilize the brane world system.

  quantized in the chiral symmetric phase","85 pages, Latex, no figures",,,,"hep-th",,"  Correlation functions of fermionic fields described by the massless Thirring
model are analysed within the operator formalism developed by Klaiber and the
path-integral approach with massless fermions quantized in the chiral symmetric
phase. We notice that Klaiber's composite fermion operators possess
non-standard properties under parity transformations and construct operators
with standard parity properties. We find that Klaiber's parameterization of a
one-parameter family of solutions of the massless Thirring model is not well
defined, since it is not consistent with the requirement of chiral symmetry. We
show that the dynamical dimensions of correlation functions depend on an
arbitrary parameter induced by ambiguities of the evaluation of the chiral
Jacobian. A non-perturbative renormalization of the massless Thirring model is
discussed. We demonstrate that the infrared divergences of Klaiber's
correlation functions can be transferred into ultra-violet divergences by
renormalization of the wave function of fermionic fields. This makes Klaiber's
correlation functions non-singular in the infrared limit. We show that the
requirement of non-perturbative renormalizability of the massless Thirring
model fixes a free parameter of the path-integral approach. In turn, the
operator formalism is inconsistent with non-perturbative renormalizability of
the massless Thirring model. We carry out a non-perturbative renormalization of
the sine-Gordon model and show that it is not an asymptotically free theory as
well as the massless Thirring model. We calculate the fermion condensate by
using the Fourier transform of the two-point Green function of massless
Thirring fermion fields quantized in the chiral symmetric phase.

torus-fractalization (TF) critical point that occurs at some critical amplitude
of driving. (At smaller amplitudes the bifurcation corresponds to a collision
and subsequent disappearance of two smooth invariant curves, and at larger
amplitudes it is a touch of fractal attractor and repeller at some set of
exceptional points, without coincidence.) For the TF critical point,
renormalization group (RG) analysis is developed. For the golden mean rotation
number a nontrivial fixed-point solution of the RG equation is found in a class

antifreeze and oil waste, city or farm liquid waste, crude oil, etc.) into the
clean burning magnegas plus heat acquired by the liquid feedstock. The
""commercial efficiency"" is defined as the ratio between the total energy output
(energy in magnegas plus heat) and the electric energy used for its production,
while the ""scientific efficiency"" is the usual ratio between the total energy
output and the total energy input (the sum of the electric energy plus the
energy in the liquid feedstock as well as that in the carbon electrodes). A
primary purpose of this paper is to show that conventional thermochemistry does
indeed predict a commercial efficiency bigger than one, although their values
is considerably smaller than the actual efficiency measured in the reactors,
thus indicating the applicability of the covering hadronic chemistry from which
the reactors have received their name. We reach an upper limit of the
commercial efficiency of 3.11 for the use of pure water as feedstock, and of
3.11 to 7.5 for a mixture of ethyleneglicole and water. The study of the heat
produced by the reactions leads to large divergencies between the
thermochemical predictions and experimental data of at least a factor of three.
Such divergencies can only be explained with deviations from quantum chemistry
in favor of the covering hadronic chemistry. In particular, the indicated large
divergencies can only be explained with the assumption that the produced
combustible gas has the new non-valence chemical structure of Santilli
magnecules.

formulation. However, a notion of time is in general possible only when a
classical spacetime geometry exists. Such a geometry is itself produced by
classical matter sources. Thus it could be said that the currently known
formulation of quantum mechanics pre-assumes the presence of classical matter
fields. A more fundamental formulation of quantum mechanics should exist, which
avoids having to use a notion of time. In this paper we discuss as to how such
a fundamental formulation could be constructed for single particle,
non-relativistic quantum mechanics. We argue that there is an underlying
non-linear theory of quantum gravity, to which both standard quantum mechanics
and classical general relativity are approximations. The timeless formulation
of quantum mechanics follows from the underlying theory when the mass of the
particle is much smaller than Planck mass. On the other hand, when the
particle's mass is much larger than Planck mass, spacetime emerges and the
underlying theory should reduce to classical mechanics and general relativity.
We also suggest that noncommutative differential geometry is a possible
candidate for describing this underlying theory.
