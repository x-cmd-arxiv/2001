data from the HST archives. Three of the galaxies were found to host both
populous clusters (M_V<-9.5 at a fiducial age of 10 Myr) and super-star
clusters (M_V<-10.5 at 10 Myr). Four other dwarf galaxies, two of which contain
populous and super-star clusters, were drawn from the literature. We find upper
limits to integrated galactic M_B and star formation rate for the formation of
these clusters. However, galaxies brighter and more active than these limits
rarely form them. Yet when they do form, the associated star formation activity
is very high, with numerous compact clusters of similar age in the same complex
and often evidence for a galaxy-wide perturbation as the trigger. This tendency
to concentrate star formation in localized regions of high column density is
consistent with previous suggestions that self-gravity must be strong and the
pressure must be high to allow a cool phase of gas to exist in equilibrium.
Statistical considerations emphasize the peculiarity of super-star clusters in
dwarf galaxies, which are too small to sample the cluster mass function to that
extreme. We suggest that triggered large-scale flows and ambient gravitational
instabilities in the absence of shear make the clouds that form super-star
clusters in small galaxies. This is unlike the case in spirals where density
wave flows and scale-free compression from turbulence dominate. Further compar-
isons with spirals give insight into Larsen & Richtler's relation between star
formation rate per unit area and the fraction of young stars in massive dense
clusters. We suggest that this relation is the result of a physical connection
between maximum cluster mass, interstellar pressure, column density, and star
formation rate, combined with a size-of-sample effect.

correlation functions of density fluctuations, xi_2 and xi_3, in gravitational
perturbation theory (PT) against large Cold Dark Matter (CDM) simulations. This
comparison is made possible for the first time on large weakly non-linear
scales (>10 Mpc/h) thanks to the development of a new algorithm to estimate
correlation functions for millions of points in only a few minutes. Previous
studies in the literature comparing the PT predictions of the 3-point
statistics to simulations have focused mostly on Fourier space, angular space
or smoothed fields. Results in configuration space, such as the ones presented
here, were limited to small scales were leading order PT gives a poor
approximation. Here we also propose and apply a method for separating the first
and subsequent orders contributions to PT by combining different output times
from the evolved simulations. We find that in all cases there is a regime were
simulations do reproduce the leading order (tree-level) predictions of PT for
the reduced 3-point function Q_3 ~ xi_3/ xi_2^2. For steeply decreasing
correlations (such as the standard CDM model) deviations from the tree-level
results are important even at relatively large scales, ~ 20 Mpc/h. On larger
scales xi_2 goes to zero and the results are dominated by sampling errors. In
more realistic models (like the Lambda CDM cosmology) deviations from the
leading order PT become important at smaller scales ~ 10 Mpc/h, although this
depends on the particular 3-point configuration. (abridge)

they develop convection zones during the `pre-main-sequence' thermal relaxation

requires a surface convection zone (i.e. chemical mixing or angular momentum
loss via a magnetic wind) cannot operate in these stars. We show that no disk
of material surrounding the collision product is produced in off-axis

the shock to be non-spherical. The Chandra image shows a fragmented,

emission lines of O, Ne, and Mg. Equilibrium ionization models indicate that

are more consistent with the shock breakout hypothesis, although they cannot

time). As pulse lag and luminosity have been found to be correlated this also
represents a correlation between peak luminosity and jet-break time. Observed
timescales (variability or spectral lags) as well as peak luminosity naturally
have a strong dependence on the Lorentz factor of the outflow and so we propose
that much of the variety among GRBs has a purely kinematic origin (the speed or
direction of the outflow).
  We explore a model in which the variation among GRBs is due to a variation in
jet-opening angles, and find that the narrowest jets have the fastest outflows.
We also explore models in which the jets have similar morphology and size, and
the variation among bursts is caused by variation in viewing angle and/or due
to a velocity profile. The relations between luminosity, variability, spectral
lag and jet-break time can be qualitatively understood from models in which the
Lorentz factor decreases as a function of angle from the jet axis. One expects

early jet-break time for bursts viewed on axis, while higher viewing
inclinations will yield lower luminosities, longer pulse lags, smoother bursts

$\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission is used to estimate the
magnitudes of compact ($<$ a few 100 pc) nuclear starbursts and to resolve the
controversy over their energetic importance in Seyfert 2 nuclei. For three
selected Seyfert 2 nuclei that have been well studied in the UV, the magnitudes
of the compact nuclear starbursts estimated from the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH emission
(with no extinction correction) are in satisfactory quantitative agreement with
those based on the UV after extinction correction. Based directly on our 3--4
$\mu$m slit spectra, the following two main conclusions are drawn: (1) except
in one case, the observed nuclear 3--4 $\mu$m emission is dominated by AGN and
not by starbursts, and (2) compact nuclear starbursts are detected in 6 out of
13 Seyfert 2 nuclei, but cannot dominate the energetics of the galactic
infrared dust emission in the majority of the observed Seyfert 2 galaxies. For
several sources for which Infrared Space Observatory spectra taken with larger
apertures and/or soft X-ray data are available, these data are combined with
our 3--4 $\mu$m slit spectra, and it is suggested that (3) extended (kpc scale)
star-formation activity is energetically more important than compact nuclear
starbursts, and contributes significantly to the infrared luminosities of
Seyfert 2 galaxies, and (4) the bulk of the energetically significant extended
star-formation activity is of starburst type rather than quiescent normal disk
star-formation; the extended starbursts are responsible for the
superwind-driven soft X-ray emission from Seyfert 2 galaxies. Finally, it is
implied that more powerful AGNs tend to be related to more powerful compact
nuclear starbursts.

in a region of apparent minimum radii of 1.3 x 10^12 m and maximum radii of 2.6

These values suggest that the water masers are radially accelerated, but still
gravitationally bound, in the water-maser region. The most positive and
negative velocity-drifting features were found relatively close to the systemic

circling around the halo centre. We search for families of stable, closed,
non-crossing orbits, and assume that gas in our galaxies moves on these orbits.
Several of our models show strong lopsided gas kinematics, especially the ones
in which the disc spins around its axis in a retrograde sense compared to its
motion around the halo centre. We are able to reproduce the HI velocity map of

regions of irregular orbits in the models where the halo density is low. This
may indicate that these models are unstable.

with the evidence for a misfitting of the lower portion of the MS. Moreover one
finds two well known overshooting signatures, as given by i) the large
extension of the ""hook"" preceding the overall contraction gap, and ii) the
scarcity of stars just at the end of the gap. We show that the overluminosity
of He burning stars appears as a constant prediction of models based on updated
physics, whereas alternative assumptions about the Equation of State can
account for the MS fitting. Moreover, due to the scarse statistical
significance of the observational sample, one finds that overshooting
signatures can be present also in canonical (without overshooting) predictions.
We conclude that, unfortunately, NGC2420 does not keep the promise to be of
help in costraining the actual dimensions of convective cores in H burning MS
stars, suggesting in the meantime that using clumping He burning stars as

dark matter are treated as collisionless N-body systems. The ISM is numerically
described by a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) approach for the diffuse

galactic components are coupled by several phase transitions like star
formation, stellar death or condensation and evaporation processes within the

during outbursts of dwarf novae, an important feature, is discussed in the
context of the disk instability model. The ordering of tidal truncation radius,
the 3:1 and 2:1 resonance radius in systems of different mass ratio naturally
leads to a classification of dwarf nova systems in three groups according to

and a compact object (presumably a white dwarf) in galactic cusps is calculated
with help of the so-called loss cone approximation. For a power low cusp of
radius $r_{a}$, the black hole mass $M\sim 10^{6}M_{\odot}$, this rate $\dot

10^{-9}K(p){({M\over 10^{6}M_{\odot}})}^{1/2}{({r_{a}\over

the cusp profile, and for the standard cusp profiles with $p=1/4$ $K(p)\sim 2$.
We estimate the probability ${\it Pr}$ of finding of a compact object orbiting
around a black hole with period $P$ in one particular galaxy to be ${\it

  April, 2002. 22 pages, 4 figures",,"10.1086/339166",,"astro-ph",,"  The ASCA calibration has evolved considerably since launch and indeed, is
still evolving. There have been concerns in the literature that changes in the
ASCA calibration have resulted in the Fe-Kalpha lines in active galaxies (AGN)
now being systematically narrower than was originally thought. If this were
true, a large body of ASCA results would be impacted. In particular, it has
been claimed that the broad red wing (when present) of the Fe-Kalpha line has
been considerably weakened by changes in the ASCA calibration. We demonstrate
explicitly that changes in the ASCA calibration over a period of about eight
years have a negligible effect on the width, strength, or shape of the
Fe-Kalpha lines. The reduction in both width and equivalent width is only ~8%
or less. We confirm this with simulations and individual sources, as well as
sample average profiles. The average profile for type 1 AGN is still very
broad, with the red wing extending down to ~4 keV. The reason for the claimed,
apparently large, discrepancies is that in some sources the \fekalfa line is
complex, and a single-Gaussian model, being an inadequate description of the

Other recent experimental results find strong indications that the universe is
``flat.'' In this paper, I investigate some solutions of Einstein's field
equations which go smoothly between Schwarzschild's relativistic gravitational
solution near a mass concentration to the Friedmann-Lemaitre expanding universe
solution. In particular, the static, curved-space extension of the Lemaitre-
Schwarzschild solution in vacuum is given. Uniqueness conditions are discussed.
One of these metrics preserves the ``cosmological equation.'' We find that when
the rate of expansion of the universe is increasing, space is broken up into
domains of attraction. Outside a domain of attraction, the expansion of the
universe is strong enough to accelerate a test particle away from the domain
boundary. I give a domain-size--mass relationship. This relationship may very
well be important to our understanding of the large scale structure of the

functions exhibit a large degree of universality by falling onto a single or
several distinct master curves. In the repulsive regime, where a stretched
exponential times a power law form (de Cloizeaux scaling) can be applied, the
corresponding exponents $\delta$ and $\theta$ have been obtained. The exponent
$\delta=1/\nu$ is found to be universal for flexible strongly repulsive coils
and in agreement with the theoretical prediction from improved higher-order
Borel-resummed renormalisation group calculations. The short-distance exponents
$\theta_{\upsilon}$ of an open flexible chain are in a good agreement with the
theoretical predictions in the strongly repulsive regime also. However,
increasing the Kuhn length in relation to the monomer size leads to their fast
cross-over towards the Gaussian behaviour. Likewise, a strong sensitivity of
various exponents $\theta_{ij}$ on the stiffness of the chain, or on the number
of arms in star polymers, is observed. The correlation functions in the
globular state are found to have a more complicated oscillating behaviour and
their degree of universality has been reviewed. Average shapes of the polymers

Although crystals of the cuprate high-Tc superconductors are not granular in a
structural sense, theory indicates that at low hole densities the holes can
become concentrated at some locations resulting in hole-rich superconducting
domains [2-5]. Granular superconductivity due to Josephson tunneling through
'undoped' regions between such domains would represent a new paradigm for the
underdoped cuprates. Here we report studies of the spatial interrelationships
between STM tunneling spectra in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x. They reveal an
apparent spatial segregation of the electronic structure into ~3nm diameter
domains (with superconducting characteristics and local energy gap delta<50
meV) in an electronically distinct background. To explore whether this
represents nanoscale segregation of two distinct electronic phases, we employ
scattering-resonances at Ni impurity atoms [6] as 'markers' for the local
existence of superconductivity [7-9]. No Ni-resonances are detected in any
regions where delta>50(2.5) meV. These observations suggest that underdoped
Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x is a mixture of two different short-range electronic orders
with the long-range characteristics of a granular superconductor.

considered: (a) a deterministic force proportional to the particle velocity

from linear integral equations which can be approximately solved by means of a
Sonine polynomial expansion. In the leading order, we get those coefficients as

few conducting channels mesoscopic fluctuations of the supercurrent are
significant and its amplitude can be strongly enhanced due to resonant effects.
In the many channel limit averaging over the scattering phase effectively
suppresses interference effects for systems with {\it two} insulating barriers.
In that case a standard quasiclassical approach describing scattering at
interfaces by means of Zaitsev boundary conditions allows to reproduce the
correct results. However, in systems with {\it three} or more barriers the
latter approach fails even in the many channel limit. In such systems
interference effects remain important in this limit as well. For short
junctions these effects result in additional suppression of the Josephson
critical current indicating the tendency of the system towards localization.
For relatively long junctions interference effects may -- on the contrary --
enhance the supercurrent with respect to the case of independent barriers.

breaking driven by anomaly mediation. We consider a 5-dimensional ""brane
universe"" where the visible and hidden sectors are localized on different
branes, and the standard model gauge bosons propagate in the bulk. In this
framework there can be charged scalar messengers that have contact interactions
with the hidden sector, either localized in the hidden sector or in the bulk.
These scalars obtain soft masses that feed into visible sector scalar masses at
two loop order via bulk gauge interactions. This contribution is automatically
flavor-blind, and can be naturally positive. If the messengers are in the bulk
this contribution is automatically the same order of magnitude as the anomaly
mediated contribution, independent of the brane spacing. If the messengers are
localized to a brane the two effects are of the same order for relatively small
brane spacings. The gaugino masses and A terms are determined completely by
anomaly mediation. In order for anomaly mediation to dominate over radion
mediation the radion must be is stabilized in a manner that preserves
supersymmetry, with supergravity effects included. We show that this occurs in
simple models. We also show that the mu problem can be solved by the vacuum
expectation value of a singlet in this framework.

quark, the lightest neutralino and two light fermions may compete with the much
publicized loop induced two body decay into a charm quark and the lightest
neutralino. We systematically study the parameter space in mSUGRA where the
lighter stop squark turns out to be the NLSP and calculate the branching ratios
of the competing channels in both models. Our results show that the four body
decay may indeed be the main discovery channel particularly in the low tan
$\beta$ scenarios. We discuss the detectability of stop squark pairs in the
4-body decay channel leading to one lepton with 2 or more jets accompanied by a
large amount of missing energy. We also studied the corresponding background
processes and the kinematic cuts required to suppress them using parton level
Monte Carlo simulations. We have commented upon with illustrative examples, the
required revision of the existing mass limits of the stop NLSP assumed to decay
solely into the loop induced 2-body channel in the presence of the competing

special attention to the weak decay of Lambda hypernuclei. The models proposed
for the evaluation of the Lambda decay widths are summarized and their results
are compared with the data. Despite the recent intensive investigations, the
main open problem remains a sound theoretical interpretation of the large
experimental values of the ratio G_n/G_p. Although recent works offer a step
forward in the solution of the puzzle, further efforts must be invested in
order to understand the detailed dynamics of the non-mesonic decay. Even if, by
means of single nucleon spectra measurements, the error bars on G_n/G_p have
been considerably reduced very recently at KEK, a clean extraction of G_n/G_p
is needed. What is missing at present, but planned for the next future, are
measurements of 1) nucleon energy spectra in double coincidence and 2) nucleon
angular correlations: such observations allow to disentangle the nucleons
produced in one- and two-body induced decays and lead to a direct determination
of G_n/G_p. For the asymmetric non-mesonic decay of polarized hypernuclei the
situation is even more puzzling. Indeed, strong inconsistencies appear already
among data. A recent experiment obtained a positive intrinsic Lambda asymmetry
parameter, a_{Lambda}, for 5_{Lambda}He. This is in complete disagreement with
a previous measurement, which obtained a large and negative a_{Lambda} for
p-shell hypernuclei, and with theory, which predicts a negative value
moderately dependent on nuclear structure effects. Also in this case, improved
experiments establishing with certainty the sign and magnitude of a_{Lambda}
for s- and p-shell hypernuclei will provide a guidance for a deeper
understanding of hypernuclear dynamics and decay mechanisms.

rotational invariance in light-front dynamics affects the binding energy and
the form factors of the deuteron. To do this, we derive new light-front
nucleon-nucleon one- and two-meson-exchange potentials, and use the potentials
to solve for the deuteron wave function and binding energy. We find that
including two-meson-exchange (TME) potentials partially repairs the broken
rotational invariance of the one-meson-exchange (OME) potential. This is shown
by a decrease in binding energy difference of different $m$ states of the
deuteron. We calculate the matrix elements of the electromagnetic current using
the deuteron wave functions obtained from the OME and OME+TME potentials.
Rotational invariance requires that the matrix elements satisfy an angular
condition, but in light-front dynamics that condition is only partially
satisfied. The current matrix elements from the OME calculation satisfy the
angular condition better than the ones from the OME+TME calculation. The matrix
elements of the axial current satisfy the angular condition to the same extent
regardless of which wave functions are used for the calculation. Finally, we
find that at momentum transfers greater than about 2 GeV$^2$, the breaking of
rotational invariance causes less uncertainty in the computed deuteron form
factors than do the uncertainties in the nucleon form factors.

  Application to the Measurement of Beam Divergence","16 pages,8 Figures, submitted to NIMB, November 30, 2001",,,,"physics.acc-ph",,"  Optical transition radiation interferometry (OTRI) has been shown to be a
very useful technique to measure the divergence of electron beams with energies
in the range of 15-100 MeV. However, application of this method to low energy
or very high quality beams is limited by scattering in the front foil of the
interferometer. To overcome this limitation we propose to use a perforated
front foil. For the beam energy and hole sizes we are considering, the
unscattered beam electrons passing through the holes will produce diffraction
radiation (ODR). The total radiation produced from the first and second foils
then will be a spatially coherent sum of ODR and OTR from unscattered and
scattered electrons. By controlling the number and size of the perforations,
the inter-foil spacing, the thickness of the first foil and the wavelength and
band pass of the observed radiation, the coherent interferences due to the
unscattered portion of the beam can be isolated and observed. The visibility of
these interferences can then be used to determine the rms beam divergence. We
have developed a general computer code which can be used to calculate
diffraction radiation from any type of perforation and another code to compute
the ODR-OTR interference pattern for a given set of beam and optical
parameters. These codes are employed in the design of an interferometer to
measure the divergence of the ATF accelerator operating at 30 MeV. This beam
will be used in an initial proof of principle experiment for the ODR-OTR
interferometer. We present the results of our code calculations which show that
the expected divergence, 200 micro radians, can be easily measured.

theorem, we show that in the case of a single qubit the number of
distinguishable states is
$W(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,n)=|\alpha_1-\alpha_2|\sqrt{\frac{2n}{\pi e}}$, where
$(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)$ is the angle interval from which the states are chosen.
In the general case of an $N$-dimensional Hilbert space and an area $\Omega$ of
the domain on the unit sphere from which the states are chosen, the number of

of quantum mechanics due to Lockwood (and Deutsch) do not provide a coherent
interpretation of the quantum mechanical probabilistic algorithm. By contrast,
in Albert and Loewer's version of the many minds interpretation there is a
coherent interpretation of the quantum mechanical probabilities. We consider
Albert and Loewer's probability interpretation in the context of Bell-type and
GHZ-type states and argue that it exhibits a certain form of nonlocality which
is, however, much weaker than Bell's nonlocality.
