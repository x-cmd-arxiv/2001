(PT) to understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe. We first
discuss the dynamics of gravitational instability, from the linear to the
non-linear regime. This includes Eulerian and Lagrangian PT, non-linear
approximations, and a brief description of numerical simulation techniques. We
then cover the basic statistical tools used in cosmology to describe cosmic
fields, such as correlations functions in real and Fourier space, probability
distribution functions, cumulants and generating functions. In subsequent
sections we review the use of PT to make quantitative predictions about these
statistics according to initial conditions, including effects of possible non
Gaussianity of the primordial fields. Results are illustrated by detailed
comparisons of PT predictions with numerical simulations. The last sections
deal with applications to observations. First we review in detail practical
estimators of statistics in galaxy catalogs and related errors, including
traditional approaches and more recent developments. Then, we consider the
effects of the bias between the galaxy distribution and the matter
distribution, the treatment of redshift distortions in three-dimensional
surveys and of projection effects in angular catalogs, and some applications to
weak gravitational lensing. We finally review the current observational
situation regarding statistics in galaxy catalogs and what the future
generation of galaxy surveys promises to deliver.

highlight the study of rotation curves of distant spirals; the fundamental

experimental defects, there is a clear need for an improvement to the existing

before. These are: a few percent energy transfer into the EAS electromagnetic
component due to electron-positron pair production or electromagnetic radiation
of quark-gluon plasma and a small slow-down of the cascading process in its
initial stages associated with the extended lifetime of excited nuclear
fragments. The latter process displaces the shower maximum deeper into the

alternative simple derivation of the Kerr constant is also given assuming that

both the case when the thickness of the surface layer is neglected and when the
droplet is covered by a layer of nonzero thickness. The result differs
significantly from that used in the literature to describe the Kerr-effect

and far-from-optimal payoff distributions. We have also identified ways of
information presentation that can considerably improve the overall performance

means of user-specific recommendations, a stochastic behavioural description is
developed. These strategies manage to increase the adaptibility to changing
conditions and to reduce the deviation from the time-dependent user
equilibrium, thereby enhancing the average and individual payoffs. Hence, our
guidance strategies can increase the performance of all users by reducing
overreaction and stabilizing the decision dynamics. These results are highly
significant for predicting decision behaviour, for reaching optimal behavioural
distributions by decision support systems, and for information service
providers. One of the promising fields of application is traffic optimization.

the nu_mu to nu_e transition probability and the nu_mu survival probability
through counting experiments at large water-Cerenkov detector. We study
sensitivity of such experiments to the neutrino mass hierarchy, the
mass-squared differences, the three angles, and one CP phase of the
three-generation lepton-flavor-mixing matrix. We find that experiments at a
distance between 1,000 and 2,000 km can determine the sign of the larger
mass-squared difference (m_3^2-m_1^2) if the mixing between nu_e and nu_3 (the
heaviest-or-lightest neutrino) is not too small; 2|U_{e3}|^2(1-|U_{e3}|^2) gsim
0.03. The CP phase can be constrained if the |U_{e3}| element is sufficiently
large, 2|U_{e3}|^2(1-|U_{e3}|^2) gsim 0.06, and if the smaller mass-squared
difference (m_2^2-m_1^2) and the U_{e2} element are in the prefered range of
the large-mixing-angle solution of the solar-neutrino deficit. The magunitude |
m_3^2-m_1^2| and the matrix element U_{mu 3} can be precisely measured, but we

stable non-BPS configuration of two walls. The stability is assured by a
topological quantum number associated with the winding on the field space of
the topology of $S^1$. We propose that the overlap of the wave functions of the

system of nonlinearly coupled cubic Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) equations with a
group-velocity mismatch between them, where each CGL equation is stabilized by
linearly coupling it to an additional linear dissipative equation. In the
context of nonlinear fiber optics, the model describes transmission and
collisions of pulses at different wavelengths in a dual-core fiber, in which
the active core is furnished with bandwidth-limited gain, while the other,
passive (lossy) one is necessary for stabilization of the solitary pulses.
Complete and incomplete collisions of pulses in two channels in the cases of
anomalous and normal dispersion in the active core are analyzed by means of
perturbation theory and direct numerical simulations. It is demonstrated that
the model may readily support fully stable pulses whose collisions are
quasi-elastic, provided that the group-velocity difference between the two
channels exceeds a critical value. In the case of quasi-elastic collisions, the
temporal shift of pulses, predicted by the analytical approach, is in
semi-quantitative agrement with direct numerical results in the case of
anomalous dispersion (in the opposite case, the perturbation theory does not
apply). We also consider a simultaneous collision between pulses in three
channels, concluding that this collision remains quasi-elastic, and the pulses
remain completely stable. Thus, the model may be a starting point for the
design of a stabilized wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) transmission
system.

may be more time-consuming than another for any possible interaction. This
defines a partial order structure in the set of non-local gates, that compares

assigns, with minimum probability of error, the state of a quantum system to
one or the other of two complementary subsets of a set of N given
non-orthogonal quantum states occurring with given a priori probabilities. A
general analytical solution is obtained for N states that are restricted to a
two-dimensional subspace of the Hilbert space of the system. The result for the
special case of three arbitrary but linearly dependent states is applied to a
variety of sets of three states that are symmetric and equally probable. It is
found that, in this case, the minimum error probability for distinguishing one
of the states from the other two is only about half as large as the minimum
error probability for distinguishing all three states individually.
