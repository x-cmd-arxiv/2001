two penetrate the surrounding H I wall. Reliable values of N(H I) were

(1.52 +/- 0.08) x10-5 (1 sigma uncertainty in the mean). It is likely that the

that the O I column densities can serve as a proxy for H I in the Local Bubble.

x10-4, comparable to the weighted mean (3.43 +/- 0.15) x10-4 reported for 13

is half that reported by Meyer et al. (1997) for seven sight lines with larger

variability of O I/N I (six sight lines) indicates that at the low column
densities found in the LISM, nitrogen ionization balance is important. Thus,
unlike O I, N I cannot be used as a proxy for H I or as a metallicity indicator

non-adiabatic perturbations in Cosmology. We study adiabatic (curvature) and
entropy (isocurvature) perturbations produced during a period of cosmological
inflation that is driven by multiple scalar fields with an arbitrary
interaction potential. A local rotation in field space is performed to separate
out the adiabatic and entropy modes. The resulting field equations show
explicitly how on large scales entropy perturbations can source adiabatic
perturbations if the background solution follows a curved trajectory in field
space, and how adiabatic perturbations cannot source entropy perturbations in
the long-wavelength limit. We show why one in general expects the adiabatic and
entropy perturbations to be correlated at the end of inflation. Then, we
consider two-field preheating after inflation, examining conditions under which
entropy perturbations can alter the large-scale curvature perturbation and
showing how our new formalism has advantages in numerical stability when the
background solution follows a non-trivial trajectory in field space. Then we
compare the latest cosmic microwave background data with theoretical
predictions including correlated adiabatic and CDM isocurvature perturbations.
We find that there is a degeneracy between the amplitude of correlated
isocurvature perturbations and the spectral tilt. We then study perturbations
in Randall-Sundrum-type brane-world cosmologies. The density perturbations
generate Weyl curvature in the bulk, which in turn backreacts on the brane via
stress-energy perturbations. Bulk effects produce a non-adiabatic mode, even
when the matter perturbations are adiabatic, and alter the background dynamics.

extinction is estimated to be less than 0.1 mag from the intensity decrements
of the dust features and from the spiral surface filling factor, which is about
constant for all radii and sizes. The nuclear dust spirals differ from
main-disk spirals in several respects: the nuclear spirals have no associated
star formation, they are very irregular with both trailing and leading
components that often cross, they become darker as they approach the center,
they completely fill the inner disks with a constant areal density, making the
number of distinct spirals (the azimuthal wavenumber m) increase linearly with
radius, and their number decreases with increasing arm width as a power law.
Fourier transform power spectra of the spirals, taken in the azimuthal
direction, show a power law behavior with a slope of -5/3 over the range of
frequencies where the power stands above the pixel noise. This is the same
slope as that found for the one-dimensional power spectra of HI emission in the
Large Magellanic Cloud, and also the slope expected for a thin turbulent disk.
All of these properties suggest that the dust spirals are a manifestation of
acoustic turbulence in the inner gas disks of these galaxies. Such turbulence
should dissipate orbital energy and transfer angular momentum outward, leading
to a steady accretion of gas toward the nucleus.

  Models and Power Law Slopes","accepted for ApJ 564, January 10, 2002, 8 figures",,"10.1086/324384",,"astro-ph",,"  Three-dimensional fractal models on grids of 200**3 pixels are generated from
the inverse Fourier transform of noise with a power law cutoff, exponentiated
to give a log normal distribution of density. The fractals are clipped at
various intensity levels and the mass and size distribution functions of the
clipped peaks and their subpeaks are determined. These distribution functions
are analogous to the cloud mass functions determined from maps of the fractal
interstellar medium using various thresholds for the definition of a cloud. The
model mass functions are found to be power laws with powers ranging from -1.6
to -2.4 in linear mass intervals as the clipping level increases from 0.03 to
0.3 of the peak intensity. The low clipping value gives a cloud filling factor
of 0.1 and should be a good model for molecular cloud surveys. The agreement
between the mass spectrum of this model and the observed cloud and clump mass
spectra suggests that a pervasively fractal interstellar medium can be
interpreted as a cloud/intercloud medium if the peaks of the fractal intensity
distribution are taken to be clouds. Their mass function is a power law even
though the density distribution function in the gas is a log-normal. This is
because the size distribution function of the clipped clouds is a power law,
and with clipping, each cloud has about the same average density. A similar
result would apply to projected clouds that are clipped fractals, giving nearly
constant column densities for power law mass functions. The steepening of the
mass function for higher clip values suggests a partial explanation for the
steeper slope of the mass functions for star clusters and OB associations,
which sample denser regions of interstellar gas.

associated with the fold, we derive analytic expressions for the photometric
and astrometric behavior near a generic fold caustic. We show how this form
reduces to the more familiar linear caustic, which lenses a nearby source into
two images which have equal magnification, opposite parity, and are equidistant
from the critical curve. In this case, the simplicity and high degree of
symmetry allows for the derivation of semi-analytic expressions for the
photometric and astrometric deviations in the presence of finite sources with
arbitrary surface brightness profiles. We use our results to derive some basic
properties of astrometric microlensing near folds, in particular we predict for
finite sources with uniform and limb darkening profiles, the detailed shape of
the astrometric curve as the source crosses a fold. We find that the
astrometric effects of limb darkening will be difficult to detect with the
currently planned accuracy of the Space Interferometry Mission. We verify our
results by numerically calculating the expected astrometric shift for the

finding excellent agreement with our analytic expressions. Our results can be
applied to any lensing system with fold caustics, including Galactic binary

R<=140'' which is followed by a rapid drop off at larger radii, where the

obtain the blue luminosity and virial mass for all systems considered. We
devote a large effort to establishing the homogeneity of the resulting values,
as well as to considering comparable physical regions, i.e. those included
within the virial radius. By analyzing a fiducial, combined sample of 294
systems we find that the mass increases faster than the luminosity: the linear
fit gives M\propto L_B^{1.34 \pm 0.03}, with a tendency for a steeper increase
in the low--mass range. In agreement with the previous work, our present
results are superior owing to the much higher statistical significance and the
wider dynamical range covered (about 10^{12}-10^{15} M_solar). We present a
comparison between our results and the theoretical predictions on the relation
between M/L_B and halo mass, obtained by combining cosmological numerical
simulations and semianalytic modeling of galaxy formation.

attaining the requisite sensitivity of the triangular 3-spacecraft LISA
configuration. Raw laser noise is several orders of magnitude above the other
noises and thus it is essential to bring it down to the level of other noises
such as shot, acceleration, etc. Since it is impossible to maintain equal
distances between spacecrafts, laser noise cancellation must be achieved by
appropriately combining the six beams with appropriate time-delays. It has been
shown in several recent papers that such combinations are possible. In this
paper, we present a rigorous and systematic formalism based on algebraic
geometrical methods involving computational commutative algebra, which
generates in principle {\it all} the data combinations cancelling the laser
frequency noise. The relevant data combinations form the first module of
syzygies, as it is called in the literature of algebraic geometry. The module
is over a polynomial ring in three variables, the three variables corresponding
to the three time-delays around the LISA triangle. Specifically, we list
several sets of generators for the module whose linear combinations with
polynomial coefficients generate the entire module. We find that this formalism
can also be extended in a straight forward way to cancel Doppler shifts due to
optical bench motions. The two modules are infact isomorphic.
  We use our formalism to obtain the transfer functions for the six beams and
for the generators. We specifically investigate monochromatic gravitational
wave sources in the LISA band and carry out the maximisiation over linear
combinations of the generators of the signal-to-noise ratios with the frequency
and source direction angles as parameters.

observable, which is equivalent to the gluon propagator in a certain gauge. The
correlator describes a gluon coupled to static sources and decays with
eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian, permitting a non-perturbative definition of a
gluonic parton mass. Detailed numerical tests of the observable are performed
in SU(2) gauge theories in 2+1 dimensions. In a Higgs model it reproduces the
physical W-boson mass, while in a confining theory its non-local nature results
in almost exclusive projection onto torelonic states. However, the gluon mass
can also be related to the mass difference between the lowest gluelumps, i.e.
gluon configurations bound to adjoint sources. Its value is computed in SU(2)
pure gauge theory in 2+1 dimensions to be m_A=0.360(19)g^2, which plays an
important role as ""magnetic mass"" of the four-dimensional theory at high
temperatures. The same quantity is found to determine the mass splitting
between vector and scalar mesons in the three-dimensional theory. In SU(3) pure

m_A\approx 370 MeV. Possible relations of this quantity with the QCD heavy

We evaluate the QCD corrections to box and Z^0-penguin diagrams with top-quark,

boson penguin diagrams. We provide a compendium of analytic formulae for the
Wilson coefficients, which are valid for arbitrary values of tan(beta) (the
ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs fields) except for the
case of the neutral Higgs-boson contributions. These contributions have been
obtained at large tan(beta), which may compensate for the inevitable
suppression by the masses of the light leptons in decays based on the b -> s
(d) l^+ l^- transition. We investigate the dependence of the various branching
ratios on the renormalization scale mu, which is the main theoretical
uncertainty in the short-distance calculation. We find that the mu dependence

taken into account. The contributions of new operators are found to be dominant
at large tan(beta) in B_{d,s} -> mu^+ mu^- while they are subleading in B ->

known that 4-dimensional Einstein gravity is restored at low energies on either

formalism we extend the theory of weak gravity in the brane world scenarios to
higher energies, or shorter distances. We argue that weak gravity on either
brane is indistinguishable from 4-dimensional higher derivative gravity,
provided that the inter-brane distance (radion) is stabilized, that the
background bulk scalar field is changing near the branes and that the
background bulk geometry near the branes is warped. This argument holds for a
general conformal transformation to a frame in which matter on the branes is
minimally coupled to the metric. In particular, Newton's constant and the
coefficients of curvature-squared terms in the 4-dimensional effective action
are determined up to an ambiguity of adding a Gauss-Bonnet topological term. In
other words, we provide the brane-world realization of the so called
$R^2$-model without utilizing a quantum theory. We discuss the appearance of
composite spin-2 and spin-0 fields in addition to the graviton on the brane and
point out a possibility that the spin-0 field may play the role of an effective
inflaton to drive brane-world inflation. Finally, we conjecture that the
sequence of higher derivative terms is an infinite series and, thus, indicates
non-locality in the brane world scenarios.

scalar field theory in d-dimensional de Sitter space. We consider a
one-parameter family of dS-invariant vacua related by Bogolyubov
transformations and compute the corresponding Green functions. It is shown that
none of these Green functions correspond to the one obtained by analytic
continuation from AdS. Among this family of vacua are in (out) vacua which have
no incoming (outgoing) particles on past (future) infinity. Surprisingly, it is
shown that in odd spacetime dimensions the in and out vacua are the same,
implying the absence of particle production for this state. The correlators of
the boundary CFT, as defined by the dS/CFT correspondence, are shown to depend
on the choice of vacuum state - the correlators with all points on past
infinity vanish in the in vacuum. For dS_3 we argue that this bulk vacuum
dependence of the correlators is dual to a deformation of the boundary CFT_2 by
a specific marginal operator. It is also shown that Witten's non-standard de
Sitter inner product (slightly modified) reduces to the standard inner product
of the boundary field theory. Next we consider a scalar field in the Kerr-dS_3
Euclidean vacuum. A density matrix is constructed by tracing out over modes
which are causally inaccessible to a single geodesic observer. This is shown to
be a thermal state at the Kerr-dS_3 temperature and angular potential. It is
further shown that, assuming Cardy's formula, the microscopic entropy of such a
thermal state in the boundary CFT precisely equals the Bekenstein-Hawking value
of one quarter the area of the Kerr-dS_3 horizon.

the micro-support of an L-module; it is a set of irreducible modules for the
Levi quotients of the parabolic Q-subgroups associated to the strata. We prove
a vanishing theorem for the global cohomology of an L-module in term of the
micro-support. We calculate the micro-support of the middle weight profile
weighted cohomology and the middle perversity intersection cohomology
L-modules. (For intersection cohomology we must assume the Q-root system has no
component of type D_n, E_n, or F_4.) Finally we prove a functoriality theorem
concerning the behavior of micro-support upon restriction of an L-module to the
pre-image of a Satake stratum. As an application we settle a conjecture made

quantum theory. This framework refines and improves traditional atomism in two
crucial respects. First, the elementary constituents of matter belong to a very
small number of classes, and all objects of a given class (e.g., all electrons)
are rigorously identical, indeed indistinguishable. This profound identity is
demonstrated empirically through the phenomena of quantum statistics, and is
explained by the principles of free quantum field theory. Second, objects of
one class can mutate into objects of other classes. Such mutability can be
understood as manifesting interacting quantum field theory. Fermi contributed
to establishing theoretical foundations for the new viewpoint, through his work
on quantum statistics and quantum field theory, and to its fruitful application
and empirical validation, through his work on beta decay, nuclear
transmutation, and primeval strong interaction theory.

binding over a wide range merely by mutating the binding sequence of a target
site. This functional demand, together with physical constraints arising from
the thermodynamics and kinetics of TF-DNA interaction, leads us to a narrow
range of ``optimal'' interaction parameters. We find that this parameter set
agrees well with experimental data for the interaction parameters of a few
exemplary prokaryotic TF's. This indicates that TF-DNA interaction is indeed
programmable. We suggest further experiments to test whether this is a general
feature for a large class of TF's.

time evolution can be interpreted as the pointer of a clock. The quality of
such a clock is given by the statistical distinguishability of its states at
different times. If a clock is used as a resource for producing another one the
latter can at most have the quality of the resource. We show that this
principle, formalized by a quasi-order, implies constraints on many physical
processes. Similarly, the degree to which two (quantum or classical) clocks are
synchronized can be formalized by a quasi-order of synchronism.
  Copying timing information is restricted by quantum no-cloning and
no-broadcasting theorems since classical clocks can only exist in the limit of
infinite energy. We show this quantitatively by comparing the Fisher timing
information of two output systems to the input's timing information. For
classical signal processing in the quantum regime our results imply that a
signal looses its localization in time if it is amplified and distributed to
many devices.

evolution typically causes chaotic quantum systems to generate structure that
varies on the scale of phase-space volume elements of size $(\hbar^2/A)^d$,
where A is a classical action characteristic of the state and d is the number
of degrees of freedom, and that (2) this structure implies that a small change
in a phase-space coordinate X by an amount $\delta X \sim \hbar X/A$
generically results in an orthogonal state. While we agree with (1), we argue
that (2) is not correct if the number of degrees of freedom is small. Our
arguments are based on the Berry-Voros ansatz for the structure of energy
eigenstates in chaotic systems. We find, however, that (2) becomes valid if the
number of degrees of freedom is large. This implies that many-body environments
may be crucial for the phenomenon of quantum decoherence.

The polarization quantum-interference pattern is found to vary strongly with
the spacing between the two crystals. This is found to be a cooperative effect
due to two mechanisms: the chromatic dispersion of the medium separating the
crystals and spatiotemporal effects which arise from the inclusion of
transverse wave vectors. These effects provide two concomitant avenues for
controlling the quantum state generated in SPDC. We expect these results to be
of interest for the development of quantum technologies and the generation of

of an optical or atom laser far above threshold is a mixture of coherent field
states with random phase, or, equivalently, a Poissonian mixture of number
states. We are interested in which, if either, of these descriptions of
$\rho_{ss}$, is more natural. In the preceding paper we concentrated upon
whether descriptions such as these are physically realizable (PR). In this
paper we investigate another relevant aspect of these ensembles, their
robustness. A robust ensemble is one for which the pure states that comprise it
survive relatively unchanged for a long time under the system evolution. We
determine numerically the most robust ensembles as a function of the parameters
in the laser model: the self-energy $\chi$ of the bosons in the laser mode, and
the excess phase noise $\nu$. We find that these most robust ensembles are PR
ensembles, or similar to PR ensembles, for all values of these parameters. In
the ideal laser limit ($\nu=\chi=0$), the most robust states are coherent
states. As the phase noise $\nu$ or phase dispersion $\chi$ is increased, the
most robust states become increasingly amplitude-squeezed. We find scaling laws
for these states. As the phase diffusion or dispersion becomes so large that
the laser output is no longer quantum coherent, the most robust states become
so squeezed that they cease to have a well-defined coherent amplitude. That is,
the quantum coherence of the laser output is manifest in the most robust PR
states having a well-defined coherent amplitude. This lends support to the idea
that robust PR ensembles are the most natural description of the state of the
laser mode. It also has interesting implications for atom lasers in particular,
for which phase dispersion due to self-interactions is expected to be large.
