evolving in a close binary system, from the main sequence phase to the
formation of a compact remnant and fallback of supernova debris. After core
hydrogen exhaustion, the star expands, loses most of its envelope by Roche lobe
overflow, and becomes a Wolf-Rayet star. We study its post-mass transfer
evolution as a function of the Wolf-Rayet wind mass loss rate (which is
currently not well constrained and will probably vary with initial metallicity
of the star). Varying this mass loss rate by a factor 6 leads to stellar masses
at collapse that range from 3.1 to 10.7 solar masses. Although the iron core
masses at collapse are generally larger for stars with larger final masses,
they do not depend monotonically on the final stellar mass or even the C/O-core
mass. We then compute the evolution of all models through collapse and bounce.
The results range from strong supernova explosions for the lower final masses
to the direct collapse of the star into a black hole for the largest final
mass. Correspondingly, the final remnant masses, which were computed by
following the supernova evolution and fallback of material for a time scale of
about one year, are between 1.2 and 10 solar masses. We discuss the remaining
uncertainties of this result and outline the consequences of our results for
the understanding of the progenitor evolution of X-ray binaries and gamma-ray
burst models.

Institute of Mining and Technology. The experiment is designed to demonstrate
in the laboratory the alpha-omega magnetic dynamo, which is believed to operate
in many rotating and conducting astrophysical objects. The experiment uses the
Couette flow of liquid sodium between two cylinders rotating with different
angular velocities to model the omega-effect. The alpha-effect is created by
the rising and expanding jets of liquid sodium driven through a pair of
orifices in the end plates of the cylindrical vessel, presumably simulating
plumes driven by buoyancy in astrophysical objects. The water analog of the
dynamo device has been constructed and the flow necessary for the dynamo has
been demonstrated. Results of the numerical simulations of the kinematic dynamo
are presented. The toroidal field produced by the omega-effect is predicted to
be B_{\phi} \simeq (R_m/2\pi) B_{poloidal}\simeq 20 \times B_{poloidal} for the
expected magnetic Reynolds number of R_m \sim 120. The critical rate of jets
necessary for the dynamo self-excitation is predicted from the calculations to
be a pair of plumes every 4 revolutions of the outer cylinder. For reasonable
technical limitations on the strength of materials and the power of the drive,
the self-excitation of the dynamo appears to be feasible.

D65 (2002) 085045","10.1103/PhysRevD.65.085045","UCLA/01/TEP/35","hep-th",,"  In this paper we further explore the question of topological charge in the
center vortex-nexus picture of gauge theories. Generally, this charge is
locally fractionalized in units of 1/N for gauge group SU(N), but globally
quantized in integral units. We show explicitly that in d=4 global topological
charge is a linkage number of the closed two-surface of a center vortex with a
nexus world line, and relate this linkage to the Hopf fibration, with homotopy
$\Pi_3(S^3)\simeq Z$; this homotopy insures integrality of the global
topological charge. We show that a standard nexus form used earlier, when
linked to a center vortex, gives rise naturally to a homotopy $\Pi_2(S^2)\simeq
Z$, a homotopy usually associated with 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles and similar
objects which exist by virtue of the presence of an adjoint scalar field which
gives rise to spontaneous symmetry breaking. We show that certain integrals
related to monopole or topological charge in gauge theories with adjoint
scalars also appear in the center vortex-nexus picture, but with a different
physical interpretation. We find a new type of nexus which can carry
topological charge by linking to vortices or carry d=3 Chern-Simons number
without center vortices present; the Chern-Simons number is connected with
twisting and writhing of field lines, as the author had suggested earlier. In
general, no topological charge in d=4 arises from these specific static
configurations, since the charge is the difference of two (equal) Chern-Simons
number, but it can arise through dynamic reconnection processes. We complete
earlier vortex-nexus work to show explicitly how to express globally-integral
topological charge as composed of essentially independent units of charge 1/N.

model is the integrable model for particular kind of the background fields. It
is shown, that bihamiltonity is origin of two types of the T-duality of the
closed string models. The dual nonlocal Poisson brackets, depending of the
background fields and of their derivatives, are obtained. The integrability
condition is formulated as the compatibility of the bihamoltonity condition and
the Jacobi identity of the dual Poisson bracket. It is shown, that the dual
brackets and dual hamiltonians can be obtained from the canonical (PB) and from
the initial hamiltonian by imposing of the second kind constraints on the
initial dynamical system, on the closed string model in the constant background
fields, as example. The closed string model in the constant background fields
is considered without constraints, with the second kind constraints and with
first kind constraints as the B-chiral string. The two particles discrete
closed string model is considered as two relativistic particle system to show
the difference between the Gupta-Bleuler method of the quantization with the
first kind constraints and the quantization of the Dirac bracket with the
second kind constraints.
