detected to radii over 16' or 4 R_25, and M_HI=6.44x10^8 M_sun. The total HI
map has a comet-like appearance suggesting that HoII is affected by ram
pressure from an intragroup medium (IGM). A rotation curve corrected for
asymmetric drift was derived and an analysis of the mass distribution yields a
total mass 6.3x10^9 M_sun, of which about 80% is dark. HoII lies northeast of
the M81 group's core, along with Kar52 (M81dwA) and UGC4483. No signs of
interaction are observed and it is argued that HoII is part of the NGC2403
subgroup, infalling towards M81. A case is made for ram pressure stripping and
an IGM in the M81 group. Stripping of the disk outer parts would require an IGM
density n_IGM>=4.0x10^-6 atoms/cm^3 at the location of HoII. This corresponds
to 1% of the virial mass of the group uniformly distributed over a volume just
enclosing HoII and is consistent with the X-ray properties of small groups. It
is argued that existing observations of HoII do not support self-propagating
star formation scenarios, whereby the HI holes and shells are created by
supernova explosions and stellar winds. Many HI holes are located in low
surface density regions of the disk, where no star formation is expected or
observed. Ram pressure has the capacity to enlarge preexisting holes and lower
their creation energies, helping to bridge the gap between the observed star
formation rate and that required to create the holes. (abridged)

Observatory (CGRO) and BeppoSAX to study the variation in the MeV gamma-ray
emission between the hard and soft spectral states, using spectra that cover
the energy range 20 keV up to 10 MeV. These data provide evidence for
significant spectral variability at energies above 1 MeV. In particular,
whereas the hard X-ray flux decreases during the soft state, the flux at
energies above 1 MeV increases, resulting in a significantly harder gamma-ray
spectrum at energies above 1 MeV. This behavior is consistent with the general
picture of galactic black hole candidates having two distinct spectral forms at
soft gamma-ray energies. These data extend this picture, for the first time, to
energies above 1 MeV. We have used two different hybrid thermal/non-thermal
Comptonization models to fit broad band spectral data obtained in both the hard
and soft spectral states. These fits provide a quantitative estimate of the
electron distribution and allow us to probe the physical changes that take
place during transitions between the low and high X-ray states. We find that
there is a significant increase (by a factor of ~4) in the bolometric
luminosity as the source moves from the hard state to the soft state.
Furthermore, the presence of a non-thermal tail in the Comptonizing electron
distribution provides significant constraints on the magnetic field in the
source region.

this has risen and fallen as more and more data has become available from

In the inner region of the cluster (r<1 r_h = 1.6 r_c) the binary fraction
(f_b) lies in the range 0.08--0.38 regardless of the assumed distribution of
mass ratios, F(q). The most probable f_b lies between 0.10 and 0.20 depending

must be less than 0.10, and the most likely value is 0.0, independently of the
adopted F(q). The detected population of binaries is dominated by primordial
systems. The specific frequency of Blue Straggler Stars (BSS) is exceptionally
high, suggesting that the BSS production mechanism via binary evolution can be
very efficient. A large population of BSS is possible even in low density
environments if a sufficient reservoir of primordial binaries is available. The
observed distribution of BSS in the Color Magnitude Diagram is not compatible
with a rate of BSS production which has been constant in time, if it is assumed

field of A3128/A3125, when combined with the Chandra image of A3128, reveals a
variety of substructures present in the galaxy distribution and in the hot ICM.
The most striking large-scale feature in the galaxy distribution is an
underpopulated redshift zone ~4000 km/s on either side of the cluster velocity
at ~17500 km/s. We attribute this depletion zone to the effect of the extensive
Horologium-Reticulum Supercluster (HRS), within which A3128/A3125 is embedded.
In addition, numerous smaller groups of galaxies are identified, particularly
in the underpopulated region within +-4000 km/s of the cluster redshift. Due to
the large gravitational influence of the HRS, these groups arrive at A3128 with
a very high (hypersonic) infall velocity. Two of these groups appear as
elongated filaments in position-velocity diagrams, indicating that they are
tidally distended groups which have been disrupted after a close passage
through A3128. We have identified a primary NE-SW merger axis connecting A3128
with A3125, along which the filaments are also oriented. In addition, the
Chandra image reveals that the X-ray emission is split into two components,
each with very small core radii, that are separated by ~1 Mpc along the NE-SW
axis. We propose that the complex X-ray morphology is likely the result of the
hypersonic infall of a relatively small group into A3128. The group produces a

a two-level system, interacting with two-level systems (spins) through a
spin-spin interaction and prove that coherent spin states of the conduction
electron are obtained in the strong coupling regime, when the number of the
spins is taken to be, formally, infinitely large (thermodynamic limit). This
model describes a spin interacting with a spin-bath in a strong coupling regime
and gives a dephasing time at zero temperature that agrees with the recent
experimental results for quantum dots. Dephasing is proved to occur as the
conduction electron oscillates between the two states with frequency going to
infinity in the thermodynamic limit, that is, increasing the number of spins.
Then, it is shown that the only meaning that can be attached to such
oscillations with infinite frequency is by an average in time, eliminating the
off-diagonal terms of the density matrix. This model is in agreement with a
recent proposal of appearance of classical states in quantum mechanics due to
the large number of components of a quantum system, if properly prepared for
the states of each component part. The strong coupling study of the model is

atomic force microscopy (AFM), and the surface morphology was studied by
numerical scaling analysis. The templated gels were formed by polymerizing
acrylamide plus a cross-linker in the presence of surfactants, which were then
removed by soaking in distilled water. Gels formed in the presence of over 20%
surfactant (by weight) formed clear, but became opaque upon removal of the
surfactants. Untemplated gels formed and remained clear. The surface morphology
of the gels was studied by several one- and two-dimensional numerical scaling
methods. The surfaces were found to be self-affine on short length scales, with
a roughness (Hurst) exponent in the range 0.85 to 1, crossing over to a
constant root-mean-square surface width on long scales. Both the crossover
length between these two regimes and the saturation value of the surface width
increased significantly with increasing surfactant concentration, coincident
with the increase in opacity. We propose that the changes in the surface
morphology are due to a percolation transition in the system of voids formed
upon removal of the surfactants from the bulk.

molecular dynamics simulations of glasses one observes that both low frequency
resonant vibrations and atomic jumps are centered on more than 10 atoms which,
in densely packed materials, form chainlike structures. With increasing
temperature the number of atoms jumping collectively increases. These chains of
collectively jumping atoms are also seen in undercooled liquids. Collectivity

to the dynamic heterogeneity which causes a non-Gaussianity of the atomic
displacements.

neutrinos and antineutrinos. Such a CPT violating scheme is able to account for
all neutrino data with the three known flavors. For atmospheric neutrinos this
means that it is possible to have different mass squared differences driving
the oscillation for neutrinos and antineutrinos. We analyze the atmospheric and
K2K data within the simplest scheme of two neutrino oscillation, neglecting
electron neutrino oscillation. We find that the preferred region is close to
the CPT conserving mass spectra. However the spectra with the antineutrino mass
squared difference about or larger than 0.1 eV^2 and the neutrino mass squared
difference about 2 \times 10^{-3} eV^2 is not significantly disfavored. In this
parameter region the atmospheric data are independent of the antineutrino mass
squared difference. Therefore no useful constraint can be put on CPT violation
effects contributing to different masses for the neutrinos and antineutrinos.

is broken at low energy scales and transmitted to visible matter by gauge

superfields of the MSSM are localized to a brane in a higher dimensional space
while the messenger fields and the sector which breaks supersymmetry
dynamically are localized to another brane in the same space. The MSSM gauge
and Higgs fields are assumed to propagate in the bulk. If some of the messenger
fields and the Higgs fields have the same quantum numbers, this allows the
possibility of mixing between these fields so that the physical Higgs and
messenger fields are admixtures of the brane and bulk fields. This manifests
itself in direct couplings of the quark and lepton fields to the physical
messengers that are proportional to the MSSM Yukawa couplings and hence
preserve the flavor structure of the CKM matrix. The result is new
contributions to the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters that are related to
the Yukawa couplings and which therefore naturally satisfy the constraints from
FCNC's. For messenger scales greater then 1000 TeV these new contributions are
parametrically of the same order of magnitude as gauge mediation. This scenario
naturally avoids the cosmological problems associated with stable messengers
and admits a simple and natural solution to the $\mu$ problem based on the
NMSSM.

point in brane world scenarios is that the system of four dimensional effective
gravitational equations is not closed due to bulk gravitational waves and bulk
scalars. Nonetheless, weak gravity on the brane can be analyzed completely. We
revisit the theory of weak brane gravity using gauge-invariant gravitational
and scalar perturbations around a background warped geometry with a bulk scalar
between two flat branes. We obtain a simple condition for the radion
stabilization in terms of the scalar field potentials. We show that for general
potentials of the scalar field which provides radion stabilization and a
general conformal transformation to a frame in which matter on the branes are
minimally coupled to the metric, 4-dimensional Einstein gravity, not BD
gravity, is restored at low energies on either brane. In contrast, in RS brane
world scenario without a bulk scalar, low energy gravity is BD one. We
conjecture that in general brane world scenarios with more than one scalar
field, one will again encounter the situation that low energy gravity is not
described by the Einstein theory. Equipped with the weak gravity results, we
discuss the properties of 4d brane gravitational equations, in particular, the
value and sign of 4d Newton's gravitational coupling.

nearest-neighbor particle jump processes, e.g. the simple exclusion or the zero

We use martingale technique and coupling methods to show that, rescaled by
time, the variance of the growth as seen by a deterministic moving observer has
the form |V-C|*D, where V and C is the speed of the observer and the second
class particle, respectively, and D is a constant connected to the equilibrium
distribution of the model. Our main result is a generalization of Ferrari and
Fontes' result for simple exclusion process. Law of large numbers and central

known for zero range processes, and which are proven here for a type of

ideal model system of molecular evolution where genotype, phenotype, and
fitness can be explicitly and independently characterized. In this theoretical
study, we construct an explicit model for the evolution of regulatory
sequences, making use of the known biophysics of the binding of regulatory
proteins to DNA sequences, under the assumption that fitness of a sequence
depends only on its binding affinity to the regulatory protein. The model is
confined to the mean field (i.e., infinite population size) limit. Using
realistic values for all parameters, we determine the minimum fitness advantage
needed to maintain a binding sequence, demonstrating explicitly the ``error
threshold'' below which a binding sequence cannot survive the accumulated
effect of mutation over long time. The commonly observed ``fuzziness'' in
binding motifs arises naturally as a consequence of the balance between
selection and mutation in our model. In addition, we devise a simple model for
the evolution of multiple binding sequences in a given regulatory region. We
find the number of evolutionarily stable binding sequences to increase in a
step-like fashion with increasing fitness advantage, if multiple regulatory
proteins can synergistically enhance gene transcription. We discuss possible
experimental approaches to resolve open questions raised by our study.
