breaking magnetic confinement and evolving in open space. We explore this
hypothesis with hydrodynamic simulations of flares occurring in a non-confined
corona: model flares are triggered by a transient impulsive heating injected in
a plane-parallel stratified corona. The plasma evolution is described by means
of a numerical 2-D model in cylindrical geometry R,Z. We explore the space of
fundamental parameters. As a reference model, we consider a flare triggered by
a heating pulse that would cause a 20 MK flare if delivered in a 40000 km long
closed loop. The modeled plasma evolution is described. The X-ray emission,
spectra and light curves at the ASCA/SIS focal plan, and in two intense X-ray
lines (Mg XI at 9.169 A and Fe XXI at 128.752 A), have been synthesized from
the models. The results are discussed and compared to features of confined
events, and scaling laws are derived. The light curves invariably show a very
rapid rise, a constant phase as long as the constant heating is on, and then a
very fast decay, on time scales of few seconds, followed by a more gradual one
(few minutes). We show that this evolution of the emission, and especially the
fast decay, together with other potentially observable effects, are intrinsic
to the assumption of non-confinement. Their lack indicates that observed
long-lasting stellar X-ray flares should involve plasma strongly confined by
magnetic fields.

  Bursts"", held in Amsterdam, june 6-8, 2001",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We discuss three classes of x-ray transients to highlight three new types of
transients found with the Wide Field Cameras onboard BeppoSAX. First there are
the transients related to Low Mass X-ray Binaries in outburst, typically
lasting weeks to months and reaching luminosities of the Eddington limit for a
few solar masses. Recently another subclass of outbursts in such binaries has
been discovered, which are an order of magnitude fainter and last shorter than
typical hours to days. We discuss whether they constitute a separate subset of
x-ray binaries.
  A second class of x-ray transients are the x-ray bursts. Thermonuclear
explosions on a neutron star (type I x-ray bursts) usually last of order
minutes or less. We discovered a second type (called super x-ray bursts) with a
duration of several hours. They relate to thermonuclear detonations much deeper
in the neutron star atmosphere, possibly burning on the nuclear ashes of normal
x-ray bursts.
  The third class are the enigmatic Fast X-ray Transients occurring at all
galactic latitudes. We found that the bright ones are of two types only: either
nearby coronal sources (lasting hours) or the socalled x-ray flashes (lasting
minutes). The new class, the X-ray flashes, may be a new type of cosmic
explosion, intermediate between supernovae and gamma ray bursts, or they may be
highly redshifted gamma ray bursts.
  It thus appears that the three classes of x-ray transients each come in two
flavors: long and short.

on Fermi acceleration theory at relativistic shocks shows that a particle
spectral index of 2.2-2.3, compatible with the X-ray spectra of plerions,
results under a wide variety of assumptions. If pulsar winds contain ions as
well as electrons and positrons, the mechanism of Hoshino et al. (1992), which
yields harder spectra, would operate at lower energies and may explain the flat
radio spectral indices of plerions. This scenario implies wind parameters in
the Crab compatible with the pulsar wind acceleration model of Lyubarsky & Kirk

waves demonstrate that the passage of the reverse shock rapidly compresses the
plerion. Using a simple isobaric model, we investigate the influence of the
resulting magnetic field compression and decrease in shock radius on the
evolution of the plerion spectrum. We suggest that the passage of the reverse

the increase in 3C 58's radio flux.

Though they are no longer fashionable we investigate the consequences if a
significant number of SNe Ia were edge-lit detonations (ELDs) of carbon/oxygen
white dwarfs that have accreted a critical mass of helium. Our best
understanding of the Phillips relation between light curve speed and peak
luminosity assigns both these phenomena to the amount of $^{56}$Ni produced. In
ELDs there are two sites of $^{56}$Ni synthesis. If the peak luminosity is
determined primarily by the C/O ratio in the core it is primarily a function of
its progenitor's initial mass. If the light curve decay speed is determined by
the total mass of iron group elements ejected this is a function of the total
mass of the ELD at the time of explosion. In general these two masses are
correlated and an empirical relation between peak luminosity and light curve
shape can be expected. However when we perform population synthesis for
progenitors of different metallicities we find a systematic shift in this
relation that would make distant SNe Ia fainter than those nearby. The
abundances of alpha-rich isotopes, such as $^{44}$Ca, in the solar system
indicate that only about 40 per cent of SNe Ia are edge-lit so any systematic
effect that could be present would be correspondingly diluted. If we examine
only the small subset of ELDs that accrete from a naked helium star, rather
than a He white dwarf, the systematic effect disappears.

events, 15 show detectable impulsive looptop emission. Considering that the
finite dynamic range (about a decade) of the detection introduces a strong bias
against observing comparatively weak looptop sources, we conclude that looptop
emission is a common feature of all flares. We summarize the observations of
the footpoint to looptop flux ratio and the spectral indices. We present light

possible we present results for individual pulses in multipeak flares and for
different loops for multiloop flares. We then discuss the statistics of the

Doppler shifts due to supersonic motions contain information on turbulent
velocity field which is otherwise difficult to obtain. However, the problem of
separation of velocity and density fluctuations within HI data cubes is far
from being trivial. Analytical description of the emissivity statistics of
channel maps (velocity slices) in Lazarian & Pogosyan (2000) showed that the
relative contribution of the density and velocity fluctuations depends on the
thickness of the velocity slice. In particular, power-law assymptotics of the
emissivity fluctuations change when the dispersion of the velocity at the scale
under study becomes of the order of the velocity slice thickness (integrated
width of the channel map). These results are the foundations of the
Velocity-Channel Analysis (VCA) technique which allows to determine velocity
and density statistics using 21-cm data cubes. The VCA has been successfully
tested using data cubes obtained via compressible magnetohydrodynamic
simulations and applied to Galactic and Magellanic Clouds data. As a tool it
has become much more sophisticated recently when effects of absorption were
accounted for. The systematic studies of vast 21-cm data sets to correlate the
variations in the turbulence statistics with the astrophysical activity is on
the agenda. This should allow to determine the interstellar energy injection
mechanisms. Going beyond the VCA, we discuss other tools, namely, genus and
anisotropy analysis. The first characterises the topology of HI, while the
second provides magnetic field directions. We show a few applications of these
new tools to HI data and MHD simulations.

While previous reports state that GaMnAs layers thinner than 50 \AA are
paramagnetic in the whole Mn composition range achievable using MBE growth (up
to 8% Mn), we have found that short period superlattices exhibit a
paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition with a transition temperature
which depends on both the thickness of the magnetic GaMnAs layer and the
nonmagnetic GaAs spacer. The neutron scattering experiments have shown that the

At low temperature, the ability of quasiparticles to transport heat is strictly
given by their ability to transport charge, via a universal relation known as
the Wiedemann-Franz law, which no material in nature has been known to violate.
High-temperature superconductors have long been thought to fall outside the

this has yet to be shown conclusively. Here we report on the first experimental

interaction (V_c > 2|t|) only above which does the ...1010... state become the
ground state; 2) Hartree-Fock mean field theory predicts V_c incorrectly; 3)

deviations to the Friedmann equation. These modifications are well motivated in
the context of brane cosmology where they appear without being in conflict with
major experimental constraints on four-dimensional gravity. While suppressed at
the time of nucleosynthesis, these corrections can dominate at the time of the
electroweak phase transition and in certain cases provide the amount of
expansion needed to freeze out the baryon asymmetry without requiring a
strongly first order phase transition. The sphaleron bound is substantially
weakened and can even disappear so that the constraints on the higgs and stop
masses do not apply anymore. Such modification of cosmology at early times
therefore reopens the parameter space allowing electroweak baryogenesis which
had been reduced substantially given the new bound on the higgs mass imposed by
LEP. In contrast with previous attempts to turn around the sphaleron bound
using alternative cosmologies, we are still considering that the electroweak
phase transition takes place in a radiation dominated universe. The universe is
expanding fast because of the modification of the Friedmann equation itself
without the need for a scalar field and therefore evading the problem of the
decay of this scalar field after the completion of the phase transition and the
risk that its release of entropy dilutes the baryon asymmetry produced at the
transition.

arbitrarily short. This contrasts with the standard (inflationary) situation
where the transition between two eras with different values of the equation of
state can be considered as instantaneous. We then argue that the usually
conserved quantities are not constant on a typical bounce time scale. Finally,

similar results are obtained. We conclude that the full dynamical equations of

ratios of particle abundances measured in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion

at BNL AGS, CERN SPS, and BNL RHIC. A very good description is achieved for
Pb+Pb collisions at SPS, and for Au+Au collisions at RHIC. In these two cases
the value of the temperature characterizing the chemical freeze-out is
practically same: T=168 MeV at SPS and T=165 MeV at RHIC. On the other hand,
the particle ratios measured in the collisions of lighter nuclei are described
only in the qualitative way. We discuss also the effect of the possible
in-medium modifications of hadron masses and widths on the thermal fits. For
Pb+Pb collisions at SPS and Au+Au collisions at RHIC we find that the chi^2
fits favor slightly a moderate (20%) decrease of the masses. In-medium
modifications of the widths have little effect on the fits, unless they are
increased by a factor larger than 2. We study in detail the thermodynamic
conditions characterizing the chemical freeze-out. In particular, we find that
the average baryon energy is 1.6 GeV and the average meson energy is 0.9 GeV.
This difference reflects a different behavior of the mass spectra of mesons and
baryons.

yield ratios with the third component of the fragment isospin (N-Z)/2 is
observed in all reactions, with scaling parameters that depend on the incident
energy. Breakup temperatures for these reactions are deduced from double ratios
of isotopic yields and tested for their relation with the isoscaling
parameters. The quantum statistical (QSM) and the statistical
multifragmentation (SMM) models are used for interpreting the results. The
observed isoscaling can be understood as a consequence of a statistical origin
of the emitted fragments in these reactions. The SMM analysis shows that the
exponent describing the isoscaling behavior is proportional to the strength of
the symmetry term of the fragment binding energy. Using this result, a
symmetry-term coefficient (approximately 22.5 MeV) for fragments at breakup is
deduced from the experimental data. This is close to the standard value and
supports SMM assumptions for the breakup configuration. An alternative method
of determining the symmetry-energy coefficient, by using isotope distribution
widths, is also discussed.
