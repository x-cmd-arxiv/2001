curve of V1405 Aql, a low mass X-ray Binary (LMXRB), has attracted the
attention of many observers. Two basic competing models have been offered for
this system. According to the first, V1405 Aql is a triple system. The second
model invokes the presence of an accretion disc that precesses in the apsidal
plane, suggesting that the shorter period is the orbital period while the
longer is a positive superhump. The debate on the nature of V1405 Aql has been
continued until very recently. Re-examination of previously published X-ray
data reveals an additional periodicity of 2979 s, which is naturally
interpreted as a negative superhump. The recently found 4.8-d period is
consequently understood as the nodal precession of the disc. This is the first
firm detection of negative superhumps and nodal precession in a LMXRB. Our
results thus confirm the classification of V1405 Aql as a permanent superhump
system. The 14-year argument on the nature of this intriguing object has thus
finally come to an end. We find that the ratio between the negative superhump
deficit (over the orbital period) and the positive superhump excess is a
function of orbital period in systems that show both types of superhumps. This
relation presents some challenge to theory as it fits binaries with different
components. We propose that a thickening in the disc rim, which causes
increased occultation of the X-ray source, is the mechanism responsible for
both types of superhumps in LMXRBs. According to our model superhumps (both in
the X-ray and optical regimes) are permitted in high inclination LMXRBs
contrary to Haswell et al. (2001) prediction.

spectral density, detrended fluctuation analysis, and multifractal analysis.

numerically and point out that we can search new interactions using some
channels, for example $\nu_{\mu} \to \nu_{\mu}$, in these experiments. We also
discuss several models which induce the effective interactions interfering with
the weak interaction, and show that some new physics effects are large enough
to be observed in the oscillation enhanced way.

that their moments are good measures of complexity of many-body quantum states.
Our construction of the Husimi distribution is based on the coherent state of
the single-particle transformation group. Then the coherent states are
independent-particle states, and, at the same time, the most localized states
in the Husimi representation. Therefore delocalization of the Husimi
distribution, which can be measured by the moments, is a sign of many-body
correlation (entanglement). Since the delocalization of the Husimi distribution
is also related to chaoticity of the dynamics, it suggests a relation between
entanglement and chaos. Our definition of the Husimi distribution can be
applied not only to the systems of distinguishable particles, but also to those
of identical particles, i.e., fermions and bosons. We derive an algebraic
formula to evaluate the moments of the Husimi distribution.

asymmetric and somewhat narrower in general; ii) the concept of quasimomentum
