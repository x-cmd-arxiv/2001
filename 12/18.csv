Keplerian circumbinary (CB) disk, using detailed models of their

the evolution of the cataclysmic binary and focus on cases where the
circumbinary disk causes accelerated mass transfer (> 1e-8 Msun/yr). The inner
edge of the disk is assumed to be determined by the tidal truncation radius and
the mass input rate into the disk is assumed to be a small fraction (1e-5-0.01)
of the mass transfer rate. Under the action of the viscous stresses in the disk
the matter drifts outward with the optically thick region extending to several
AU. The inner part of the disk is cool with maximum effective temperatures <
3,000 K while the outermost parts of the disk are < 30 K and optically thin. We
calculate the effects of thermal instability on a sufficiently massive CB disk.
It leads to outbursts reminiscent of those in thermally unstable accretion
disks, with the instability remaining confined to the inner regions of the CB
disk. However, for most of the evolutionary sequences the surface densities
required to trigger instability are not reached. The spectral energy
distributions from circumbinary disks are calculated, and the prospects for the
detection of such disks in the infrared and submm wavelength regions are
discussed.

footprints in the linear and circular polarized radiation of the source. An
important factor is also the magnetic field structure, which can be
characterized in most cases by a global magnetic field and a turbulent
component. We present the basic radiative transfer coefficients for polarized
synchrotron radiation and apply them to the standard jet model for relativistic
radio jets. The model can successfully explain the unusual circular and linear
polarization of the Galactic Centre radio source Sgr A* and its sibling M81*.
It also can account for the circular polarization found in jets of more
luminous quasars and X-ray binaries. The high ratio of circular to linear
polarization requires the presence of a significant fraction of hidden matter
and low-energy electrons in these jets. The stable handedness of circular
polarization requires stable global magnetic field components with
non-vanishing magnetic flux along the jet, while the low degree of total
polarization implies also a significant turbulent field. The most favoured
magnetic field configuration is that of a helix, while a purely toroidal field
is unable to produce significant circular polarization. If connected to the
magnetosphere of the black hole, the circular polarization and the jet
direction determine the magnetic poles of the system which is stable over long
periods of time. This may also have implications for possible magnetic field
configurations in accretion flows.

companion is most likely substellar, with a mass of 55-78 Mjup based on

and we combine the radial velocity data and AO imaging to set a firm
(model-independent) lower limit of 48 Mjup. In contrast to the paucity of brown
dwarf companions at <~4 AU around FGK dwarfs, HR 7672B implies that brown dwarf
companions do exist at separations comparable to those of the giant planets in
our own solar system. Its presence is at variance with scenarios where brown

should induce the Faraday rotation effect on the linearly polarized cosmic
microwave background (CMB) radiation when the CMB radiation propagates through
a cluster at low redshift. Employing the Press-Schechter prescription for the
cluster abundance under the cold dark matter (CDM) scenario and a plausible
isothermal $\beta$-model for the gas distribution, we compute angular power
spectra of the CMB polarization fields including the Faraday rotation mixing
effect under the simple assumption of uniform magnetic field configuration
across a cluster. As a result, we find that a parity-odd B-type polarization
pattern is statistically generated on the observed sky, even when the primary
polarization only contains the parity-even E-mode component, such as in the
case of pure scalar perturbations. The generated B-type polarization has a peak
with amplitude of $\sim0.1 \mu{\rm K}(B_0/0.1 \mu{\rm G})(\nu_0/10 {\rm
GHz})^{-2}$ at angular scales of $l\approx 1000$ for the currently favored
adiabatic $\Lambda$CDM model. This result also implies that, if the magnetic
field has a $0.5 \mu{\rm G}$ strength and we observe at lower frequencies such
as $\nu_0\simlt 5 {\rm GHz}$, the secondary signal due to the Faraday rotation
effect could be comparable to the magnitude of the primary polarization. The
frequency dependence of the Faraday rotation can be then used to discriminate
the effect from primary and other secondary signals on the CMB polarizations.
Our results therefore offer a new empirical opportunity to measure or constrain
the intracluster magnetic field in the average sense.

us to study the spectral time evolution on timescales down to ~10sec. The mean
UV spectra are characterised by the wind signature of broad blueshifted
absorption in Lya, NV1240, SiIV1398, CIV1549 and HeII1640. There is very little

disappearing in one epoch of observation of IX Vel. The strong positive

colour-intensity plots, cross-correlation functions and phase-lag diagrams to

that the PDS are not flat but consistent with a power-law of index ~-1. This is
the same slope as that found in the power spectra of Cyg X-1 during the soft
state. In fact, the power spectrum of Cyg X-1 in the frequency range
10^{-7}-10^{-5} Hz appears as a continuation of the 10^{-3}-10 Hz power
spectrum during the soft state. Significant variability, expressed as the
fractional rms in the frequency range 2 x 10^{-7}-1 x 10^{-5} Hz, is detected
at a level of 27% and 21% for GRS 1915+105 and Cyg X-1, respectively. Our
results confirm previous suggestions that the innermost regions of the
accretion disc are affected by variations occurring at larger radii from the
black hole, presumably due to changes in the mass accretion rate. We also
observe strong spectral changes: in Cyg X--1 the spectrum softens as the flux
increases when it is in the low/hard state, and hardens with increasing flux in
the high/soft state. GRS 1915+105 follows the same trend as Cyg X-1 in the soft
state, but the hardness ratios show a larger amplitude of variation. The
cross-correlation shows that the variations occur simultaneously in all energy
bands. However, the cross-correlation functions are asymmetric toward negative
lags. The phase spectrum also reveals negative lags at periods larger than a
few days, suggesting that the long term variations in the soft energy band are
delayed with respect to the harder bands.

analytical approaches are used. Two new phenomena are found: (i) the display of

(ii) the recovery of full shot noise for asymptotic high applied bias. The
first phenomenon is associated with the onset of negative differential
conductivity in energy space that drives the system towards a dynamical
electrical instability in excellent agreement with analytical predictions. The
enhancement is found to be strongly amplified when the dimensionality in
momentum space is lowered from 3 to 2 dimensions. The second phenomenon is due
to the suppression of the effects of long range Coulomb correlations that takes
place when the transit time becomes the shortest time scale in the system, and
is common to both elastic and inelastic nondegenerate diffusive conductors.
These phenomena shed new light in the understanding of the anomalous behavior
of shot noise in mesoscopic conductors, which is a signature of correlations
among different current pulses.

represented by lattice Wannier functions, which are in turn used to construct
an effective Hamiltonian. When the low-pressure structure becomes metastable
with respect to the high-pressure equilibrium phase and the relevant branches
are sufficiently flat, transformation into an amorphous phase is shown to be
kinetically favored because of the exponentially large number of both amorphous
phases and reaction pathways. In effect, the critical-size nucleus for the

fields, supersymmetry breaking is naturally mediated in a variety of ways.
Absent other light fields in the theory, gravity will mediate supersymmetry
breaking through the conformal anomaly. If gauge fields propagate in the extra
dimension they, too, can mediate supersymmetry breaking effects. The presence
of gauge fields in the bulk motivates us to consider the effects of new
messenger fields with holomorphic and non-holomorphic couplings to the
supersymmetry breaking sector. These can lead to contributions to the soft
masses of MSSM fields which dramatically alter the features of brane world
scenarios of supersymmetry breaking. In particular, they can solve the negative
slepton mass squared problem of anomaly mediation and change the predictions of
gaugino mediation.

of rendering supernovae dimmer without cosmic acceleration. Subsequently, it
has been argued that the intergalactic plasma may interfere adversely with this
mechanism by rendering the oscillations energy dependent. Here we show that
this energy dependence is extremely sensitive to the precise value of the free
electron density in the Universe. Decreasing the electron density by only a
factor of 4 is already sufficient to bring the energy dependence within the
experimental bounds. Models of the intergalactic medium show that for redshifts
z<1 about 97% of the total volume of space is filled with regions of density
significantly lower than the average density. From these models we estimate
that the average electron density in most of space is lower by at least a
factor of 15 compared to the estimate based on one half of all baryons being
uniformly distributed and ionized. Therefore the energy dependence of the
photon-axion oscillations is consistent with experiment, and the oscillation
model remains a viable alternative to the accelerating Universe for explaining
the supernova observations. Furthermore, the electron density does give rise to
a sufficiently large plasma frequency which cuts off the photon-axion mixing
above microwave frequencies, shielding the cosmic microwave photons from axion
conversions and significantly relaxing the lower bounds on the axion mass
implied by the oscillation model.

brane-world scenarios. The idea is to start from a supersymmetric configuration
with two parallel static Dp-branes, and slightly break the supersymmetry
conditions to produce a very flat potential for the field that parametrises the
distance between the branes, i.e. the inflaton field. This breaking can be
achieved in various ways: by slight relative rotations of the branes with small
angles, by considering small relative velocities between the branes, etc. If
the breaking parameter is sufficiently small, a large number of e-folds can be
produced within the D-brane, for small changes of the configuration in the
compactified directions. Such a process is local, i.e. it does not depend very
strongly on the compactification space nor on the initial conditions. Moreover,
the breaking induces a very small velocity and acceleration, which ensures very
small slow-roll parameters and thus an almost scale invariant spectrum of
metric fluctuations, responsible for the observed temperature anisotropies in
the microwave background. Inflation ends as in hybrid inflation, triggered by
the negative curvature of the string tachyon potential. In this paper we
elaborate on one of the simplest examples: two almost parallel D4-branes in a
flat compactified space.

reaction-diffusion and convection-diffusion processes, respectively have
recently attracted a lot of attention in the context of chemical kinetics,
mathematical biology and turbulence. We show here that they admit exact
solutions. While the speed of the traveling wavefront is dependent on the
relaxation time in Fisher equation, memory effects significantly smoothen out
the shock wave nature of Burgers' solution, without making any influence on the
corresponding wave speed. We numerically analyze the ansatz for the exact

reaction term must be moderate enough not to exceed a critical limit to allow
travelling wave solution to exist for appreciable finite memory effect.

problems and adjoint spectral problems into so-called binary constrained flows,
which provide candidates for finite-dimensional Liouville integrable
Hamiltonian systems. The resulting constraints on the potentials of spectral
problems give rise to a kind of involutive solutions to zero curvature
equations, and thus the integrability by quadratures can be shown for zero
curvature equations once the corresponding binary constrained flows are proved
to be integrable. The whole process to carry out binary symmetry constraints is
called binary nonlinearization. The principal task of binary nonlinearization
is to expose the Liouville integrability for the resulting binary constrained
flows, which can usually be achieved as a consequence of the existence of
hereditary recursion operators. The theory of binary nonlinearization is
applied to the multi-wave interaction equations associated with a 4x4 matrix
spectral problem as an illustrative example. The Backlund transformations
resulted from symmetry constraints are given for the multi-wave interaction
equations, and thus a kind of involutive solutions is presented and the
integrability by quadratures is shown for the multi-wave interaction equations.
