general a multi-dimensional, non-axisymmetric problem, which is challenging to
solve. Here, I present a method of decomposing the radiative transfer equation
that describes absorption, emission, and Compton scattering in an obliquely
illuminated disk into a set of four one-dimensional transfer equations. I show
that the exact calculation of the ionization balance and radiation heating of
the accretion disk requires the solution of only one of the one-dimensional
equations, which can be solved using existing numerical methods. I present a
variant of the Feautrier method for solving the full set of equations, which
accounts for the fact that the scattering kernels in the individual transfer
equations are not forward-backward symmetric. I then apply this method in
calculating the albedo of a cold, geometrically thin accretion disk.

similar properties; the main difference between these two types of gas-rich
dwarf galaxies is that the current star formation is concentrated in the center
of the star bursting systems while it is much more distributed in the quiescent
dIs. This results in pronounced color gradients for the starbursting dwarf
galaxies, while the majority of the quiescent dwarf irregular galaxies have
minor or non-existent color gradients. Thus, the combination of low current
star formation rates, blue colors, and the lack of significant color gradients
indicates that star formation percolates slowly across the disk of normal dwarf
galaxies in a quasi-continuous manner.

natural sites for acceleration of charged particles. Powerful acceleration
mechanism due to unipolar induction is thought to operate in the magnetospheres
of isolated neutron stars, bringing the particles to ultrarelativistic energies
at the expense of the neutron star rotational energy, with inevitable emission
of high energy photons. The aim of this review is to present basic ingredients
of modern models of magnetospheric activity of rotation powered pulsars in the
context of high-energy radiation from these objects. Several aspects of pulsar
activity are addressed and related to spectacular results of pulsar
observations with two major satellite missions of the past - CGRO and ROSAT. It
is then argued that high sensitivity experiments of the future - GLAST, VERITAS
and MAGIC - will be vital for a progress in our understanding of pulsar
magnetospheric processes. In a conservative approach rotation powered pulsars
are not expected to be the sources of UHE Cosmic Rays. However, several
scenarios have been proposed recently to explain the UHECR events above the GZK
limit with the help of acceleration processes in the immediate surrounding of
newly born pulsars. Major features of these scenarios are reviewed along with
references to contemporary models of magnetospheric activity.

  When combined with previously identified, higher mass stars, this search
provides a sensitive measurement of the stellar mass function and dynamical

well with current N body simulation results. Tidal truncation affects masses
below ~ 1 M_sun. The cluster contains a total mass ~ 800 M_sun. Evidence for a
flatter mass function in the core than in the halo indicates the depletion of
stars in the core with mass less than ~ 0.5 M_sun, relative to stars with mass

observed to vary in intensity by factors of few, over timescales of days to
years. If the quiescent luminosity is powered by a hot NS core, the core
cooling timescale is much longer than the recurrence time, and cannot explain
the observed, more rapid variability. However, the non-equilibrium reactions
which occur in the crust during outbursts deposit energy in iso-density shells,
from which the thermal diffusion timescale to the photosphere is days to years.
The predicted magnitude of variability is too low to explain the observed
variability unless - as is widely believed - the neutrons beyond the
neutron-drip density are superfluid. Even then, variability due to this
mechanism in models with standard core neutrino cooling processes is less than
50 per cent - still too low to explain the reported variability. However,
models with rapid core neutrino cooling can produce variability by a factor as
great as 20, on timescales of days to years following an outburst. Thus, the

the gravitational collapse of small perturbations arising from quantum

to differentiate between these models on the basis of their statistical
properties; only in the former case is the initial density field an
almost-perfect random gaussian field. In this paper, we investigate the use of
the trispectrum of the galaxy density field, which is the connected four-point

related statistic $\tau$ which, as a test of the gaussian hypothesis, is
independent of cosmology, the power spectrum and biasing, in real space, and
which is, in principle, a measure of the departure from gaussian statistics.
For galaxy redshift surveys, the statistic depends on cosmology and bias only
through the potentially observable parameter $\beta$. We compute the expected

that it can be a useful discriminant of models, with the important proviso that
any bias is linear on large scales. Whether it is the most effective method is
uncertain and depends on the nature of the departure from gaussianity.

dust and as a result the comparatively faint galaxies that hosted most
high-redshift star formation are easiest to detect in the UV. The correlation
of star-formation rate and dust obscuration implies that extremely luminous
dusty galaxies are usually as bright in the UV as the less luminous dust-free
galaxies, and that any UV survey at a given redshift 0<z<~3 deep enough to
detect the majority of the UV luminosity density will detect the majority of
IR-selected galaxies as well. Little star formation occurs in galaxies that are
completely hidden from UV surveys. I review recent attempts to estimate
star-formation rates for high-redshift galaxies from UV data alone. The
strength of UV surveys is that they detect large numbers of high-redshift

difficult to estimate for the detected galaxies. IR surveys complement them
perfectly: star-formation rates can be estimated with reasonable confidence,

diffuse radiation from the intercluster medium (ICM) at radio, EUV and hard
x-ray (HXR) ranges. The radio radiation is due to synchrotron by relativistic
electrons, and the inverse Compton (IC) scattering by the cosmic microwave
background radiation of the same electrons is the most natural source for the
HXR and perhaps the EUV emissions. However, simple estimates give a weaker
magnetic field than that suggested by Faraday rotation measurements.
Consequently, non-thermal bremsstrahlung (NTB) and TB have also been suggested
as sources of these emissions. We show that NTB cannot be the source of the
HXRs and that the difficulty with the low magnetic field in the IC model is
alleviated if we take into account the effects of observational bias,
nonisotropic pitch angle distribution and spectral breaks. We derive a spectrum
for the radiating electrons and discuss acceleration scenarios. We show that
continuous and in situ acceleration in the ICM of the background thermal
electrons requires unreasonably high energy input and acceleration of injected
relativistic electrons gives rise to a much flatter spectrum than desired,
unless a large fraction of electrons escape the ICM, in which case one obtains
EUV and HXR emissions extending well beyond the boundaries of the cluster. A
continuous emission by a cooling spectrum resulting from interaction with ICM
of electrons accelerated elsewhere also suffers from similar shortcomings. The
most likely scenario appears to be an episodic injection-acceleration model,
whereby one obtains a time dependent spectrum that for certain phases of its

The morphology of the halo is dominated by two spatially resolved regions. Lya
is extended by >12 arcsec along the radio axis, CIV and HeII are extended by ~8
arcsec. The overall spectrum is typical for that of high redshift radio
galaxies. The most striking spatial variation is that NV is present in the
spectrum of the region associated with the center of the galaxy hosting the
radio source, the northern region, while absent in the southern region.
Assuming that the gas is photoionized by a hidden quasar, the difference in NV

consistent with a scenario in which the gas is associated with a massive
cooling flow or originates from the debris of the merging of two or more

extinction cannot reproduce the global relative intensities of H recombination

homogeneous mixture of dust and sources, and with a visual extinction of 52
mag. The SWS data provide evidence for deviations from commonly assumed
extinction laws between 3 and 10 micron. The fine-structure lines of Ne, Ar,

abundance ratios Ne/H and Ar/H nearly solar and S/H one-fourth solar. The
excitation of the ionized gas indicates an average temperature for the OB stars
of 37400 K, with little spatial variation. A random distribution of gas clouds
and ionizing clusters and an ionization parameter of about 10^{-2.3} represent
well the star-forming regions. From population synthesis and the

exists a significant (>97% likelihood) positive (rank) correlation between the
peak X-ray flux P_X and radio flux density P_R for the black hole candidate
(BHC) systems, and a marginally significant positive (rank) correlation for the
neutron star (NS) systems. This is further evidence for a coupling between
accretion and outflows in X-ray binary systems, in this case implying a
relation between peak disc-accretion-rate and the number of synchroton-emitting
electrons ejected. However, we also show that the distribution of `radio
loudness', P_R/P_X, is significantly different for the two samples, in the
sense that the BHCs generally have a higher ratio of P_R/P_X. The origin of
this discrepancy is uncertain, but probably reflects differences in the
energetics and/or radiative efficiency of flows around the neutron stars and
black holes; we briefly discuss some of these possibilities. We conclude that
these data point to the formation of a mildly relativistic jet whose luminosity
is a function of the accretion rate, in the majority, if not all, of X-ray

dependent on the nature of the accreting compact object. (Abridged).

the cluster radio galaxy database from Miller & Owen (2001) and optical
spectroscopy and high resolution radio images to remove AGN, we assess the
FIR/radio correlation of cluster galaxies from the centers of the clusters out
well past the classical Abell radius. The FIR/radio correlation is shown to
hold quite well for star forming galaxies, and the FIR and radio fluxes for
cluster AGN are also well correlated. In the case of AGN, the relative radio-
to-FIR fluxes are greater and the scatter in the correlation is larger than
those seen for star forming galaxies. We also find that there is a rare but
statistically significant excess of star forming galaxies with enhanced radio
emission in the centers of the clusters, and that the degree of this
enhancement is typically a factor of two or three. The FIR/radio correlation
for cluster star forming galaxies is also tested against line-of-sight velocity
relative to the cluster systemic velocities, but no significant correlation is
found. While the radial dependence of the FIR/radio correlation is consistent
with the model wherein ram pressure increases the cluster galaxies' magnetic
field strengths through compression, the velocity data do not confirm this
model. Although a contribution from ram pressure can not be ruled out, the
thermal pressure due to the ICM alone is an equally viable alternative. The
high resolution radio images largely reject the hypothesis that the increased
radio emission arises from an AGN component, strengthening the claim that the
change in the correlation is caused by a change in the environment of the
galaxies.

shown to obey an anomalous, logarithmic law $|\bar{{\bf X}}_n| = \alpha_0(|{\bf

the steady state in arbitrary dimensions, with and without bias. In the
thermodynamic limit, the system can exist in one of the following phases -- (a)
Pinned Aggregate (PA) phase in which an infinite aggregate (with mass
proportional to the volume of the system) appears with probability one at the
chipping site but not in the bulk. (b) Unpinned Aggregate (UA) phase in which
$\emph{both}$ the chipping site and the bulk can support an infinite aggregate
simultaneously. (c) Non Aggregate (NA) phase in which there is no infinite
cluster. Our analytical and numerical studies show that the system exists in
the UA phase in all cases except in 1d with bias. In the latter case, there is
a phase transition from the NA phase to the PA phase as density is increased. A
variant of the above aggregation model is also considered in which total
particle number is conserved and chipping occurs at a fixed site, but the
particles do not interact with each other at other sites. This model is solved
exactly by mapping it to a Zero Range Process. With increasing density, it
exhibits a phase transition from the NA phase to the PA phase in all
dimensions, irrespective of bias. Finally, we discuss the likely behaviour of
the system in the presence of extensive disorder.

Generally, spin is
considered to be the source of torsion, but there are several other
possibilities in which torsion emerges in different contexts. In some cases a
phenomenological counterpart is absent, in some other cases torsion arises from
sources without spin as a gradient of a scalar field. Accordingly, we propose
two classification schemes. The first one is based on the possibility to
construct torsion tensors from the product of a covariant bivector and a vector
and their respective space-time properties. The second one is obtained by
starting from the decomposition of torsion into three irreducible pieces. Their
space-time properties again lead to a complete classification. The
classifications found are given in a U_4, a four dimensional space-time where
the torsion tensors have some peculiar properties. The irreducible
decomposition is useful since most of the phenomenological work done for
torsion concerns four dimensional cosmological models. In the second part of
the paper two applications of these classification schemes are given. The
modifications of energy-momentum tensors are considered that arise due to
different sources of torsion. Furthermore, we analyze the contributions of
torsion to shear, vorticity, expansion and acceleration. Finally the
generalized Raychaudhuri equation is discussed.

to an effective Nambu-Goto behavior of such a string network in cosmology, i.e.
on very large scales. It is found also that on small scales, the energy per

anomaly mediation and gaugino mediation. There is then strong motivation for

plausible that the CKM matrix is the only source of flavor and CP violation.
Gauge mediation provides a concrete example. Approximate CP is then
unacceptable. Upcoming measurements of the CP asymmetry in B to \psi K_S might
