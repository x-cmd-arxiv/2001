  Series","Astrophys.J.Suppl.134:77-102,2001","10.1086/320358",,"astro-ph",,"  The X-ray emission from the central region of the Galactic plane, |l|<45 deg
and |b|<0.4 deg, was studied in the 0.7-10 keV energy band with a spatial
resolution of ~3' with the ASCA observatory. We developed a new analysis method
for the ASCA data to resolve discrete sources from the extended Galactic ridge
X-ray emission (GRXE). We resolved 163 discrete sources with a flux down to
10^-12.5 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 and determined the intensity variations of the GRXE as
a function of the Galactic longitude with a spatial resolution of ~1 deg. The
longitudinal variation of the GRXE in the energy band above 4 keV shows a large
enhancement within |l|<30 deg. This suggests a strong enhancement of X-ray
emissivity inside the 4-kpc arms. Searches for identifications of the resolved
sources with cataloged X-ray sources and optical stars show that the 66% are
unidentified. Spectral analysis of each source shows that a large number of the
unidentified sources have hard X-ray spectra. We classified the sources into
several groups according to the spectra and analyzed the spectra summed within
each group. Possible X-ray origins of these sources are discussed based on the
grouping analysis. Also, we derived the LogN-LogS relations of the resolved
sources in the energy bands below and above 2 keV. The obtained LogN-LogS
relation of the Galactic X-ray sources above 2 keV is represented by a
power-law with an index of -0.79+/-0.07. This flat LogN-LogS relation suggests
that the spatial distribution of the sources should have an arm-like structure
in which the Solar system is included. The integrated surface brightness of the
resolved sources is about 10% of the total GRXE in both energy bands. The
approximately 90% of the emission remaining is still unresolved.

eigenstates (normal modes) in the liquid; there are fewer localized states at
higher densities which we quantify by calculating the participation ratios of

quasi-particle energy gap of a bulk singlet superconductor are suppressed.
According to the conventional mean-field theory of Abrikosov and Gor'kov, the
integrity of the energy gap is maintained up to a critical concentration of
magnetic impurities. In this paper, a field theoretic approach is developed to
critically analyze the validity of the mean field theory. Using the
supersymmetry technique we find a spatially homogeneous saddle-point that
reproduces the Abrikosov-Gor'kov theory, and identify instanton contributions
to the density of states that render the quasi-particle energy gap soft at any
non-zero magnetic impurity concentration. The sub-gap states are associated
with supersymmetry broken field configurations of the action. An analysis of
fluctuations around these configurations shows how the underlying supersymmetry
of the action is restored by zero modes. An estimate of the density of states
is given for all dimensionalities. To illustrate the universality of the
present scheme we apply the same method to study `gap fluctuations' in a normal
quantum dot coupled to a superconducting terminal. Using the same instanton
approach, we recover the universal result recently proposed by Vavilov et al.
Finally, we emphasize the universality of the present scheme for the
description of gap fluctuations in d-dimensional superconducting/normal
structures.

  Chevalley Property","7 pages, latex",,,,"math.QA",,"  Recall that a triangular Hopf algebra A is said to have the Chevalley
property if the tensor product of any two simple A-modules is semisimple, or,
equivalently, if the radical of A is a Hopf ideal. There are two reasons to
study this class of triangular Hopf algebras: First, it contains all known
examples of finite-dimensional triangular Hopf algebras; second, it can be, in
a sense, ""completely understood"". Namely, it was shown in our previous work
with Andruskiewitsch that any finite-dimensional triangular Hopf algebra with
the Chevalley property is obtained by twisting of a finite-dimensional
triangular Hopf algebra with R-matrix of rank at most 2 which, in turn, is
obtained by ""modifying"" the group algebra of a finite supergroup. This provides
a classification of such Hopf algebras.
  The goal of this paper is to make this classification more effective and
explicit, i.e. to parameterize isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional
triangular Hopf algebras with the Chevalley property by group-theoretical
objects, similarly to how it was done in our previous work in the semisimple
case. This is achieved in Theorem 2.2, where these classes are put in bijection
with certain septuples of data. In the semisimple case, the septuples reduce to
the quadruples, and we recover the result of our previous paper. In the minimal
triangular pointed case, we recover a classification theorem from a previous
paper of the second author.
