mechanisms, a large-scale magnetic field introduces a new decaying tensor mode
and modifies the non-decaying mode. The direct effect of the magnetic field is
to damp the gravitational waves, while an indirect magneto-curvature effect can
either damp or boost the waves. A magnetic field also leads to a breaking of
statistical isotropy, and the magnetic imprint on the tensor spectrum in

cluster in a fairly narrow range from about 300 - 600 Hz, well below the

Between radii of 50-500 kpc, the cluster gas is approximately isothermal with
an emission-weighted temperature, kT ~5 keV. Within the central 50 kpc radius
this value drops to kT ~3.7 keV. The spectral and imaging Chandra data indicate
the presence of a cooling flow within the central 50 kpc radius of the cluster,
with a mass deposition rate of approximately 280 solar masses per year. We
estimate an age for the cooling flow of 1-2 Gyr, which is approximately one
thousand times older than the central radio source. We find no evidence in the
X-ray spectra or images for significant heating of the X-ray gas by the radio

accumulated by the cooling flow over its lifetime. Combining the results on the

a well defined sample is a distance indicator, the hard bursts must reside at
larger redshifts and therefore be more luminous than the soft bursts. The
resulting luminosity-hardness correlation cannot be shown explicitly due to the
small number of observed GRB redshifts at the present time. Based on the
<V/Vmax>-hardness correlation, we derive the luminosity function of GRBs
without using any redshifts, but we have to make an assumption how the comoving
GRB rate varies with redshift. We present luminosity functions for three models

preshock gas temperature affects the shock wave structure due to the

postshock relaxation processes are very sensitive to the number density of
hydrogen ions ahead the discontinuous jump. Both the increase of the preshock
gas temperature and the decrease of the preshock gas density lead to lower
postshock compression ratios. The width of the shock wave decreases with
increasing upstream velocity while the postshock gas is still partially ionized

over z ~ 1. It is not clear, however, the extent to which the selection of such
samples influences the measurement of this quantity. Using the Taurus Tunable
Filter (TTF) we have obtained an emission-line sample of faint star-forming
galaxies over comparable lookback times: the TTF Field Galaxy Survey. By
selecting through emission-lines, we are screening galaxies through a quantity
that scales directly with star-formation activity for a given choice of initial
mass function. The scanning narrowband technique furnishes a galaxy sample that
differs from traditional broadband-selected surveys in both its volume-limited
nature and selection of galaxies through emission-line flux. Three discrete
wavelength intervals are covered, centered at H-alpha redshifts z = 0.08, 0.24
and 0.39.
  Galaxy characteristics are presented and comparisons made with existing
surveys of both broadband and emission-line selection. When the number-counts
of emission-line objects are compared with those expected on the basis of
existing H-alpha surveys, we find an excess of ~ 3 times at the faintest
limits. While these detections are yet to be independently confirmed,
inspection of the stronger subsample of galaxies detected in both the line and
continuum (line-on-continuum subsample; 13 %) is sufficient to support an
excess population. This increase in the emission-line field population implies
higher star-formation densities over z ~ 0.4. However, further study in the
form of multi-object spectroscopic follow-up is necessary to quantify this and
confirm the faintest detections in the sample.

to check for systematics in the method and to sketch its limitations. For a

existence of these trailing components indicates that not all observed

multiple emission components can be generated by a single disturbance in the

homogeneous across the film due to the proximity effect. We use a proximity
effect model with two parameters (proximity strength and interface
transparency), which can also describe the dependence of the superconducting
transition temperature T_c on d_s. We compare the computations with the
experimentally determined zero-field critical current J_{c0} of small strips
(typically 5~ \mu m wide) of Fe/Nb/Fe trilayers with varying thickness d_{Nb}
of the Nb layer. Near T_c the temperature dependence J_{c0}(T) is in good
agreement with the expected behaviour, which allows extrapolation to T = 0.
Both the absolute values of J_{c0}(0) and the dependence on d_{Nb} agree with
the expectations for the depairing current. We conclude that J_{dp} is
correctly determined, notwithstanding the fact that the strip width is larger
than both the superconducting penetration depth and the superconducting
coherence length, and that J_{dp}(d_s) is correctly described by the model.

even number of electrons, using a scaling method and a mean field theory. We
evaluate the Kondo temperature $T_K$ as a function of the energy difference
between spin-singlet and triplet states in the dot, $\Delta$, and the Zeeman
splitting, $E_Z$. If the Zeeman splitting is small, $E_Z \ll T_K$, the
competition between the singlet and triplet states enhances the Kondo effect.
$T_K$ reaches its maximum around $\Delta=0$ and decreases with $\Delta$ obeying
a power law. If the Zeeman splitting is strong, $E_Z \gg T_K$, the Kondo effect
originates from the degeneracy between the singlet state and one of the
components of the triplet state at $-\Delta \sim E_Z$. We show that $T_K$
exhibits another power-law dependence on $E_Z$. The mean field theory provides
a unified picture to illustrate the crossover between these regimes. The
enhancement of the Kondo effect can be understood in terms of the overlap
between the Kondo resonant states created around the Fermi level. These
resonant states provide the unitary limit of the conductance $G\sim 2e^2/h$.

exponents have been considered - one provided by the usual (perturbative)
renormalization group (RG) theory, and another predicted by grouping of Feynman
diagrams in phi^4 model (our theory). The test consists of two steps. First we
determine the critical coupling by fitting the MC data to the theoretical
expression, including both confluent and analytical corrections to scaling, the
values of critical exponents being taken from theory. Then we use the obtained
value of critical coupling to test the agreement between theory and MC data at
criticality. As a result, we have found that predictions of our theory
(gamma=19/14, eta=1/10, omega=3/5) are consistent, whereas those of the
perturbative RG theory (gamma=1.3895, eta=0.0355, omega=0.782) are inconsistent
with the MC data. The seemable agreement between the RG prediction for eta and
MC results at criticality, reported in literature, appears due to slightly
overestimated value of the critical coupling. Estimation of critical exponents
of 3D Ising model from complex zeroth of the partition function is discussed. A
refined analysis yields the best estimate 1/nu=1.518. We conclude that the

investigate both the weak coupling and strong coupling case, as well as the
crossover regime between them. Two of the methods, which are presented here for
the first time, introduce interesting elements to the understanding of the
nature of the polaron. Reliable numerical evidence is found that, in the strong
coupling regime, the ground and the first excited state of the self-trapped
polaron are well described within the adiabatic limit. The lattice vibration
modes associated with the self-trapped polarons are analyzed in detail, and the
frequency softening of the vibration mode at the central site of the small
polaron is estimated. It is shown that the first excited state of the system in
the strong coupling regime corresponds to the excitation of the soft phonon
mode within the polaron. In the crossover regime, the ground and the first
excited state of the system can be approximated by the anticrossing of the
self-trapped and the delocalized polaron state. In this way, the connection
between the behavior of the ground and the first excited state is qualitatively
explained.

the typical energy of single particle excitations which is the temperature $T$.
We show that the plasma particles provide a source for long wavelength
oscillations of average fields which carry the quantum numbers of the plasma

particles obey simple gauge-covariant kinetic equations, whose derivation from
the general Dyson-Schwinger equations is outlined. As a by-product, the ``hard

that the collective excitations can be described in terms of classical fields,

the hard particles is also studied, in particular in relation with the
effective theory for ultrasoft excitations, with momenta $\sim g^2T$.

this is a better approximation to the true equipment cost. Our main result is a

uniform traffic extend readily to the more practically important case of
quasi-uniform traffic. Finally, we show that if the number of nodes on the ring

ring grooming is fixed-parameter tractable is still an open question.

exploiting a new numerical technique for solving the self-consistent
Bloch-Horowitz equation. Some of the properties of proper effective theories
are thus illustrated and contrasted with the shell model. In the second half of
the talk we use these examples to return to a problem that frustrated the field
three decades ago, the possibility of reducing the effective interactions
problem to perturbation theory. We show, by exploiting the Talmi integral
expansion, that hard-core potentials can be systematically softened by the
introduction of a series of contact operators familiar from effective field
theory. The coefficients of these operators can be run analytically by a
renormalization group method in a scheme-independent way, with the introduction
of suitable counterterms. Once these coefficients are run to the shell model
scale, we show that the renormalized coefficients contain all of the
information needed to evaluate perturbative insertions of the remaining soft
potential. The resulting perturbative expansion is shown to converge in lowest
order for the simplest nucleus, the deuteron.

mainly collected into the event pixel. If the X-ray landing position is
sufficiently close to the pixel boundary, the primary charge spills over to the
adjacent pixel forming split events. We can easily understand that there are
three parameters coupled together; the X-ray landing position inside the pixel,
the X-ray event pattern and the primary charge cloud shape. We can determine
any one of them from the other two parameters. Since we know the charge cloud
shape using the multi-pitch mesh experiment, we can calculate the X-ray landing
position with subpixel resolution using the event pattern. We applied our
method to Ti-K X-rays for the charge-coupled device with $12 \mu$m square
pixel. Once the primary charge splits into the adjacent pixel, we can determine
the X-ray landing position with subpixel resolution. Using three- or four-pixel
split events, we can determine the X-ray landing position with an accuracy of
less than $1 \mu$m. For a two-pixel split event, we obtained a similar position
accuracy in the split direction with no improvement in the direction
perpendicular to it. We will discuss the type of CCD which can achieve the
subpixel resolution for the entire area of the CCD.

as a proof that quantum energy discreteness of an atom plays a crucial role in
the derivation of this law. In our paper we avoid this standpoint. It may be
shown that the de Broglie wave assigned to every material particle is a result
of interaction of the particle with zero-point vibrations of electromagnetic
ground field. The energetic spectrum of a harmonic oscillator is obtained from
this fact within classical physics which coincides with the quantum result.
Thus, it is explained here how the energy discreteness came into existence in
stochastic electrodynamics (SED) --- the classical electrodynamics with
classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation. Next we reconsider the Einstein
work from the viewpoint of SED and derive the Planck formula.
