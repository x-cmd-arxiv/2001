absorption lines and a few emission lines from the H-like and He-like ions of
O, Ne, Mg, Si, and S as well as from Fe XVII - Fe XXIII L-shell transitions. We
have reanalyzed the Chandra HETGS spectrum using better flux and wavelength
calibrations along with more robust methods. Combining several lines from each

determine they are blueshifted relative to the systemic velocity by -610+/-130
km/s. We find the Ne absorption lines in the High Energy Grating spectrum to be
resolved with FWHM=840{+490}{-360} km/s. We have used regions in the spectrum
where no lines are expected to determine the X-ray continuum, and we model the
absorption and emission lines using photoionized-plasma calculations. The model
consists of two absorption components which have an order of magnitude
difference in their ionization parameters. The two components are spherically
outflowing from the AGN and thus contribute to both the absorption and the
emission via P Cygni profiles. The model also clearly requires O VII and O VIII
absorption edges. The low-ionization component of our model can plausibly
produce UV absorption lines with equivalent widths consistent with those
observed from NGC 3783. However, we note that this result is highly sensitive
to the unobservable UV-to-X-ray continuum, and the available UV and X-ray
observations cannot firmly establish the relationship between the UV and X-ray
absorbers. We find good agreement between the Chandra spectrum and simultaneous
ASCA and RXTE observations. We set an upper limit on the FWHM of the narrow Fe
K\alpha emission line of 3250 km/s. This is consistent with this line
originating outside the broad line region, possibly from a torus.

satellite disruption in external galaxies using semi-analytic approximations
for the dependence of streamer length, width and surface brightness on
satellite and primary galaxy characteristics. The semi-analytic method is
tested successfully against N-body simulations and then applied to three
representative astronomical applications. First, we show how streamer
properties can be used to estimate mass-to-light ratios $\Upsilon$ and streamer
ages of totally disrupted satellites, and apply the method to the stellar arc
in NGC 5907. Second, we discuss how the lack of observed tidal debris around a

derive the implied limits on mass-loss rates for M32 and NGC 205 around

hierarchical galaxy formation, and use the predicted debris from a standard
$\Lambda$CDM realization to test the feasibility of such a study. Using the
Local Group satellites and the few known examples of debris trails in the

sharply decreasing oxygen, iron and silicon abundances within $\sim 5$ kpc of

Ia supernovae are expected to produce pronounced central abundance maxima for
all three elements. However, it has been suggested that many of the strong
X-ray lines are optically thick and diffuse to larger radii in the cooling flow
before escaping, falsifying the central abundances. We verify with radiation
transfer calculations that this effect does indeed occur in the M87 cooling
flow, but that it is insufficient to account for the M87 observations. We
suggest that some source of continuous opacity is required to reduce the
central X-ray line emission, perhaps by warm gas at $T \sim 10^5 - 10^6$ K. The
radial surface brightness profiles of X-ray resonance lines are also sensitive
to turbulence in cooling flows which reduces the line center optical depths
considerably. Turbulence may provide sufficient energy to continuously heat the

consistent with the ASCA and BeppoSAX logN-logS functions. Six BeppoSAX sources
have reliable ISOCAM 15 micron counterparts within ~60 arcsec. All these ISOCAM

previously optically classified giving 4 QSOs and 1 BALQSO at z=2.2. The
remaining unclassified source has X-ray and photometric properties consistent
with that of a nearby Seyfert galaxy. One further HX source has a 2.6sigma
ISOCAM counterpart associated with a galaxy at z=0.325. If this ISOCAM source
is real, the HX/MIR properties suggest either an unusual QSO or a cD cluster
galaxy. We have constructed MIR and HX spectral energy distributions to compute
the expected HX/MIR ratios for these classes of objects up to z=3.2 and assess
the HX/MIR survey depth.
  The BALQSO has an observed X-ray softness ratio and HX/MIR flux ratio similar
to QSOs but different to those found for low redshift BALQSOs. This difference
can be explained in terms of absorption, and suggests that high redshift
BALQSOs should be comparatively easy to detect in the HX band, allowing their
true fraction in the high redshift QSO population to be determined (ABRIDGED).

the accretion rate increases with increasing NS velocity. MAGACs will be
produced among high velocity (~> 100 km s-1) high magnetic field (B> 1e14 G)
radio pulsars - the ``magnetars'' - after they have evolved first through
magnetic dipole spin-down, followed by a ``propeller'' phase (when the object
sheds angular momentum on a timescale ~< 1e10 yr). The properties of MAGACS may
be summarized thus: dipole magnetic fields of B~>1e14 G; minimum velocities
relative to the ISM of >25-100 km s-1, depending on B, well below the median in

the data which will be obtained by the forthcoming large
submillimeter/millimeter facilities, mainly by the Atacama Submillimeter
Telescope Experiment (ASTE) and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array/Large
Millimeter and Submillimeter Array (ALMA/LMSA). We first calculate the source
counts from 350 um to 3 mm using the empirical infrared galaxy number count
model of Takeuchi et al. (2001). Based on the number counts, we evaluate the
source confusion and determine the confusion limit at various wavebands as a
function of the characteristic beam size. At submillimeter wavelengths, source
confusion with the 10-15-m class facilities becomes severe at 0.1 to 1 mJy
level, and astrometry and flux measurements will be difficult. However, we show
that very a large-area survey of submillimeter sources brighter than 10-50 mJy
can provide a unique constraint on infrared galaxy evolution at z = 1-2. We
also find that the 5\sigma-confusion limit of the LMSA is fainter than 1 \mu
Jy. The source counts at such faint flux levels give important information of
the epoch of galaxy formation. We then show that multiband photometry from the
infrared (by ASTRO-F) to the millimeter can be utilized as a redshift
estimator. In addition, we compare the observed 1.4, 5, and 8-GHz source counts
with our model counts to examine the contribution of star forming galaxies to
the faint radio galaxies.

the position accuracy for X-ray events which deposit charge in more than one

uncertainty for corner events is much better than the pixel size, we can
improve the Chandra ACIS spatial resolution by selecting only these events.
  We have analyzed X-ray images obtained with the Chandra ACIS for six
point-like sources observed near the optical axis. The image quality near the
optical axis is characterized by a half power diameter (HPD) of $0.^{\!\!\prime
\prime}66$ that is a convolution of the PSF of the HRMA and the CCD pixel shape
($24\,\mu$m square). By considering only corner events the image quality is
improved to $0.^{\!\!\prime \prime}56$ (HPD), which is very close to the image
quality of the HRMA alone. We estimated the degradation of the image quality
obtained by using all events, compared to that obtained using only corner
events, to be $0.^{\!\!\prime \prime}33$, which coincides with that expected
from the pixel size. Since the fraction of the corner events is relatively
small, this technique requires correspondingly longer exposure time to achieve
good statistics.

noncommutative deformation parameter. The picture that unfolds is the
following: when the gauge invariant combination \omega = B + F is constant one
obtains the standard Moyal deformation of the brane world-volume. Similarly,
when d\omega = 0 one obtains the noncommutative Kontsevich deformation,
physically corresponding to a curved brane in a flat background. When the

solution of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton equations from a stationary,
axisymmetric solution of the vacuum Einstein equations. Starting from the Kerr
solution, Davidson and Gedalin have previously made use of this technique to
obtain a pair of oppositely charged, extremal dilatonic black holes, known as a
black dihole. In this paper, we shall instead start from the Kerr-NUT solution.
It will be shown that the new solution can also be interpreted as a dihole, but
with the black holes carrying unbalanced magnetic charges. The effect of the
NUT-parameter is to introduce a net magnetic charge into the system. Finally,
we uplift our solution to ten dimensions to describe a system consisting of D6
and anti-D6-branes with unbalanced charges. The limit in which they coincide
agrees with a solution recently derived by Brax et al..

Nash inequality, Liggett inequality and so on. These inequalities are treated
in a unified way by using Cheeger's method which comes from Riemannian

completed by the author joint with F. Y. Wang. Furthermore, a diagram of the
inequalities and the traditional three types of ergodicity is presented (\S 3).

gratings is suggested for the Hamiltonian path problem on a simple graph G of N
vertices. The photon is input to an N-slit grating followed by an N x N matrix
of `processing units'. A unit consists of a delay line followed by a grating
with k slits (0 < k < N) whose outputs are directed to k units in the next row
in a manner determined by the adjacency matrix of G. There is a one-to-one
mapping between paths of length N-1 in the graph and physical paths through the
matrix. The photon's path is a superposition of all these physical paths. The
time taken by the photon along a physical path corresponding to a Hamiltonian
path in G is a fixed value equal to the sum of N distinct delays, and is
different from the time along any other path. The graph is Hamiltonian if any
one of N detectors placed in the output of the N units in row N detects the
photon at this fixed time.

allows one to identify all the two-qubit correlations which can exhibit
Hardy-type nonlocality.

"quant-ph/0101144","Masato Koashi","Masato Koashi and Nobuyuki Imoto","What is Possible Without Disturbing Partially Known Quantum States?","24 pages, no fogure",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Consider a situation in which a quantum system is secretly prepared in a
state chosen from the known set of states. We present a principle that gives a
definite distinction between the operations that preserve the states of the
system and those that disturb the states. The principle is derived by
alternately applying a fundamental property of classical signals and a
fundamental property of quantum ones. The principle can be cast into a simple
form by using a decomposition of the relevant Hilbert space, which is uniquely
determined by the set of possible states. The decomposition implies the
classification of the degrees of freedom of the system into three parts
depending on how they store the information on the initially chosen state: one
storing it classically, one storing it nonclassically, and the other one
storing no information. Then the principle states that the nonclassical part is
inaccessible and the classical part is read-only if we are to preserve the
state of the system. From this principle, many types of no-cloning,
no-broadcasting, and no-imprinting conditions can easily be derived in general
forms including mixed states. It also gives a unified view on how various
schemes of quantum cryptography work. The principle helps to derive optimum
amount of resources (bits, qubits, and ebits) required in data compression or
in quantum teleportation of mixed-state ensembles.

  ""L'institut Henri Poincare"", Paris, March 2000",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Einstein's reply to Weyl about the importance in General Relativity of the
identity of the sources of spectral lines is well know. We show that, already
in Special Relavitity, Einstein's definition of the unit of time from the
frequency of atomic emission is deeply incompatible with Poincare's classical
conception of time in his special relativity based on the duality ""true
time-local time"". By using Weisskopf's analysis of quantum nature of the
identity of atoms, we show that the concept of identity is implicit in
Einstein's principle of relativity. On the contrary, in Poincare's relativistic
logic, the use of the Lorentz transformations compensates the differences
(contraction of lengths and dilation of durations) that are real by principle.
The borderline ""quantum-classical"" passes therefore clearly between the two
conceptions of the clocks in special relativity.
