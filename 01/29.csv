Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe with a cosmological constant. We obtain the
equations for the evolution of the perturbations in the fully relativistic

solutions to these equations in appropriate limits. We also study the Newtonian

the perturbations will grow slower in the relativistic regime for a two-fluid

a wide range of metal abundances between 1/100 and 10 Z/Zsun.
  The calculation of this grid completes the Vink et al. (2000) mass-loss
recipe with an additional parameter Z. We have found that the exponent of the
power law dependence of mass loss vs. metallicity is constant in the range
between 1/30 and 3 Z/Zsun. The mass-loss rate scales as Mdot \propto Z^0.85
Vinf^p with p = -1.23 for stars with Teff \ga 25000 K, and p = -1.60 for the B
supergiants with Teff \la 25000 K. Taking also into account the metallicity
dependence of Vinf, using the power law dependence Vinf \propto Z^0.13 from
Leitherer et al. (1992), the overall result of mass loss as a function of
metallicity can be represented by Mdot \propto Z^0.69 for stars with Teff \ga
25000 K, and Mdot \propto Z^0.64 for B supergiants with Teff \la 25000 K.
  Our mass-loss predictions are successful in explaining the observed mass-loss
rates for Galactic and Small Magellanic Cloud O-type stars, as well as in
predicting the observed Galactic bi-stability jump. Hence, we believe that our
predictions are reliable and suggest that our mass-loss recipe be used in
future evolutionary calculations of massive stars at different metal abundance.

generalized implicit hypersurfaces, electromagnetism as expressed in terms of
exterior differential systems, and thermodynamics. Starting with a generalized
implicit surface whose normal field is represented by an exterior differential
1-form, it is possible to deduce the curvature invariants of the implicit
surface and to construct a globally closed vector density in terms of the
Jacobian properties of the normal field. When the closed vector density is
assigned the role of an intrinsic charge current density, and the components of
the normal field are assigned the roles of the electromagnetic potentials, the
theory is formally equivalent to an exterior differential system that generates
the PDE's of both the Maxwell Faraday equations and the Maxwell Ampere
equations. The interaction energy density between the potentials and the
induced closed charge current density is exactly the similarity curvature
invariant of highest degree (N-1) for the implicit surface. Although developed
without direct contact with M-brane theory, these ideas of generalized implicit
surfaces should have application to the study of p-branes that can have
multiple components and envelopes. The theory suggests that gravitational
collapse of mass energy density should include terms that involve the
interaction between charge-current densities and electromagnetic potentials.

comes from the fundamental ``trans-Planckian'' physics of quantum liquids. In
the effective theory of the low energy degrees of freedom the vacuum energy
density is proportional to the fourth power of the corresponding ``Planck''
energy appropriate for this effective theory. However, from the exact ``Theory
of Everything'' of the quantum liquid it follows that its vacuum energy density
is exactly zero without fine tuning, if: there are no external forces acting on
the liquid; there are no quasiparticles which serve as matter; no space-time
curvature; and no boundaries which give rise to the Casimir effect. Each of
these four factors perturbs the vacuum state and induces the nonzero value of
the vacuum energy density of order of energy density of the perturbation. This
is the reason, why one must expect that in each epoch the vacuum energy density
is of order of matter density of the Universe, or/and of its curvature, or/and
of the energy density of smooth component -- the quintessence.
