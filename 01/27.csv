density of cold dark matter halo particles at the Galactic center. We compute
this effect in realistic growth models of the present (2-3)*10**6 solar mass BH
from a low-mass seed BH, with special attention to dynamical modeling in a
realistic galaxy environment with merger and orbital decay of a seed BH formed
generally outside the exact center of the halo. An intriguing ``very-dense
spike'' of dark matter has been claimed in models of Gondolo and Silk with
density high enough to contradict with experimental upper bounds of neutralino
annihilation radiation. This ``spike'' disappears completely or is greatly
weakened when we include important dynamical processes neglected in their
idealized/restrictive picture with cold particles surrounding an at-the-center
zero-seed adiabaticly-growing BH. For the seed BH to spiral in and settle to
the center within a Hubble time by dynamical friction, the seed mass must be at
least a significant fraction of the present BH. Any subsequent at-the-center
growth of the BH and steepening of the central Keplerian potential well can
squeeze the halo density distribution only mildly, whether the squeezing
happens adiabatically or instantaneously.

of 107 sources indicates that 65% +/- 8% of the cluster membership possesses
(inner) disks. This fraction is lower than those (86% +/- 8% and 80% +/- 7%)
obtained from similar JHKL surveys of the younger NGC 2024 and Trapezium

age. Sources with circumstellar disks in IC 348 have a median age of 0.9 Myr,
while the diskless sources have a median age of 1.4 Myr, for a cluster distance
of 320 pc. Although the difference in the median ages between the two
populations is only marginally significant, our results suggest that over a
timescale of 2 - 3 Myr, more than a third of the disks in the IC 348 cluster
disappear. Moreover, we find that at a very high confidence level, the disk
fraction is a function of spectral type. All stars earlier than G appear
diskless, while stars with spectral types G and later have a disk fraction
ranging between 50% - 67%, with the latest type stars having the higher disk
fraction. This suggests that the disks around stars with spectral types G and
earlier have evolved more rapidly than those with later spectral types. The
L-band disk fraction for sources with similar ages in both IC 348 and Taurus is
the same, within the errors, suggesting that, at least in clusters with no O

progenitor giant star is overtaken by a subsequent fast wind generated as the
star enters its white dwarf stage$^{1}$. A shock forms near the boundary
between the winds, which creates a relatively dense shell that provides the
characteristic appearance of a planetary nebula. A spherically symmetric wind
will produce a spherically symmetric shell, yet over half of known planetary
nebulae are not spherical; rather, they are elliptical or bipolar in
shape$^{2}$. While a magnetic field could launch and collimate a bipolar
outflow, the origin of such a field has hitherto been unclear, as previous work
suggested that a field could not be generated${^3}$. Here we show that an
asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) star can indeed generate a strong magnetic field,
in a dynamo at the interface between a rapidly rotating core and the more
slowly rotating envelope of the star. The field is strong enough to shape the
bipolar outflows that produce the observed bipolar planetary nebulae. Magnetic
braking of the stellar core during this process may also explain the
puzzlingly$^{4}$ slow rotation of most white dwarf stars.

  In the x=0.1 sample, the observation of two spin wave branches typical of two
distinct types of magnetic coupling, and of a modulation in the elastic diffuse
scattering characteristic of ferromagnetic inhomogeneities, confirms the static
and dynamic inhomogeneous features previously observed at x$<$0.1. The
anisotropic q-dependence of the intensity of the low-energy spin wave suggests
a bidimensionnal character for the static inhomogeneities. At x=0.125, which
corresponds to the occurence of a ferromagnetic and insulating state, the two
spin wave branches reduce to a single one, but anisotropic. At this
concentration, an anomaly appears at {\bf q$_0$}=(1.25,1.25,0), that could be
related to an underlying periodicity, as arising from (1.5,1.5,0)

observed at q$_0$, extra magnetic excitations are observed at larger q, forming

  Oscillators or Discrete Breathers","to be published in Physica B",,"10.1016/S0921-4526(00)00804-8",,"cond-mat",,"  It is well known that any amount of energy injected in a harmonic oscillator
which is resonant and weakly coupled with a second harmonic oscillator, tunnels
back and forth between these two oscillators. When the two oscillators are
anharmonic, the amplitude dependence of their frequencies breaks, in general,
any initial resonance so that no substantial energy transfer occurs unless an
almost perfect resonance persists. This paper considers this interesting
situation more generally between two discrete breathers (DBs) belonging to two
weakly coupled nonlinear systems, finite or infinite. A specific amount of
energy injected as a DB in a nonlinear system (donor) which is weakly coupled
to another nonlinear system (acceptor) sustaining another DB, might be totally
transferred and oscillate back and forth between these donor and acceptor DBs.
The condition is that a certain well defined detuning function is bounded from
above and below by two coupling functions. This targeted energy transfer (TET)
is selective, i.e., it only occurs for an initial energy close to a specific
value. The calculation of these functions in complex models with numerical
techniques developed earlier for DBs, allows one to detect the existence of
possible TET, between which DBs and at which energy. It should also help for
designing models having desired TET properties. We also show how extra linear
resonances could make TET incomplete and irreversible. Developments of the
theory will be able to describe more spectacular effects, such as TET cascades
and avalanches, and energy funnels. Besides rather short term applications for
devices, this theory might provide an essential clue for understanding puzzling
problems of energy kinetics in real materials, chemistry and bioenergetics.

However, under certain conditions related to the equation of state and the
compactness of the stellar model, the eigenfrequency lies inside the continuous

solutions have to be discarded as being unphysical. We corroborate our results
by explicitly integrating the time dependent equations. For stellar models
admitting a physical $r$-mode solution, it can indeed be excited by arbitrary

evolutions do not show any tendency to oscillate with the respective frequency.

Initially we consider the models in the limit as c -> 1 and find that the
relevant boundary fields all have simple interpretations in this limit. This
interpretation allows us to conjecture the IR limits of flows in the unitary
minimal models generated by the fields \phi_{rr} of `low' weight. We check this
conjecture using the truncated conformal space approach. In the process we find
evidence for a new series of integrable boundary flows.

approximation of $\Phi$ by bounded analytic matrix functions. The approach
essentially relies on the notion of a monotone thematic factorization
introduced in [AP]. In the last section we discuss hereditary properties of
unitary interpolants. In particular, for matrix functions $\Phi$ of class

factorization of a very badly approximable matrix function $\Phi$. Such
factorizations are defined in terms of so-called balanced unitary-valued
functions which have many remarkable properties. Unlike the case of thematic
factorizations studied earlier in [PY1], [PY2], [PT], [AP1], the factors in
canonical factorizations (as well as partial canonical factorizations) are
uniquely determined by the matrix function $\Phi$ up to constant unitary
factors. We study many properties of canonical factorizations. In particular we
show that under certain natural assumptions on a function space $X$ the
condition $\Phi\in X$ implies that all factors in a canonical factorization of
$\Phi$ belong to the same space $X$. In the last section we characterize the
very badly approximable unitary-valued functions $U$ that satisfy the condition

the process of fragmentation of finite, highly excited, Lennard-Jones systems.
We analyze the behavior of the caloric curves (CC), the associated thermal
response functions (TRF) and cluster mass distributions for constrained and
unconstrained hot drops. It is shown that the resulting CC's for the
constrained case differ from the one in the unconstrained case, mainly in the
presence of a ``vapor branch''. This branch is absent in the free expanding
case even at high energies . This effect is traced to the role played by the
collective expansion motion. On the other hand, we found that the recently
proposed characteristic features of a first order phase transition taking place
in a finite isolated system, i.e. abnormally large kinetic energy fluctuations
and a negative branch in the TRF, are present for the constrained (dilute) as
well the unconstrained case. The microscopic origin of this behavior is also
analyzed.
