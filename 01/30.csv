functions, the aperture mass statistic and the top-hat smoothed variance of the

present results on angular scales from 3 arc-seconds to half a degree. The
consistency of different statistical measures is demonstrated and confirms the

the gravitational potential. For Cold Dark Matter models we find $\sigma_8
\Omega_0^{0.6}=0.43^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$ at the 95% confidence level. The
measurement over almost three decades of scale allows to discuss the effect of
the shape of the power spectrum on the cosmological parameter estimation. The
degeneracy on sigma_8-Omega_0 can be broken if priors on the shape of the
linear power spectrum (that can be parameterized by Gamma) are assumed. For
instance, with Gamma=0.21 and at the 95% confidence level, we obtain
0.6<sigma_8<1.1 and 0.2<Omega_0<0.5 for open models, and sigma_8>0.65 and
Omega_0<0.4 for flat (Lambda-CDM) models. From the tangential/radial modes
decomposition we can set an upper limit on the intrinsic shape alignment, which
was recently suggested as a possible contribution to the lensing signal. Within

occurred before most of the gas entered the dark halos. Alternatively, the hot
gas in groups may be heated internally by Type II supernovae when the galactic
stars formed. We investigate here the gas-dynamical consequences of various
amounts of external, high redshift heating and compare with internal supernova
heating. Radiative losses and distributed mass dropout are included. We find
that externally heated flows are unsatisfactory; when the heating is high
enough to bring the X-ray luminosities into agreement with observations, the
gas entropy is too high. Flows internally heated by Type II supernovae are
preferred. Our results are insensitive to the epoch and spatial distribution of
the supernova heating process. However, with a Salpeter IMF a large fraction of
the energy produced by supernovae must heat the hot gas. Alternatively, only
about 20 percent of the Type II supernova energy would be required to heat the

test for an evolutionary connection, the chemical compositions of cool EHes are
compared with those of hot EHes and R CrBs. Relative to Fe, the N abundance of
these stars is intermediate between those of hot EHes and R CrBs. For the R
CrBs, the metallicity M derived from the mean of Si and S appears to be more
consistent with the kinematics than that derived from Fe. When metallicity M
derived from Si and S replaces Fe, the observed N abundances of EHes and R CrBs
fall at or below the upper limit corresponding to thorough conversion of
initial C and O to N. There is an apparent difference between the composition
of R CrBs and EHes; the former having systematically higher [N/M] ratios. The
material present in the atmospheres of many R CrBs is heavily CN- and
ON-cycled. Most of the EHes have only CN-cycled material in their atmospheres.
There is an indication that the CN- and ON-cycled N in EHes was partially
converted to Ne by $\alpha$-captures. If EHes are to evolve to R CrBs, fresh C
in EHes has to be converted to N. If Ne is found to be normal in R CrBs, the
proposal that EHes evolve to R CrBs fails. The idea that R CrBs evolve to EHes
is ruled out; the N abundance in R CrBs has to be reduced to the level of EHes,
as the C/He which is observed to be uniform across EHes, has to be maintained.
Hence, the inferred [N/M], C/He, [Ne/M], and the H-abundances of these two
groups indicate that the EHes and the R CrBs may not be on the same
evolutionary path.

between the asymmetry we observed and the mechanism that produces a subluminous

A statistical study was developed to find fundamental relationships between the

Abundance ratios indicate that there seems to be no preferential stellar mass
for the WR phenomenon to occur in the nucleus of a planetary nebula. The PNe M

trend of the electron density decreasing with decreasing spectral type, which

with decreasing spectral type, that one might expect in such a scenario. Two
objects with very late [WC] central stars, K 2-16 and PM 1-188, do not follow

from the AGB. The 6 WELS of our sample follow the same density vs. [WC]-type
relation as the bona fide WRPNe, but they tend to have smaller expansion

  on the Definition of the Stellar Core Boundary during Spiral-in","4 pages, 1 figure, A&A in press",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20010099",,"astro-ph",,"  According to the standard picture for binary interactions, the outcome of
binaries surviving the evolution through a common envelope (CE) and spiral-in
phase is determined by the internal structure of the donor star at the onset of
the mass transfer, as well as the poorly-known efficiency parameter, eta_CE},
for the ejection of the H-envelope of the donor. In this Research Note we
discuss the bifurcation point which separates the ejected, unprocessed H-rich
material from the inner core region of the donor (the central part of the star
which will later contract to form a compact object). We demonstrate that the
exact location of this point is very important for evaluating the binding
energy parameter, lambda, which is used to determine the post-CE orbital
separation. Here we compare various methods to define the bifurcation point
(core/envelope boundary) of evolved stars with masses 4, 7, 10 and 20 M_sun. We
consider the specific nuclear energy production rate profile, the change in the
mass-density gradient (Bisscheroux 1998), the inner region containing less than
10% hydrogen, the method suggested by Han et al. (1994) and the entropy
profile. We also calculated effective polytropic index profiles. The entropy
profile method measures the convective boundary (at the onset of flatness in
the specific entropy) which is not equivalent to the core boundary for RGB
stars. Hence, this method is not applicable for RGB stars, unless the actual
bifurcation point of a CE is located at the bottom of the outer convection zone
(resulting in larger values of lambda and larger post-CE orbital separations).
On the AGB, where highly degenerate and condensed cores are formed, we find
good agreement between the various methods, except for massive (20 M_sun)
stars.

thermally-induced motion of a small portion of (a ``point'' on) each suspension
fiber, thereby recording the random forces driving the test-mass motion close
to each violin-mode frequency. One can then suppress the thermal noise by
optimally subtracting the recorded fiber motions from the measured motion of
the test mass, i.e., from the LIGO output. The proposed method is a
modification of an analogous but more technically difficult scheme by
Braginsky, Levin and Vyatchanin for reducing broad-band suspension thermal
noise. The efficiency of our method is limited by the sensitivity of the sensor
used to monitor the fiber motion. If the sensor has no intrinsic noise (i.e.
has unlimited sensitivity), then our method allows, in principle, a complete
removal of violin spikes from the thermal-noise spectrum. We find that in
LIGO-II interferometers, in order to suppress violin spikes below the
shot-noise level, the intrinsic noise of the sensor must be less than
\~2*10^{-13}cm/sqrt(Hz). This sensitivity is two orders of magnitude greater
than that of currently available sensors.

perturbation in the transverse-traceless gauge, and calculate its amplitude and
angular dependence. We find that in the ultra-relativistic limit the

typical burst's frequency is Doppler shifted, with the blue-shift factor being
strongly beamed in the forward direction. As a consequence, the energy flux
carried by the gravitational radiation is beamed. In the second part of the
paper we estimate the anticipated detection rate of such bursts by a
gravitational-wave detector, for blobs ejected in supernova explosions. Dar and
De Rujula recently proposed that ultra-relativistic blobs ejected from the

Substituting the most likely values of the parameters as suggested by their

the new method of construction of the matrix element of the electroweak current
operator. The electroweak current matrix element satisfies the relativistic
covariance conditions and in the case of the electromagnetic current also the
conservation law automatically. The properties of the system as well as the
approximations are formulated in terms of form factors. The approach makes it
possible to formulate relativistic impulse approximation in such a way that the
Lorentz-covariance of the current is ensured. In the electromagnetic case the
current conservation law is ensured, too. The results of the calculations are
unambiguous: they do not depend on the choice of the coordinate frame and on
the choice of ""good"" components of the current as it takes place in the

a Standard-Model-like scenario is realized. In this scenario no new particle
will be discovered, except a single Higgs boson having partial widths or
coupling constants with fundamental particles, whose squares are close, within
anticipated experimental uncertainty, to those of the SM. Experiments at a
Photon Collider can resolve whether the SM or e.g. the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model
is realized in Nature.
  For the SM-like realizations of the 2HDM (II) we study the loop couplings of
the Higgs boson with \gamma\gamma and Z \gamma, and also with gluons. The
deviation of the two-photon width from its SM value is generally higher than
the expected inaccuracy in the measurement of \Gamma_{\gamma \gamma} at a
Photon Collider. The deviation is sensitive to the parameters of the Higgs self
interaction.

  Being massive by the Anderson-Higgs mechanism, gluon and photon should mix
together within two linear combinations due to the color non-conservation.
Consequently a gluon $\widetilde{G}$ could decay into an $e^- e^+$ pair via its
photon component. With a low invariant mass (about a few ten MeV) and an
extremely narrow width peaking above the continuum background, the purely
leptonic decay of a strongly-interacting gluon $\widetilde{G} \to e^- + e^+$
constitutes a very distinctive signature of the color superconductivity phase.
By a similar scenario of gluon-$Z$ mixing, another ""missing-energy"" decay into
invisible neutrinos $\widetilde{G} \to \nu +\bar{\nu}$ could arise, its
amplitude is however $(\Delta/M_Z)^2$ power-suppressed.

then we find that the geometry in its vicinity is warped in such a way that
gravity on the brane can become very weak, independently of the volume of the
extra dimensions. As a consequence, self-gravity can make the brane structure
enter into the determination of the hierarchy between the Planck scale and a
lower fundamental scale. In an extreme case, one can obtain a novel
reformulation of the hierarchy problem in brane worlds, without the need for
large-size extra dimensions; the hierarchy would be generated when the ratio
between the scales of brane tension and brane thickness is large. In a sense,
such a scenario is half-way between the one of Arkani-Hamed et al.(ADD)

detail the propagation of fields in the background of this geometry, and find

discuss the presence of black branes and black holes in this setting, and the

the most simple topology is that generated by the existence of a single 1-form

intersections. In such a topology the exterior derivative becomes a limit point
generator in the sense of Kuratowski. The utilization of such techniques in
physical systems is examined. A key feature of the Cartan topology is
determined by the Pfaff dimension (representing the minimum number of functions
to describe the 1-form generator). In particular, when the Pfaff dimension is 3
or more the Cartan topology becomes a disconnected topology, with the existence
of topological torsion and topological parity. Most classical physical
applications are constrained to cases where the Pfaff dimension is 2 or less,
for such is the domain of unique integrability. The more interesting domain of
non-unique solutions requires the existence of topological torsion, and can
lead to an understanding of irreversible processes without the use of

the informal description given by the physicists, it is a probability measure
on the space of connections modulo gauge transformations on a principal bundle
with compact structure group. We are interested in the case where the base
space of this bundle is a compact orientable surface.
  The construction of the measure in a discrete setting, where the base space
of the fiber bundle is replaced by a graph traced on a surface, is quite well
understood thanks to the work of E. Witten. In contrast, the continuum limit of
this construction, which should allow to put a genuine manifold as base space,
still remains problematic.
  This work presents a complete and unified approach of the discrete theory and
of its continuum limit. We give a geometrically consistent definition of the
Yang-Mills measure, under the form of a random holonomy along a wide, intrinsic
and natural class of loops. This definition allows us to study combinatorial
properties of the measure, like its Markovian behaviour under the surgery of
surfaces, as well as properties specific to the continuous setting, for
example, some of its microscopic properties. In particular, we clarify the
links between the Yang-Mills measure and the white noise and show that there is
a major difference between the Abelian and semi-simple theories. We prove that
it is possible to construct a white noise using the measure as a starting point
and vice versa in the Abelian case but we show a result of asymptotic
independence in the semi-simple case which suggests that it is impossible to
extract a white noise from the measure.

  Now special Lagrangian cones in C^3 are linked to the theory of harmonic maps
and integrable systems. Harmonic maps from a Riemann surface into complex
projective space CP^n are an integrable system, and can be studied and
classified using loop group techniques. If N is a special Lagrangian cone in

conformal harmonic.

\psi : R^2 --> CP^2. We work through the integrable systems theory for these
examples, showing that they are superconformal of finite type, and calculating
their harmonic sequences, Toda and Tzitzeica solutions, algebra of polynomial
Killing fields and spectral curves. We also study the double periodicity
conditions for \psi, and so find families of superconformal tori in CP^2.
  We finish by asking whether our more general construction of special
Lagrangian 3-folds can also be derived from a higher-dimensional integrable
system, and whether the special Lagrangian equations themselves are in some
sense integrable.

based on the existence of a linear Stark shift for alkali atoms in their ground
state perturbed by a quadrupolar interaction potential and a magnetic field.
This shift is proportional to the T-even pseudoscalar built from the
quadrupolar potential symmetry axis, the directions of the applied electric and
magnetic fields.It involves on the one hand the anisotropy of the hyperfine
interaction induced by the quadrupolar interaction and, on the other,the static
electric dipole moment arising from electroweak interactions inside the
nucleus. The case of ground state cesium atoms trapped in a uniaxial (hcp)
phase of solid helium-4 is examined. From an explicit evaluation of both the
hyperfine structure anisotropy and the static P-odd T-even dipole deduced from
recent empirical data about the cesium nuclear anapole moment, we predict the
Stark shift. It is three times the experimental upper bound to be set on the

occurs when the driving frequency of a parametrically excited nonlinear
oscillator slowly varies with time. In this regime, the resonant excitation is
continuous and unarrested by the oscillator nonlinearity. The system has three
characteristic time scales, the fastest one corresponding to the natural
frequency of the oscillator. We perform averaging over the fastest time scale
and analyze the reduced set of equations analytically and numerically.
Analytical results are obtained by exploiting the scale separation between the
two remaining time scales which enables one to use the adiabatic invariant of
the perturbed nonlinear motion.

topological, rather than geometrical, concepts. Chirality is to be associated
with enantiomorphic pairs which induce Optical Activity, while Helicity is to
be associated enantiomorphic pairs which induce a Faraday effect.
Experimentally, the existence of enantiomorphic pairs is associated with the
lack of a center of symmetry, which is also serves as a necessary condition for
Optical Activity. However, Faraday effects may or may not require a lack of a
center of symmetry. The two species of enantiomorphic pairs are distinct, as
the rotation of the plane of polarization by Optical Activity is a reciprocal
phenomenon, while rotation of the plane of polarization by the Faraday effect
is a non-reciprocal phenomenon. From a topological viewpoint, Maxwell's
electrodynamics indicates that the concept of Chirality is to be associated
with a third rank tensor density of Topological Spin induced by the interaction
of the 4 vector potentials {A,phi} and the field excitations {D,H}. The
distinct concept of Helicity is to be associated with the third rank tensor
field of Topological Torsion induced by the interaction of the 4 vector
potentials and field intensities {E,B}.

harmonic oscillators with fundamental (Wick-rotated imaginary) frequencies
$\omega_p = i log~p$ (p is a prime) and whose harmonics are $\omega_{p, n} = i

suggests a natural classification of quantum systems into those containing
