vicinity, concentrating on the 8.6' X 8.7' area covered by the Caltech Faint
Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (the `Caltech area'). The minimum detectable
fluxes in the 0.5-2 keV and 2-8 keV bands are 1.3e-16 cgs and 6.5e-16 cgs,
respectively and a total of 82 sources are detected. More than 80% of the
extragalactic X-ray background in the 2-8 keV band is resolved. Redshifts are
available for 96% of the sources with R<23; the redshift range is 0.1-3.5 with
most sources having z < 1.5. Eight of the X-ray sources are located in the
HDF-N itself, including two not previously reported. A population of X-ray
faint, optically bright, nearby galaxies emerges at soft-band fluxes of ~<
3e-16 cgs.
  We set the tightest constraints to date on the X-ray emission properties of
microJy radio sources, mid-infrared sources detected by ISO, and very red
(R-K_s > 5.0) objects. Where both the infrared and the X-ray coverage are
deepest, 75% of the X-ray sources are detected by ISO; the high X-ray to
infrared matching rate bodes well for future sensitive infrared observations of
faint X-ray sources. Four of the 33 very red objects that have been identified
in the Caltech area by Hogg et al. (2000) are detected in X-rays; these four
are among our hardest Chandra sources, and we argue that they contain
moderately luminous obscured AGN. Overall, however, the small Chandra detection
fraction suggests a relatively small AGN content in the optically selected very
red object population. (Abridged)

companions at rates ranging up to near Eddington. Accretion at high rates onto
neutron stars goes through cycles with time-scales of days to months. At lower
average rates the sources are recurrent transients; after months to years of
quiescence, during a few weeks some part of a disk dumps onto the neutron star.
Quasiperiodic oscillations near 1 kHz in the persistent X-ray flux attest to
circular motion close to the surface of the neutron star. The neutron stars are
probably inside their innermost stable circular orbits and the x-ray
oscillations reflect the structure of that region. The long term variations
show us the phenomena for a range of accretion rates. For black hole compact
objects in the binary, the disk flow tends to be in the transient regime.
Again, at high rates of flow from the disk to the black hole there are
quasiperiodic oscillations in the frequency range expected for the innermost
part of an accretion disk. There are differences between the neutron star and
black hole systems, such as two oscillation frequencies versus one. For both
types of compact object there are strong oscillations below 100 Hz.
Interpretations differ on the role of the nature of the compact object.

magnetosphere of a spinning neutron star. The charge depletion due to global
flows of charged particles, causes a large electric field along the magnetic
field lines. Migratory electrons and/or positrons are accelerated by this field
to radiate curvature gamma-rays, some of which collide with the X-rays to
materialize as pairs in the gap. The replenished charges partially screen the
electric field, which is self-consistently solved together with the
distribution functions of particles and gamma-rays. If no current is injected
at neither of the boundaries of the accelerator, the gap is located around the
conventional null surface, where the local Goldreich-Julian charge density
vanishes. However, we first find that the gap position shifts outwards (or
inwards) when particles are injected at the inner (or outer) boundary. Applying
the theory to the Crab pulsar, we demonstrate that the pulsed TeV flux does not
exceed the observational upper limit for moderate infrared photon density and
that the gap should be located near to or outside of the conventional null
surface so that the observed spectrum of pulsed GeV fluxes may be emitted via a
curvature process. Some implications of the existence of a solution for a super
Goldreich-Julian current are discussed.

happens because the scattering theory underlying Lifshitz formula is not well
formulated when the dielectric permittivity takes account of dissipation. To
give the zeroth term of Lifshitz formula the definite meaning different
prescriptions were used recently by different authors with diversed results.
These results are shown to be improper and in disagreement with experiment and
the general physical requirements. We propose the new prescription which is a
generalization of Schwinger, DeRaad and Milton recipe formulated earlier for
ideal metals. On this base the detailed numerical and analytical computations
of the temperature Casimir force are performed in configuration of two plane
plates and a spherical lens (sphere) above a plate. The corrections due to
nonzero temperature and finite conductivity found in the paper are in agreement
with the limiting case of perfect metal and fit all experimental and

without artificial modification of the Schroedinger equation. The latter is
rigorously derived instead as universal expression of unreduced interaction
complexity. Causal, totally realistic wavefunction is obtained as a dynamically
probabilistic intermediate state of a simple system with interaction performing
dynamically discrete transitions between its localised, incompatible
""realisations"" (""corpuscular"" states). Causal wavefunction and Schroedinger
equation are then extended to arbitrary level of world dynamics. We outline
some applications of the obtained causal description, such as genuine quantum
chaos (quant-ph/9511034-36) and realistic quantum devices (physics/0211071),
and emphasize the basic difference of the proposed dynamically multivalued
theory from dynamically single-valued imitations of causality and complexity.
The causally complete wavefunction concept, representing the unified essence of
unreduced (multivalued) complex dynamics, provides a clear distinctive feature
of realistic science, absent in any its unitary imitation.
