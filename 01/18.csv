no systematic streaming motions are seen in the area of the nuclear
grand-design spiral or the circumnuclear ring, the amplitude of residual
velocities, after subtracting a model circular velocity field, reaches 20 km/s
in projection. The rotation curve levels out at around 140 km/s, after a
well-resolved and rather shallow rise. We have generated an analytical model
for the nuclear spiral and fitted it to our observations to obtain estimates of
the pattern speed of the spiral and the sound speed in the central region of
NGC 5248. Our results are consistent with a low pattern speed, suggesting that
the nuclear spiral rotates with the same rate as the main spiral structure in
NGC 5248, and thus that the spiral structure is coupled from scales of a few
hundred parsecs to several kiloparsecs. We have also compared the observed
structure and kinematics between the nuclear regions of NGC 5248 and M100.
Several similarities and differences are discussed, including the location of
the peak emission regions on major and minor axes, and the spiral arm streaming
motions. We find no kinematic evidence for a presence of a nuclear bar in NGC

be to establish the redshift distribution of the recently-discovered sub-mm

information which has been gleaned to date for the ~ 50 bright sub-mm sources
which have been uncovered via the six main classes of survey performed with
SCUBA on the JCMT over the last 2-3 years. Despite the biases inherent in some
of these surveys, and the crudeness of the redshift information available in
others, I conclude that all current information suggests that only 10-15 % of
luminous sub-mm sources lie at z < 2, and that the median redshift of this
population is z ~ 3. I suggest that such a high median redshift is arguably not
unexpected given current theories designed to explain the correlation between
black-hole mass and spheroid mass found at low redshift. In such scenarios,
peak AGN emission is expected to correspond to, or even to cause termination of
major star-formation activity in the host spheroid. In contrast, maximum dust
emission is expected to occur roughly half-way through the star-formation
process. Given that optical emission from bright quasars peaks at z = 2.5,
dust-emission from massive ellipticals might be reasonably expected to peak at
some point in the preceding ~ 1 Gyr, at z ~ 3. Confirmation or refutation of
this picture requires significantly-improved redshift information on bright
samples of SCUBA sources.

seeing conditions, the intrinsic brightness of the star observed and the

measurements for most of the stars have become available. As a result some of

variability (by a factor of 2) on a longer time scale was observed between the
two observations. Indeed, in November 1997, the lowest flux ever recorded was
detected by BeppoSAX. The broad band spectra obtained with the BeppoSAX narrow
field instruments show marginal evidence of a reflection component. This
structure could explain the very flat spectra previously observed in the 2-10

intensity appears to remain almost constant between the two observations even

understand the problem of the origin of the line, data from previous

favored is one where the line is produced at a distance of approximatively 8
light years from the continuum source region, rather than having its origin in
the accretion disk. In the framework of the standard unified models for AGN,
this suggests that its origin is located in the molecular torus.

shall hereafter call M31*) has many features in common with Sgr A* at the
Galactic Center, yet they differ in several significant and important ways.
Though M31* is probably ten times heavier, its radio luminosity at 3.6 cm is
only one third that of Sgr A*. At the same time, M31* is apparently thousands
of times more luminous in X-rays than its Galactic Center counterpart. Thus, a
comparative study of these objects can be valuable in helping us to understand
the underlying physical basis for their activity. We show here that the
accretion model being developed for Sgr A* comprises two branches of solutions,
distinguished by the relative importance of cooling compared to compressional
heating at the radius $r_C$ where the ambient gas is captured by the black
hole. For typical conditions in the ISM, the initial temperature ($T[r_C]\sim
10^6-10^7$ K) sits on the unstable branch of the cooling function.
  Depending on the actual value of $T(r_C)$ and the accretion rate, the plasma
settles either onto a hot branch (attaining a temperature as high as $10^{10}
K$ or so at small radii) or a cold branch, in which $T$ drops to $\sim 10^4$ K.
Sgr A* is presumably a `hot' black hole. We show here that the VLA, UV and {\it
Chandra} observations of M31* reveal it to be a member of the `cold' black hole
family. We discuss several predicted features in the spectrum of M31* that may
be testable by future multi-wavelength observations, including the presence of
a prominent UV spike (from hydrogen line emission) that would be absent on the
hot branch.

phase space and not single time-dependent trajectories. Therefore, ensemble
averages are the natural objects of statistical probabilities. This is the
physical origin of coarse-graining which is not anymore a mathematical ad hoc

phase space by its corresponding box-counting volume. This is equal to the
volume of the closure $\bar{\cal{M}}$. With this extension the Second Law is
derived without invoking the thermodynamic limit. The irreversibility in this
approach is due to the replacement of the phase-space volume by the volume of
its closure $\bar{\cal{M}}$. The physical reason for this replacement is that
macroscopic measurements cannot distinguish ${\cal{M}}$ from $\bar{\cal{M}}$.
Whereas the former is not changing in time due to Liouville's theorem, the
volume of the closure can be larger. In contrast to conventional coarse
graining the box-counting volume is defined in the limit of infinite
resolution. I.e. there is no artificial loss of information.

designed single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) chains are studied theoretically. At high
salt conditions, ssDNA forms compacted hairpin patterns stabilized by
base-pairing and base-pair stacking interactions, and a threshold external
force is needed to pull the hairpinned structure into a random coiled one. The
base-pair stacking interaction in the ssDNA chain makes this hairpin-coil
conversion a discontinuous (first-order) phase transition process characterized
by a force plateau in the force-extension curve, while lowering this potential
below some critical level turns this transition into continuous (second-order)
type, no matter how strong the base-pairing interaction is. The phase diagram
(including hairpin-I, -II, and random coil) is discussed as a function of
stacking potential and external force. These results are in quantitative
agreement with recent experimental observations of different ssDNA sequences,
and they reveal the necessity to consider the base-pair stacking interactions

Our results indicate that the remnant of this instability is a persistent

Furthermore, dynamical instability is shown to occur in $n$=3.33 polytropes

of two possible types of cuts in various baryonium exchanges. As the baryonium
with the highest intercept easily couples to two Pomerons such transfers should
occur abundantly in percolating dense Pomerons systems. From the color
structure this quark-less baryonium can be identified with an Odderon exchange.
As the Odderon is predicted to have an almost Pomeron -like trajectory it has
to involve small coupling constants so that steeper trajectories can initially
determine the data. As this suppression is not anticipated for diffractive
processes a tiny observable backward peak should occur in the initial baryon
distribution for massive diffractive systems.

and (anti) protons are extracted from experimental data of e^+e^- annihilation
at the Z-boson resonance and at centre-of-mass energy root(s) = 29 GeV. This
fit also yields a new NLO value for the strong-coupling constant, namely
alpha_s^(5)(M_Z) = 0.1170 +- 0.0073. The scaling violations encoded in the FFs
through the Altarelli-Parisi evolution equations are tested by confronting
(e^+e^-)-annihilation data from DESY DORIS, DESY PETRA, and CERN LEP2 with NLO
predictions based on these FFs. Comparisons of p p-bar data from CERN S p p-bar
S and the Fermilab Tevatron, gamma p data from DESY HERA, and gamma gamma data

starting from microscopic initial conditions, while the long-wavelength
fluctuations do scale with the linear size of the system, signalling dynamical
infrared properties quite different from the equilibrium ones. I also introduce
a non-gaussian Hartree-Fock approximation (tdHF) and I derive the mean-field
coupled time-dependent Schroedinger equations for the modes of the scalar
field. The dynamical evolution of a uniform condensate is studied in a further
controlled gaussian approximation, for N=1. Results similar to the large N case
show an internal inconsistency of this approximation. I also study the dynamics

first of all verify that the large coupling limit of the O(N+1) phi^4 model,

stretched strings from the visible brane to a hidden D6-brane in the extra

mediation while in the closed string channel supersymmetry is broken by gravity
mediation. Hence, we call this kind of mediation ``string mediation''. We
propose an extension of the Dimopoulos-Georgi theorem to brane models: only
detached probe branes can break supersymmetry without generating a tachyon.
Fermion masses are generated at one loop if the branes break a sufficient
amount of the ten dimensional Lorentz group while scalar potentials are
generated if there is a force between the visible brane and the hidden brane.
Scalars can be lifted at two loops through a combination of brane bending and

attractive features; in particular they are very general and do not depend on
the details of the quantization method. However we point out that, of the two

others), while the second contains certain technical flaws. We correct these
errors and, within the new, improved scheme, calculate the entropy of
3-dimensional black holes. We find that, while the new symmetry vector fields
are well-defined on the ``stretched horizon,'' and lead to well-defined
Hamiltonians satisfying the expected Lie algebra, they fail to admit a
well-defined limit to the horizon. This suggests that, although the formal
calculation can be carried out at the classical level, its real, conceptual
origin probably lies in the quantum theory.

supersymmetric discrete light-cone quantization (SDLCQ), which preserves the
supersymmetry at every order of the approximation and treats fermions and
bosons on the same footing. This calculation is done at large $N_c$. For small
and intermediate r the correlator converges rapidly for all couplings. At small
r the correlator behaves like 1/r^6, as expected from conformal field theory.
At large r the correlator is dominated by the BPS states of the theory. There
is, however, a critical value of the coupling where the large-r correlator goes
to zero, suggesting that the large-r correlator can only be trusted to some
finite coupling which depends on the transverse resolution. We find that this
critical coupling grows linearly with the square root of the transverse
momentum resolution.

one and in the analytic category have a monogenic dependence on the parameter,

standard linearized conjugacy equation for germs of holomorphic maps in a
neighborhood of a fixed point. The parameter is the eigenvalue $q$ of the
linear part. This problem has been first investigated by Arnol'd and Herman.
Herman raised the question whether the solutions of the cohomological equation
had a quasianalytic dependence on the parameter. Indeed they are analytic
outside $\S^1$ which is a natural boundary but the solutions are still defined
at points of $\S^1$ which lie ``far enough from resonances''. We adapt to our
case Herman's construction of an increasing sequence of compacts which avoid
resonances and prove that the solutions belong to the associated space of
monogenic functions. The solutions admit asymptotic expansions at the points of
$\S^1$ which satisfy some arithmetical condition, and Carleman's Theorem allows
us to answer negatively to the question of quasianalyticity at these points.
But resonances (roots of unity) lead to asymptotic expansions, for which
quasianalyticity is obtained as a particular case of \'Ecalle's theory of
resurgent functions. At constant-type points one can still recover the
solutions from their asymptotic expansions and obtain a special kind of
quasianalyticity. Our results are obtained by reducing the problem to the study
of a fundamental solution (which is the ``quantum logarithm''). We deduce as a
corollary of our work the proof of a conjecture of Gammel on the monogenic and
quasianalytic properties of a certain number-theoretical Borel-Wolff-Denjoy
series.

  editorial",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  The mass equivalency [m*c^2 = h*f] applies to gravitational mass just as to
inertial mass. From that, the gravitational mass has a corresponding,
associated, equivalent frequency, f. Using that frequency a new result is
obtained in which the significance of the Planck Length is clarified. The
Planck Length is fundamental to gravitation and in effect supercedes G in that
role because it is found that there is operational or mechanical significance
to the role of the Planck Length in gravitation whereas G is simply a constant
of proportionality. It further is shown that the Planck Length [and, likely the
Planck mass and the Planck time] are slightly mis-defined by the use of h-bar
[h/2pi] rather than simply Planck's constant, h. Theoretical implications of
these results are presented. In addition, the applicability of using the
frequency aspect of mass in the analysis of gravitation, and the nature of the
results obtained, would appear to imply a considerably greater significance for
the frequency, that is the WAVE, aspect of mass, matter, and particles in
general than has been heretofore recognized.

interpretation of experimental data for explicit determination of all the
correlations. They are arithmetic identities independent of statistical
reasoning and thus cannot be violated by data that meets the conditions for
their validity. Two experimentally performable procedures are described to meet
these conditions. Once such data are acquired, it follows that the measured
correlations cannot all equal a negative cosine of angular differences. The
relation between this finding and the predictions of quantum mechanics is
discussed in a companion paper.
