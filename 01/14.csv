clouds in hierarchical cosmogonies have suggested that the very first stars
(the so-called Population III) may have been rather massive. Here we point out
that a numerous population of massive black holes (MBHs) -- with masses
intermediate between those of stellar and supermassive holes -- may be the
endproduct of such an episode of pregalactic star formation. If only one MBH
with m > 150 msun formed in each of the `minihalos' collapsing at z=20 from
3-sigma fluctuations, then the mass density of Pop III MBHs would be comparable
to that of the supermassive variety observed in the nuclei of galaxies. Since
they form in high-sigma rare density peaks, relic MBHs are predicted to cluster
in the bulges of present-day galaxies as they become incorporated through a
series of mergers into larger and larger systems. Dynamical friction would
cause more than 50 (m/150 msun)^{1/2} such objects to sink towards the center.
The presence of a small cluster of MBHs in galaxy nuclei may have several
interesting consequences associated with tidal captures of ordinary stars
(likely followed by disruption), MBH capture by the central supermassive black
hole, gravitational wave radiation from such coalescences. Accreting
pregalactic MBHs may be detectable as ultra-luminous, off-nuclear X-ray
sources.

results. I point out that the modified dynamics (MOND) predicts for disc
galaxies a distribution of fictitious dark matter that comprises two
components: a pure disc and a rounder halo. The former dominates the true disc
in regions of small accelerations, where it controls the z-dynamics in the disc
(disc flaring etc.); it has a finite total mass. It also dominates the round
component near the centre where the geometry is nearly planar. The second
component controls motions far from the plane, has a total enclosed mass that
diverges linearly with radius, and determines the rotation curve at large
radii. Its ellipticity may be appreciable at small radii but vanishes
asymptotically. This prediction of MOND differs from what one expects from
galaxy-formation scenarios with dark matter.
  Analyses to date, which, as they do, assume one component--usually with a
constant ellipticity, perforce give conflicting results for the best-value
ellipticity, depending on whether they probe the disc or the sphere, small
radii or large ones.

lensed HI clouds (akin to damped Lyman-$\alpha$ clouds) at high redshift by
carrying out deep radio observations in the fields of known cluster lenses.
Such observations will be possible with present radio telescopes only if the
lens substantially magnifies the flux of the HI emission. While at present this
holds the only possibility of detecting the HI emission from such clouds, it
has the disadvantage of being restricted to clouds that lie very close to the
caustics of the lens. We find that observations at a detection threshold of 50
micro Jy at 320 MHz (possible with the GMRT) have a greater than 20%
probability of detecting an HI cloud in the field of a cluster, provided the
clouds have HI masses in the range 5 X 10^8 M_{\odot} < M_{HI} < 2.5 X 10^{10}
M_{\odot}. The probability of detecting a cloud increases if they have larger
HI masses, except in the cases where the number of HI clouds in the cluster
field becomes very small. The probability of a detection at 610 MHz and 233 MHz
is comparable to that at 320 MHz, though a definitive statement is difficult
owing to uncertainties in the HI content at the redshifts corresponding to
these frequencies. Observations at a detection threshold of 2 micro Jy
(possible in the future with the SKA) are expected to detect a few HI clouds in
the field of every cluster provided the clouds have HI masses in the range 2 X
10^7 M_{\odot} < M_{HI} < 10^9 M_{\odot}. Even if such observations do not
result in the detection of HI clouds, they will be able to put useful
constraints on the HI content of the clouds.

to compute a maximum agreement subtree of the two trees. Previous work on this

two special kinds, namely, uniformly labeled trees (i.e., trees with all their
nodes labeled by the same symbol) and evolutionary trees (i.e., leaf-labeled

algorithm for comparing trees that are labeled in an arbitrary manner. In
addition to this generality, this algorithm is faster than the previous
algorithms.
  Another contribution of this paper is on maximum weight bipartite matchings.
We show how to speed up the best known matching algorithms when the input
graphs are node-unbalanced or weight-unbalanced. Based on these enhancements,
we obtain an efficient algorithm for a new matching problem called the
hierarchical bipartite matching problem, which is at the core of our maximum

fixed points and not on the flow connecting them. Typically, its value is
related to the central charges a and c. In classically-conformal field
theories, scale invariance is broken by quantum effects and the flow invariant
a_{UV}-a_{IR} is measured by the area of the graph of the beta function between
the fixed points. There exists a theoretical explanation of this fact. On the
other hand, when scale invariance is broken at the classical level, it is
empirically known that the flow invariant equals c_{UV}-c_{IR} in massive
free-field theories, but a theoretical argument explaining why it is so is
still missing. A number of related open questions are answered here. A general
formula of the flow invariant is found, which holds also when the stress tensor
has improvement terms. The conditions under which the flow invariant equals
