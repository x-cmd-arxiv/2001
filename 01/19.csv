trapped in an outer mean motion resonance with a Jupiter mass protoplanet. The
gaps opened in the disk by the two planets overlap, therefore the two planet
system exchanges angular momentum with the disk at the inner planet's Inner
Lindblad Resonances (ILRs) and at the outer planet Outer Lindblad Resonances
(OLRs). Since the torques are proportional to the square of the planet masses,
and since the inner planet is about three times more massive than the outer
one, the ILR torques are favored by a factor ~10 with respect to the one planet
case. In the case presented here, this leads to a positive differential
Lindblad torque and consequently an outwards migration. We briefly discuss the
long-term behavior of the system, which could account for the high
eccentricities of the extra-solar planets with semi-major axis a>0.2 AU.

absorption systems to derive the hydrogen ionization fractions and the
distribution of the face-on total gas column density. We consider axially
symmetric, randomly oriented absorbers, ionized by an external background
radiation field in order to relate the face-on total gas distribution to that
of the neutral hydrogen observed along the line of sight. We devise a
statistical procedure based on the Maximum Likelihood criterion, that is able
to treat simultaneously data coming from different surveys and statistically
recovers the ""true"" column densities in the presence of large uncertainties:
this is especially important for Lyman-limit systems which leave an
unmeasurable residual flux at wavelengths shorter than the Lyman break. We make
use of simulated data to look for possible observational biases and extensively
test our procedure. For a large statistical sample of real data in the redshift
range [1.75,3.25] (collected from all published surveys) our Maximum Likelihood
procedure gives a power-law slope for the total hydrogen distribution of -2.7.
All together Lyman-limit systems therefore contain more gas than Damped
Lyman-alpha systems. Analysis of data at other redshifts shows that more
observations are needed to reach a compelling evidence for a cosmological
evolution of the slope of the gas distribution.

smaller than those from earlier studies, but is consistent within measurement
errors, and is also consistent with theoretical estimates of the radii of
irradiated Jupiter-like planets. Satellites or rings orbiting the planet would,
if large enough, be apparent from distortions of the light curve or from
irregularities in the transit timings. We find no evidence for either
satellites or rings, with upper limits on satellite radius and mass of 1.2

obscured (Sanders 2000). This raises the intriguing possibility that a
physically meaningful classification system for high-redshift galaxies might be
more easily devised at rest-frame infrared wavelengths, rather than in the
optical regime. Practical realization of this idea will become possible with
the advent of the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST). In order to explore
the capability of NGST for undertaking such science, we present NASA-IRTF and
SCUBA observations of NGC 922, a chaotic system in our local Universe which
bears a striking resemblance to objects such as HDF 2-86 (z=0.749) in the HDF
North. If objects such as NGC 922 are common at high-redshifts, then this
galaxy may serve as a local morphological `Rosetta stone' bridging low and
high-redshift populations. In this paper we demonstrate that quantitative
measures of galactic structure are recoverable in the rest-frame infrared for
NGC 922 seen at high redshifts using NGST, by simulating the appearance of this
galaxy at redshifts z=0.7 and z=1.2 in rest-frame K'. Our results suggest that
the capability of efficiently exploring the rest-wavelength IR morphology of
high-z galaxies should probably be a key factor in deciding the final choice of

SN1991Tbu (Schmidt et al. 1994), this can be explained by the emergence of a
light echo from a foreground dust cloud. Based on a simple model we argue that
the amount of dust required can consistently explain the extinction which has
been estimated by completely independent methods. Because of the similar echo
luminosity but much higher optical depth of the dust in SN1998bu compared with

strong correlation exists. The lack of correlation suggests a formation of all
metal-poor GC in similar gas fragments. A weak correlation might exist between
mean [Fe/H] of the metal-poor GC and host galaxy metallicity. This would imply
that some fragments in which metal-poor GC formed were already embedded in the
larger dark matter halo of the final galaxy (as oppose to being independent
satellites that were accreted later). Our result suggests a homogeneous
formation of metal-poor GC in all galaxies, in typical fragments of masses
around 10^9-10^10 solar masses with very similar metallicities, compatible with
hierarchical formation scenarios for galaxies. We compared the mean [Fe/H] of

observations reveal all the radio emission (at 5 GHz) to come from a compact
core with physical dimensions smaller than 65*d(kpc) AU. The combined radio
data reveal a persistent and inverted radio spectrum, with spectral index
\~+0.5. The source is also detected at 350 GHz, on an extrapolation of the
radio spectrum. Flat or inverted radio spectra are now known to be typical of
the Low/Hard X-ray state, and are believed to arise in synchrotron emission
from a partially self-absorbed jet. Comparison of the radio and sub-millimetre

emission from the jet extends to the near-infrared, or possibly even optical
regimes. In this case the ratio of jet power to total X-ray luminosity is
likely to be P_J/L_X >> 0.01, depending on the radiative efficiency and

We have examined the features of a steady and subsonic wind solutions which
extend the model of Weber and Davis (1967), which is a representative solar
wind model. As a result, we found that the entropy per baryon becomes lower and
the dynamical timescale becomes longer as the angular velocity becomes higher.
These results are inappropriate for the production of the r-process nuclei. As
for the effects of magnetic fields, we found that a solution as a steady wind
from the surface of the proto-neutron star can not be obtained when the
strength of the magnetic field becomes $\ge$ $10^{11}$ G. Since the magnetic
field in normal pulsars is of order $10^{12}$ G, a steady wind solution might
not be realized there, which means that the models in this study may not be
adopted for normal proto-neutron stars. In this situation, we have little
choice but to conclude that it is difficult to realize a successful r-process

extend down to the temperatures where the superparamagnetic blocking takes
place (A/kT \sim 25), provided only the interaction strength is weak enough.
Besides, taking exactly the anisotropy into account, the results describe as
particular cases the effects of the interactions on isotropic (A = 0) as well
as strongly anisotropic (A \to \infty) systems (discrete orientation model and

a transverse force proportional to normal fluid velocity u and normal fluid
density. We have linearized the time-independent two-fluid equations about the
exact solution for a vortex, and find three solutions which are important in
the region far from the vortex. Uniform superfluid flow gives rise to the usual
superfluid Magnus force. Uniform normal fluid flow gives rise to no forces in
the linear region, but does not satisfy reasonable boundary conditions at short
distances. A logarithmically increasing normal fluid flow gives a viscous
force. As in classical hydrodynamics, and as in the early work of Hall and
Vinen, this logarithmic increase must be cut off by nonlinear effects at large
distances; this gives a viscous force proportional to u/ln(u), and a transverse
contribution which goes like u/(ln u)^2, even in the absence of an explicit
Iordanskii force. In the limit u goes to zero the TAN result is obtained, but
at nonzero u there are important corrections that were not found in TAN. We
argue that the Magnus force in a superfluid at nonzero temperature is an
example of a topological relation for which finite-size corrections may be
large.

controlled by molecular diffusion of dispersed phase between droplets/bubbles.
Studies of dilute emulsions have shown how the osmotic pressure of a trapped
species within droplets can ``osmotically stabilise'' the emulsion. Webster and
Cates (Langmuir, 1998, 14, 2068-2079) gave rigorous criteria for osmotic
stabilisation of mono- and polydisperse emulsions, in the dilute regime. We
consider here whether analogous criteria exist for the osmotic stabilisation of
mono- and polydisperse concentrated emulsions and foams, and suggest that the
pressure differences driving coarsening are small compared to the mean Laplace
pressure. An exact calculation confirms this for a monodisperse 2D model,
finding a bubble's pressure as P_i = P + Pi + P_i^G, with P, Pi the atmospheric
and osmotic pressures, and P_i^G a ``geometric pressure'' that reduces to the
Laplace pressure only for a spherical bubble. For Princen's 2D emulsion model,
P_i^G is only 5% larger in the dry limit than the dilute limit. We conclude
that osmotic stabilisation of dense systems typically requires a pressure of
trapped molecules in each droplet that is comparable to the Laplace pressures
the same droplets would have if spherical, as opposed to the much larger
Laplace pressures present in the system. We study coarsening of foams and
concentrated emulsions when there is insufficient of the trapped species
present. Rate-limiting mechanisms are considered, their applicability and
associated droplet growth rates discussed. In a concentrated foam or emulsion,
a finite yield threshold for droplet rearrangement may be enough to prevent
coarsening of the remainder.

non-commutative scheme type of theory for the curved finitary spacetime sheaves
of the non-abelian incidence Rota algebras that represent `gravitational
quantum causal sets'. The finitary spacetime primitive algebra scheme
structures for quantum causal sets proposed here are interpreted as the
kinematics of a curved and reticular local quantum causality. Dynamics for
quantum causal sets is then represented by appropriate scheme morphisms, thus
it has a purely categorical description that is manifestly `gauge-independent'.
Hence, a schematic version of the Principle of General Covariance of General
Relativity is formulated for the dynamically variable quantum causal sets. We
compare our non-commutative scheme-theoretic curved quantum causal topology
with some recent $C^{*}$-quantale models for non-abelian generalizations of
classical commutative topological spaces or locales, as well as with some
relevant recent results obtained from applying sheaf and topos-theoretic ideas
to quantum logic proper. Motivated by the latter, we organize our finitary
spacetime primitive algebra schemes of curved quantum causal sets into a
topos-like structure, coined `quantum topos', and argue that it is a sound
model of a structure that Selesnick has anticipated to underlie Finkelstein's
reticular and curved quantum causal net. At the end we conjecture that the
fundamental quantum time-asymmetry that Penrose has expected to be the main
characteristic of the elusive `true quantum gravity' is possibly of a
kinematical or structural rather than of a dynamical character, and we also
discuss the possibility of a unified description of quantum logic and quantum
gravity in quantum topos-theoretic terms.

will be found (Standard-Model-like scenario). This can occur in the Standard
Model (SM) as well as in other models, including the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model
(2HDM), the MSSM, etc. Experiments at a Photon Collider can resolve these
cases.
  In this paper we compare the SM and the 2HDM~(II). In the analysis we use as
independent quantities the ratios, to the SM values, of couplings of the
observed Higgs boson to gauge bosons, and to up and down-type quarks (basic
couplings). We derive a relation between these ratios within the 2HDM~(II), a
pattern relation. With the aid of this relation, different possible
realizations of an SM-like scenario are found. For these realizations, we
calculate the loop couplings of the Higgs boson with \gamma\gamma and Z \gamma,
and also with gluons, taking into account the expected accuracy in the
measurements of the basic couplings. The obtained deviation of the two-photon
width from its SM value is generally higher than the expected inaccuracy in the
measurement of \Gamma_{\gamma \gamma} at a Photon Collider. The result is
sensitive to the parameters of the Higgs self interaction.

The
introductory part of the review is intended to be accessible to the general
reader. M-theory is an eleven-dimensional quantum theory of gravity which is
believed to underlie all superstring theories. This is the only candidate at
present for a theory of fundamental physics which reconciles gravity and
quantum field theory in a potentially realistic fashion. Evidence for the
existence of M-theory is still only circumstantial---no complete
background-independent formulation of the theory yet exists. Matrix theory was
first developed as a regularized theory of a supersymmetric quantum membrane.
More recently, the theory appeared in a different guise as the discrete
light-cone quantization of M-theory in flat space. These two approaches to
matrix theory are described in detail and compared. It is shown that matrix
theory is a well-defined quantum theory which reduces to a supersymmetric
theory of gravity at low energies. Although the fundamental degrees of freedom
of matrix theory are essentially pointlike, it is shown that higher-dimensional
fluctuating objects (branes) arise through the nonabelian structure of the
matrix degrees of freedom. The problem of formulating matrix theory in a
general space-time background is discussed, and the connections between matrix
theory and other related models are reviewed.

potentials such as V=x^2+y^2+igxy^2 and V=x^2+y^2+z^2+igxyz, where g is a real
parameter, are investigated. These theories appear to possess real, positive
spectra. Low-lying energy levels are calculated to very high order in
perturbation theory. The large-order behavior of the perturbation coefficients
is determined using multidimensional WKB tunneling techniques. This approach is
also applied to the complex Henon-Heiles potential V=x^2+y^2+ig(xy^2-x^3/3).
