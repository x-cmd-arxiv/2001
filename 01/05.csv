space mission that gave us an unparallel view of the Universe in the infrared,
and provided us with hundreds of observations of star forming regions and
bipolar outflows. Three of the instrument teams, in charge of the infrared
camera (CAM) and the two spectrometers at short and long wavelengths (SWS and
LWS respectively), used a significant fraction of their guarantee time to study
YSOs and outflows spectroscopically. In here, I will briefly review some of
their main findings, particularly the detection of water, H2 rotational
emission lines and the presence of other complex molecules. I will present new
spectroscopic results on HH 1-2, HH 7-11 and Cep E, and their sources. And

planets ($\sim M_{J}$) of nearby stars have been discovered. Their existence
has been inferred from tiny Doppler shifts in the light from the star and in
one case a transit has been observed. Because ordinary planets are not expected
to be able to form this close to ordinary stars due to the high temperatures,
it has been speculated that the close-in large planets are in fact exotic
heavenly bodies made of mirror matter. We show that the accretion of ordinary
matter onto the mirror planet (from e.g.the solar wind from the host star)
should make the mirror planet opaque to ordinary radiation with an effective
radius ($R_p$) large enough to explain the measured size of the transiting
close-in extrasolar planet, HD209458b. Furthermore we obtain the rough
prediction that $R_{p} \propto \sqrt{{T_s\over M_p}}$ (where $T_s$, is the
surface temperature of the ordinary matter in the mirror planet and $M_p$ is
the mass of the mirror planet) which will be tested in the near future as more
transiting planets are found. We also show that the mirror world interpretation
of the close-in extra solar planets explains the low albedo of $\tau$ Boo b
because the large estimated mass of $\tau$ Boo b ($\sim 7M_J$) implies a small
effective radius of $R_p \approx 0.5R_J$ for $\tau$ Boo.

Fe. The O VII edge and 1s^2--1snp resonance line series to n=9 are clearly
detected at rest in the AGN frame. We attribute previous reports of an
apparently highly redshifted O VII edge to the 1s^2--1snp (n > 5) O VII
resonance lines, and a neutral Fe L absorption complex. The shape of the Fe L
feature is nearly identical to that seen in the spectra of several X-ray
binaries, and in laboratory data. The implied dust column density agrees with
that obtained from reddening studies, and gives the first direct X-ray evidence
for dust embedded in a warm absorber. The O VIII resonance lines and weak edge
are also detected, and the spectral rollover below 2 keV is explained by the
superposition of numerous absorption lines and edges. We identify, for the
first time, a KLL resonance in the O VI photoabsorption cross section, giving a
measure of the O VI column density. The O VII (f) emission detected at the
systemic velocity implies a covering fraction of ~5% (depending on the observed
vs. time-averaged ionizing flux). Our observations show that a dusty warm
absorber model is not only adequate to explain all the spectral features > 0.48

Branduardi-Raymont et al. (2001) that this spectral region is dominated by
highly relativistic line emission from the vicinity of the black hole.

of virialized objects which condense out of a low-density cosmological
background universe, either matter-dominated or flat with a cosmological
constant. This generalizes the model we derived previously for an Einstein-de
Sitter (EdS) universe. The model is based upon the assumption that cosmological
haloes form from the collapse and virialization of top-hat density
perturbations and are spherical, isotropic, and isothermal. This leads to the
prediction of a unique, nonsingular, truncated isothermal sphere (TIS), a
particular solution of the Lane-Emden equation (modified for nonzero
cosmological constant). The size and virial temperature are unique functions of
the mass and redshift of formation of the object for a given background
universe. The central density is roughly proportional to the critical density
of the universe at the epoch of collapse. This TIS model is in good agreement
with observations of the internal structure of dark matter--dominated haloes on
scales ranging from dwarf galaxies to X-ray clusters. It also reproduces many
of the average properties of haloes in simulations of the Cold Dark Matter
(CDM) model to good accuracy, suggesting that it is a useful analytical
approximation for haloes which form from realistic initial conditions. Our TIS
model matches the density profiles of haloes in CDM N-body simulations outside
the innermost region, while avoiding the steep central cusp of the latter which
is in apparent conflict with observations. The TIS model may also be relevant
to nonstandard CDM models, like self-interacting dark matter, recently proposed
to resolve this conflict.

the hardness ratio analysis shows that the spectra of the majority of our
sources can be represented with a ``scatterer'' model similar to obscured
Seyfert galaxies locally.
  According to this model, our sources present high intrinsic absorption
(logN_H~23) but also significant amounts of soft X-ray emission coming from
scattered light.

the Local Group and its gravitational acceleration. This relation serves as a
test for the kinematic origin of the CMB dipole and as a method for estimating
beta. We calculate the misalignment angle between the two vectors and compare
it to the observed value for the PSCz survey. The latter value is near the
upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the angle; therefore, the
nonlinear effects are unlikely to be responsible for the whole observed
misalignment. We also study the relation between the amplitudes of the LG
velocity and gravity vectors. In an Omega=1 Universe, the smoothed gravity of
the LG turns out to be a biased low estimator of the LG (unsmoothed) velocity.
In an Omega=0.3 Universe, the estimator is biased high. The discussed biases
are, however, only a few per cent, thus the linear theory works to good
accuracy. The gravity-based estimator of the LG velocity has also a scatter
that limits the precision of the estimate of beta in the LG velocity-gravity
comparisons. The random error of beta due to nonlinear effects amounts to
several per cent.

equations for strictly stationary spacetimes, is defined and analyzed in a
purely spacetime context (without invoking the projection formalism). In this
setting, the Ehlers group finds its natural description within an infinite
dimensional group of transformations that maps Lorentz metrics into Lorentz
metrics and which may be of independent interest. The Ehlers group is shown to
be well defined independently of the causal character of the Killing vector
(which may become null on arbitrary regions). We analyze which global
conditions are required on the spacetime for the existence of the Ehlers group.
The transformation law for the Weyl tensor under Ehlers transformations is
explicitly obtained. This allows us to study where, and under which
circumstances, curvature singularities in the transformed spacetime will arise.
The results of the paper are applied to obtain a local characterization of the
Kerr-NUT metric.

considered muon polarization in K_L to mu+ mu- and K to pi mu+ mu- decays.
Although the effects are small, or difficult to measure because of the small

the CKM parameters. The experimental difficulty appears comparable to the
observation of K to pi nu barnu. New sources of physics, involving non-standard
CP violation, could produce effects observable in these measurements. Limits
from new results on the neutron and electron electric dipole moment, and
epsilon-prime over epsilon in neutral kaon decays, do not eliminate certain

polarization out of the decay plane in KMU3 and radiative KMU2 decays also

manifolds by means of the Fedosov procedure. The main ingredient of this
approach is a bilinear symmetric form defined on the complexified tangent
bundle of the symplectic manifold and subject to some set of algebraic and
differential conditions. It is precisely the structure which describes a
deviation of the Wick-type star-product from the Weyl one in the first order in
the deformation parameter. The geometry of the symplectic manifolds equipped by
such a bilinear form is explored and a certain analogue of the
Newlander-Nirenberg theorem is presented. The 2-form is explicitly identified
which cohomological class coincides with the Fedosov class of the Wick-type
star-product. For the particular case of K\""ahler manifold this class is shown
to be proportional to the Chern class of a complex manifold. We also show that
the symbol construction admits canonical superextension, which can be thought
of as the Wick-type deformation of the exterior algebra of differential forms
on the base (even) manifold. Possible applications of the deformed superalgebra
to the noncommutative field theory and strings are discussed.

two-dimensional projections is hopelessly underdetermined without additional
assumptions. While parameterized inversions are typically used to solve this
problem, we present theoretical results along a different route to the
elimination of indeterminacy. Suppose that we have a series of N radiographs
measuring X-ray or proton attenuation through an evolving object at a sequence
of times. Suppose also that we know the deterministic dynamical laws governing
the evolution of the object we are probing with radiography. The these laws can
be used to combine the radiographs into one ""super""-measurement which can then
be inverted to the object sequence. Now suppose the objects are points in $R^n$
and the radiographs are points in $R^d$. It would be expected that the best we
could do would be to get invertability when N = $\lceil n/d \rceil$. The worst
case is that we never get invertability. We look at both cases carefully for
linear dynamics. We show that dynamical laws giving this optimally short
invertibility time are generic. We then illustrate with numerical examples and
present a conjecture for the nonlinear case.

real variable are described in the present paper; the computational results
that characterize the comparative accuracy of these methods are presented; an
effect of error autocorrection is considered. This effect occurs in efficient
methods of rational approximation (e.g., Pade approximations, linear and
nonlinear Pade-Chebyshev approximations) where very significant errors in the
coefficients do not affect the accuracy of the approximation. The matter of
import is that the errors in the numerator and the denominator of a fractional
rational approximant compensate each other. This effect is related to the fact
that the errors in the coefficients of a rational approximant are not
distributed in an arbitrary way but form the coefficients of a new approximant
to the approximated function. Understanding of the error autocorrection
mechanism allows to decrease this error by varying the approximation procedure
depending on the form of the approximant. Some applications are described in
the paper. In particular, a method of implementation of basic calculations on
decimal computers that uses the technique of rational approximations is
described in the Appendix. To a considerable extent the paper is a survey and
the exposition is as elementary as possible.

Lyapunov exponents and associated characteristic directions of stretching. We
give a description of the second-order response to perturbations in terms of
Lagrangian derivatives of the exponents and characteristic directions. These
derivatives are related to generalised Lyapunov exponents, which describe
deformations of phase-space elements beyond ellipsoidal. When the flow is
chaotic, care must be taken in evaluating the derivatives because of the
exponential discrepancy in scale along the different characteristic directions.
Two matrix decomposition methods are used to isolate the directions of
stretching, the first appropriate in finding the asymptotic behaviour of the
derivatives analytically, the second better suited to numerical evaluation. The
derivatives are shown to satisfy differential constraints that are realised
with exponential accuracy in time. With a suitable reinterpretation, the
results of the paper are shown to apply to the Eulerian framework as well.

  Quantum Optical Test","Modified/alternate version of the quantum optical experiment in
  quant-ph/9904075; 7 pages; 1 figure",,,"IIA/01/2","quant-ph",,"  In order to understand whether nonlocality implies information transfer, a
quantum optical experimental test, well within the scope of current technology,
is proposed. It is essentially a delayed choice experiment as applied to
entangled particles. The basic idea is: given two observers sharing
position-momentum entangled photons, one party chooses whether she measures
position or momentum of her photons after the particles leave the source. The
other party should infer her action by checking for the absence or presence of
characteristic interference patterns after subjecting his particles to certain
optical pre-processing. An occurance of signal transmission is attributed to
the breakdown of complementarity in incomplete measurements. Since the result
implies that the transferred information is classical, we discuss some
propositions for safeguarding causality.

a two-level system introduced earlier are generalized to include arbitrary
energy splittings between the two levels as well as intensity-dependent
interactions. We show that the couple-channel Hamiltonians obtained correspond
to the generalizations of the nonresonant and intensity-dependent nonresonant
Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonians, widely used in quantized theories of laser. In
this general context, we determine the eigenstates, eigenvalues, the time
evolution matrix and the population inversion matrix factor.

of anyonic systems. In mathematical terms, these are unitary topological
modular functors. They underlie the Jones polynomial and arise in
Witten-Chern-Simons theory. The braiding and fusion of anyonic excitations in
quantum Hall electron liquids and 2D-magnets are modeled by modular functors,
opening a new possibility for the realization of quantum computers. The chief
advantage of anyonic computation would be physical error correction: An error
rate scaling like $e^{-\a\l}$, where $\l$ is a length scale, and $\alpha$ is
some positive constant. In contrast, the $\q$presumptive"" qubit-model of
quantum computation, which repairs errors combinatorically, requires a
fantastically low initial error rate (about $10^{-4}$) before computation can
be stabilized.

ferroelectrically coupled Ge/Si quantum dots. The spin of single electrons form
the fundamental qubits. Small (<10 nm diameter) Ge quantum dots are optically
excited to create spin polarized electrons in Si. The static polarization of an
epitaxial ferroelectric thin film confines electrons laterally in the
semiconductor; spin interactions between nearest neighbor electrons are
mediated by the nonlinear process of optical rectification. Single qubit
operations are achieved through ""g-factor engineering"" in the Ge/Si structures;
spin-spin interactions occur through Heisenberg exchange, controlled by
ferroelectric gates. A method for reading out the final state, while required
for quantum computing, is not described; electronic approaches involving single
electron transistors may prove fruitful in satisfying this requirement.
