the abundance is 0.32 \+- 0.05 solar and the absorption consistent with the

enhancement is consistent with the supernova enrichment scenario. The excess
absorption may be attributed to the cooling flow, whose mass flow rate is 80 +-
40 M_Sun/yr from our spectral fit. The BeppoSAX and ASCA radial temperature
profiles agree over the entire overlapping radial range r < 25' = 1.6/h_50 Mpc.
The combined BeppoSAX and ASCA temperature profile exhibits a constant value
out to a radius of 10' (650/h_50 kpc) and a significant decrease (T propto
r^-0.55, corresponding to gamma=1.28) at larger radii. These temperature data
are used to derive the total mass profile. The best fit NFW dark matter density
model results in a temperature profile that is not convectively stable, but the
model is acceptable within the uncertainties of the data. The temperature
profile is acceptably modeled with a ``core'' model for the dark matter
density, consisting of a core radius with a constant slope at larger radii.
With this model the total mass and formal 90% confidence errors within the
virial radius r_178 (2.5/h_50 Mpc) are 9.1+3.6-1.5 x 10^14 h_50^-1 M_Sun, by a
factor of 1.4 smaller than the isothermal value. The gas mass fraction
increases with radius, reaching f_gas(r_178) = 0.26+0.05-0.10 x h_50^-3/2.
Assuming that the measured gas mass fraction is the lower limit to the
primordial baryonic fraction gives Omega_m < 0.4 at 90% confidence.

the central part of the Shapley Concentration, covering an extremely wide range
of densities, from the rich cluster cores to the underlying supercluster
environment. Our sample is homogeneous, in a well defined magnitude range
(17=<b_J=<18.8) and contains ~1300 spectra of galaxies at the same distance,
covering an area of ~26 sq.deg. These characteristics allowed an accurate
spectral classification, that we performed using a Principal Components
Analysis technique.
  This spectral classification, together with the [OII] equivalent widths and
the star formation rates, has been used to study the properties of galaxies at
different densities: cluster, intercluster (i.e. galaxies in the supercluster
but outside clusters) and field environment.
  No significant differences are present between samples at low density regimes
(i.e. intercluster and field galaxies). Cluster galaxies, instead, not only
have values significantly different from the field ones, but also show a
dependence on the local density. Moreover, a well defined morphology-density
relation is present in the cluster complexes, although these structures are
known to be involved in major merging events. Also the mean equivalent width of
[OII] shows a trend with the local environment, decreasing at increasing
densities, even if it is probably induced by the morphology-density relation.
  Finally we analyzed the mean star formation rate as a function of the
density, finding again a decreasing trend (at ~ 3sigma significance level). Our
analysis is consistent with the claim of Balogh et al. (1998) that the star
formation in clusters is depressed.

over 2.7 orbital cycles remarkably similar to optical and UV light curves which
are dominated by the companion star. Count rates are modulated close to the
orbital period, attaining a maximum when the inner face of the companion star,
irradiated by X-rays from the compact source, is most-visible. Cold reflection
provides an acceptable fit to the energy spectrum. Employing binary geometry to
scale the model and assuming companion star reflection, we are able to
reconstruct the incident X-rays which are removed from our direct line-of-sight
(presumably by the accretion disk). We find the flux of the hidden source to be
identical to the observed flux of Her X-1 at the peak of its main-high state.
Consequently, Her X-1 is emitting a reflected spectrum, largely uncontaminated
by direct X-rays in the anomalous low-state. The spectral energy distribution,
period, amplitude and phasing of the modulation are all consistent with a
companion star origin. Since this source occurs in a well-understood binary
environment, it provides an excellent case study for more sensitive experiments
in the future.

good agreement in the column density and b-parameter distributions, down to the

absorber population is complete for N_HI\ga 10^{13} cm^-2, with a column
density distribution slope of \beta=2.04\pm 0.23 and a median b-parameter of 21
km/s above this limit. The intergalactic gas giving rise to these weak
absorbers is analogous to that at high redshift, located in diffuse large-scale
structures that are highly photoionized by the metagalactic UV flux, though a
greater number arise within shock-heated warm gas. The density, temperature,
and column density of these absorbers follow similar relationships to those at
high redshift, though with substantially larger scatter due to the shock-heated
gas. The b-parameters typically have a significant contribution from thermal
broadening, which facilitates a measurement of the low-z IGM temperature as
traced by Ly-alpha absorbers. From our simulation we estimate T_IGM\sim 5000 K,

km/s and the orbital period of the system is 0.17013 +/- 0.00010 d. The implied
value of the mass function, f(M) = 6.00 +/- 0.36 solar masses, provides a hard
lower limit on the mass of the compact primary that greatly exceeds the maximum
allowed mass of a neutron star. Thus we conclude that the compact primary is a
black hole. Among the eleven dynamically established black-hole X-ray novae,
the large mass function of XTE J1118+480 is rivaled only by that of V404 Cyg.
We estimate that the secondary supplies 34% +/- 8% of the total light at 5900A
and that its spectral type is in the range K5V to M1V. A double-humped I-band
light curve is probably due to ellipsoidal modulation, although this
interpretation is not entirely secure because of an unusual 12-minute offset
between the spectroscopic and photometric ephemerides. Assuming that the light
curve is ellipsoidal, we present a provisional analysis which indicates that
the inclination of the system is high and the mass of the black hole is
correspondingly modest. The broad Balmer emission lines (FWHM = 2300-2900 km/s)
also suggest a high inclination. For the range of spectral types given above,

and the first one found to host a warm absorber. The quasar turned out to be an
outstanding object in many respects. It has a high ratio of X-ray/optical
luminosity, is surrounded by the largest quasar emission-line nebula known, and
is located in the outskirts of a cluster of galaxies. Here, we present results
from an analysis of the X-ray spectral, temporal, and spatial properties of
this source and its environment based on deep ROSAT observations.
  Remarkably, we do not detect any excess X-ray cold absorption expected to
originate from the giant gas nebula surrounding MR2251-178. This excludes the
presence of a huge HI envelope around the quasar. The X-ray spectrum of
MR2251-178 is best fit by a warm-absorbed powerlaw with an ionization parameter
log U = 0.5 and a column density log N_w = 22.6 which, however, cannot be the
same material as the giant optical emission line nebula. The mean (0.1--2.4)keV
X-ray luminosity amounts to 10^{45} erg/s.
  A spatial analysis shows that the bulk of the X-ray emission from the quasar
is consistent with a point source, as expected in view of the powerlaw-shaped
X-ray spectrum and the rapid X-ray variability we detect. In addition, extended
emission appears at weak emission levels, including a bridge between the quasar
and the cD galaxy of the cluster.
  The X-ray emission from the intra-cluster medium is weak or absent. None of
the other member galaxies of the cluster to which MR 2251-178 belongs, are
detected in X-rays. However, east of the quasar there is a significant excess
of X-ray sources, several of them without optical counterparts on the UK
Schmidt plates.

achieved using a series of auxiliary tables that store all the input

both weak and strong lensing, using very recent solutions of the Dyer-Roeder
(1973) equation for light propagation in a inhomogeneous universe with a
cosmological constant and up-to-date models for the evolving cosmological
distribution of dark matter halos. We address in particular the effect of a
non-zero cosmological constant, of different density profiles of lenses, and of
finite sizes of lensed sources.
  We show that, if dark matter fluctuations are normalized to the local cluster
abundance, in the presence of a cosmological constant the optical depth for
lensing {\em decreases} compared to the case of an Einstein-de Sitter universe,
because halos in the relevant mass range are less abundant over a large
redshift interval. We also discuss the differences in the magnification
probability distributions produced by Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) and by
Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) density profiles of lenses. We find that the
NFW lens is more efficient for moderate magnifications ($2\lsim A\lsim 4$), and
less efficient for larger magnifications. Moreover, we discuss quantitatively
the maximum magnification, $A_{\rm max}$, that can be achieved in the case of
extended sources (galaxies) with realistic luminosity profiles, taking into
account the possible ellipticity of the lens potential. Finally, we apply our
results to a class of sources following the luminosity evolution typical for a
unified scheme of QSO formation. We find that the lensed source counts at $850
\mu$m can be larger than the unlensed ones by several orders of magnitude at
flux densities $\gta100 $mJy.

the I-H vs. H colour-magnitude diagram. We use this to further constrain the

its redshift. We find that for spatially-flat cosmologies, background lensing
clusters with reasonable mass-to-light ratios lying in the redshift range 0<z<1

interface-controlled dynamics of a long finger is investigated, analytically
and numerically, in two dimensions. An important limit is considered when the
finger dynamics are reducible to the area-preserving motion by curvature. A
free boundary problem for the finger shape is formulated. An asymptotic
perturbation theory is developed that uses the finger aspect ratio as a small
parameter. The leading-order approximation is a modification of ``the Mullins
finger"" (a well-known analytic solution) which width is allowed to slowly vary
with time. This time dependence is described, in the leading order, by an
exponential law with the characteristic time proportional to the (constant)
finger area. The subleading terms of the asymptotic theory are also calculated.
Finally, the finger dynamics is investigated numerically, employing the
Ginzburg-Landau equation with a global conservation law. The theory is in a
very good agreement with the numerical solution.

average, i.e., must exhibit random alternative regimes of reinforcement and
contrarian feedbacks. In contrast, the diagonal terms must be positive and
equal on average to the inverse of the discount factor. Applying the results of
renewal theory for products of random matrices to stochastic recurrence
equations (SRE), we extend the theorem of Lux and Sornette (cond-mat/9910141)
and demonstrate that the tails of the unconditional distributions associated
with such d-dimensional bubble processes follow power laws (i.e., exhibit
hyperbolic decline), with the same asymptotic tail exponent mu<1 for all
assets. The distribution of price differences and of returns is dominated by
the same power-law over an extended range of large returns. This small value
mu<1 of the tail exponent has far-reaching consequences in the non-existence of
the means and variances. Although power-law tails are a pervasive feature of
empirical data, the numerical value mu<1 is in disagreement with the usual
empirical estimates mu approximately equal to 3. It, therefore, appears that
generalizing the model of rational bubbles to arbitrary dimensions does not

simplifies and extends previous treatments. At linear order, we elucidate and
extend slightly a formalism due to Schutz, show how to decompose a general

of motion for the mode amplitudes under the influence of an external force.
Nonlinear effects are added perturbatively via three-mode couplings. We
describe a new, efficient way to compute the coupling coefficients, to zeroth
order in the stellar rotation rate, using spin-weighted spherical harmonics.
  We apply this formalism to derive some properties of the coupling
coefficients relevant to the nonlinear interactions of unstable r-modes in
neutron stars, postponing numerical integrations of the coupled equations of
motion to a later paper. From an astrophysical viewpoint, the most interesting
result of this paper is that many couplings of r-modes to other rotational
modes (modes with zero frequencies in the non-rotating limit) are small: either
they vanish altogether because of various selection rules, or they vanish to
lowest order in the angular velocity. In zero-buoyancy stars, the coupling of
three r-modes is forbidden entirely and the coupling of two r-modes to one
hybrid rotational mode vanishes to zeroth order in rotation frequency. In
incompressible stars, the coupling of any three rotational modes vanishes to
zeroth order in rotation frequency.

relativistic field theory in a general spin--flavor basis. The flavor and spin
variables can be identified with those of effective valence quarks. Conversely,
the spin-flavor description clarifies the structure and dynamical
interpretation of the chiral expansion in effective field theory, and provides
a direct connection between the field theory and the semirelativistic models
for hadrons used in successful dynamical calculations. This allows dynamical
information to be incorporated directly into the chiral expansion. We find, for
example, that the striking success of the additive QM for baryon magnetic
moments is a consequence of the relative smallness of the non-additive

collisions should result in hundreds of produced sphaleron-like gluomagnetic
clusters per unit rapidity. Unlike perturbative gluons (or mini-jets), these
{\em classically unstable} objects promptly decay into several gluons and
quarks in mini-explosions, leading to very rapid entropy generation. This may
help to explain why the QGP seem to be produced at RHIC so early. We further

operators provides the data determining {\hat A}. The study of bulk field
correlators in the presence of twists reveals that the Ocneanu graph quantum

principle that states physics must be invariant under the reciprocity transform
that is heuristically {t,e,q,p}->{t,e,p,-q} where {t,e,q,p} are the time,
energy, position, and momentum degrees of freedom. This implies that there is
reciprocally conjugate relativity principle such that the rates of change of

group of dynamical symmetries that embodies this is the Canonical group C(1,3)

second order chiral effective pion-nucleon Lagrangian proportional to the
low-energy constants $c_{1,2,3,4}$. The resulting isoscalar central potential
vanishes identically. In most cases these $3\pi$-exchange potentials are larger
than the ones generated by the diagrams involving only leading order vertices
due to the large values of $c_{3,4}$ (which mainly represent virtual
$\Delta$-excitation). A similar feature has been observed for the chiral
$2\pi$-exchange. We also give suitable (double-integral) representations for
the spin-spin and tensor potentials generated by the leading-order diagrams
proportional to $g_A^6$ involving four nucleon propagators. In these cases the
Cutkosky rule cannot be used to calculate the spectral-functions in the
infinite nucleon mass limit since the corresponding mass-spectra start with a
non-vanishing value at the $3\pi$-threshold. Altogether, one finds that chiral
$3\pi$-exchange leads to small corrections in the region $r\geq 1.4$ fm where
$1\pi$- and chiral $2\pi$-exchange alone provide a very good strong NN-force as
shown in a recent analysis of the low-energy pp-scattering data-base.

  to akhila_raman@yahoo.com",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  In this paper, Lorentz Transformation(LT) is derived by an alternate method,
using photon clocks, placed at the locations of the concerned events, which are
initially synchronised using a light signal(Einstein synchrony). Then, it is
shown that the second term in the time dilation equation of the LT, is the term
responsible for time travel and further it is shown that this term arises
merely due to non-simultaneous initial clock synchronisation and that this term
does not correspond to any actual time elapsed while timing events, thus ruling
out the possibility of time travel, from the framework of special relativity.
It is also shown that only the first term in the time dilation equation of LT
represents the true time dilation. In other words, it is argued that the time
dilation equation of the LT, corresponds to the actual reading of the clock
which is not necessarily the actual time elapsed while timing an event, the
difference being attributed to the clock synchronisation mechanism.

anesthetics, how they precisely work remains a mystery. We propose a novel
unitary mechanism of general anesthesia verifiable by experiments. In the
proposed mechanism, general anesthetics perturb oxygen pathways in both
membranes and oxygen-utilizing proteins such that the availabilities of oxygen
to its sites of utilization are reduced which in turn triggers cascading
cellular responses through oxygen-sensing mechanisms resulting in general
anesthesia. Despite the general assumption that cell membranes are readily
permeable to oxygen, exiting publications indicate that these membranes are
plausible oxygen transport barriers. The present hypothesis provides a unified
framework for explaining phenomena associated with general anesthesia and
experimental results on the actions of general anesthetics. If verified by
experiments, the proposed mechanism also has other significant medical and
biological implications.

entanglement. Superdense coding allows the encoding, and transmission, of up to
two classical bits of information in a single qubit. In this paper, the maximum
classical channel capacity for states that are not maximally entangled is
derived. Particular schemes are then shown to attain this capacity, firstly for
pairs of qubits, and secondly for pairs of qutrits.

reality in which we are imbedded, and settles for practical rules that describe
connections between our observations. Many physicist have believed that this
renunciation of the attempt describe nature herself was premature, and John von
Neumann, in a major work, reformulated quantum theory as theory of the evolving
objective universe. In the course of his work he converted to a benefit what
had appeared to be a severe deficiency of the Copenhagen interpretation, namely
its introduction into physical theory of the human observers. He used this
subjective element of quantum theory to achieve a significant advance on the
main problem in philosophy, which is to understand the relationship between
mind and matter. That problem had been tied closely to physical theory by the
works of Newton and Descartes. The present work examines the major problems
that have appeared to block the development of von Neumann's theory into a
fully satisfactory theory of Nature, and proposes solutions to these problems.
