with strong signs of recent star formation (i.e. those which show emission
lines) have bluer continua in both the rest frame UV and the
optical/near-infrared. The redder galaxies tend to be more luminous. The SEDs
of actively star forming galaxies become bluer in the mean in the rest-frame UV
at higher redshift, which trend might arise from SED modeling errors. Aside
from this, we discern no change with redshift in the relationship between SED
characteristics and galaxy spectral type based on the strength of narrow
emission and absorption features. There is no evidence in our R-selected sample
that supports the existence of a substantial population of very dusty star
forming galaxies at z < 1.5. The overall pattern of the L(K) - z relationship
suggests that passive evolution at constant stellar mass is a good

transport is driven by gravitational instability at large radii, and
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the hot inner regions. At radii of the
order of 1 AU such discs develop a magnetically layered structure, with
accretion occurring in an ionized surface layer overlying quiescent gas that is
too cool to sustain MHD turbulence. We show that layered discs are subject to a
limit cycle instability, in which accretion onto the protostar occurs in bursts
with an accretion rate of 10^{-5} solar masses / yr, separated by quiescent
intervals where the accretion rate is 10^{-8} solar masses / yr. Such bursts
could lead to repeated episodes of strong mass outflow in Young Stellar
Objects. The transition to this episodic mode of accretion occurs at an early
epoch (t < 1 Myr), and the model therefore predicts that many young
pre-main-sequence stars should have low rates of accretion through the inner
disc. At ages of a few Myr, the discs are up to an order of magnitude more
massive than the minimum mass solar nebula, with most of the mass locked up in
the quiescent layer of the disc at around 1 AU. The predicted rate of low mass
planetary migration is reduced at the outer edge of the layered disc, which
could lead to an enhanced probability of giant planet formation at radii of 1-3
AU.

radiative transfer calculations have been performed to search for an
alternative explanation to the lack of crystalline silicate features in the
spectrum of low mass-loss rate AGB stars. It is shown that due to a temperature
difference between amorphous and crystalline silicates it is possible to
include up to 40% of crystalline silicate material in the circumstellar dust
shell, without the spectra showing the characteristic spectral features. Since
this implies that low mass-loss rate AGB stars might also form crystalline
silicates and deposit them into the Interstellar Medium (ISM), the described
observational selection effect may put the process of dust formation around AGB
stars and the composition of the predominantly amorphous dust in the
Interstellar Medium in a different light. Our model calculations result in a
diagnostic tool to determine the crystallinity of an AGB star with a known

four arms as traced by Galactic HII regions, and the local (Orion) arm which
produces prominent emission features at galactic longitude l approx. 80 and
-100 degrees. A Cosmic Infrared Background of 1.07 MJy/sr is recovered,
consistent with previous determinations. The dust distribution is then used to
calculate absorption in J and K, and the stellar emission in these wavebands is
modeled with two components: a warped exponential disk with a scale length of
0.28 R_sun and a spiral arm component dominated by two arms. This small scale
length is consistent with a maximal disk model for our Galaxy, which is
inconsistent with the cuspy dark matter halos predicted in CDM models. We find
different amplitudes for the warp in the stars and dust, which starts within
the Solar Circle.

moderately small number over a modest sky area, this sample benefits of the
best imaging and photometric data available on high-redshift galaxies.
Multi-waveband photometry allows us to estimate with good accuracy the
redshifts for the majority of these galaxies which lack a spectroscopic
measure. We confirm our previous findings that massive E/S0s tend to disappear
from flux-limited samples at $z>1.4$. This adds to the evidence that the
rest-frame colours and SEDs of the numerous objects found at $0.8<z<1.2$ are
inconsistent with a very high redshift of formation for the bulk of stars,
while they are better consistent with protracted (either continuous or
episodic) star-formation down to $z \le 1$. These results based on high-quality
imaging on a small field can be complemented with data from colour-selected
EROs on much larger sky areas: our claimed demise of E/S0s going from $z=1$ to
$z=1.5$ is paralleled by a similarly fast decrease in the areal density of EROs
when the colour limit is changed from $(R-K)=5$ to $(R-K)=6$ (corresponding to
$z\simeq 1$ and $z\simeq 1.3$ respectively). Altogether, the redshift interval
from 1 to 2 seems to correspond to a very active phase for the assembly of
massive E/S0 galaxies in the field, and also probably one where a substantial

images, with a completeness limit of K=19.75mag, and derive the K-band galaxy
number counts in the range of 14.25 < K < 19.75mag. This is the largest medium
deep K-band survey to date in this magnitude range. The B- and R-band number
counts are also derived, down to completeness limits of B=24.75mag and
R=23.25mag. The K-selected galaxies in this magnitude range are of particular
interest, since some medium deep near-infrared surveys have identified breaks
of both the slope of the K-band number counts and the mean B-K color at
K=17\sim18mag. There is, however, a significant disagreement in the K-band
number counts among the existing surveys. Our large near-infrared selected
galaxy sample allows us to establish the presence of a clear break in the slope
at K=17.0mag from dlogN/dm = 0.64 at brighter magnitudes to dlogN/dm = 0.36 at
the fainter end. We construct no-evolution and passive evolution models, and
find that the passive evolution model can simultaneously fit the B-, R- and
K-band number counts well. The B-K colors show a clear trend to bluer colors
for K > 18mag. We also find that most of the K=18-20mag galaxies have a B-K
color bluer than the prediction of a no-evolution model for an L_* Sbc galaxy,
implying either significant evolution, even for massive galaxies, or the
existence of an extra population of small galaxies.

luminosity ratios than radio-quiet quasars are, at a statistically significant
level. This is consistent with dust-reddened quasars being more common in
radio-selected samples than in optically-selected samples, due to stronger
selection effects against dust-reddened quasars in the latter. We also find a
statistically significant dearth of optically luminous quasars with large
near-infrared-to-optical luminosity ratios. This can be explained in a dust
obscuration model but not in a model where synchrotron emission extends from
the radio into the near-infrared and creates such large ratios. We also find
that selection of quasar candidates from the B-J/J-K color-color diagram,
modelled on the V-J/J-K selection method of Warren, Hewett & Foltz (2000), is

from the classical one. In a system of electron wires driven by an acoustic
wave the sound attenuation strongly decreases with increasing the sound
intensity. However, even in the quantum limit the sound attenuation in the
electron system remains nonzero due to residual scattering by impurities in the
lowest subband. In the case of electron dots formed by two waves moving in the
perpendicular directions, the calculated dissipation vanishes at high sound
intensity because of the fully quantized spectrum. Besides, moving quantum dots
can be formed by a single acoustic wave propagating along a system of etched

high-mobility GaAs quantum wells where the heating can not destroy the quantum

framework of quasiclassical transport theory. It is assumed that the impurity
scattering is of small-angle nature characteristic for currently fabricated
high-mobility heterostructures. The shape of the modulation-induced
magnetoresistivity $\Delta\rho_{xx}$ depends on the value of the parameter
$\gamma\equiv \eta^2 ql/4$, where $\eta$ and $q$ are the strength and the wave
vector of the modulation, and $l$ is the transport mean free path. For
$\gamma\ll 1$, the oscillations are described, in the regime of not too strong
magnetic fields $B$, by perturbation theory in $\eta$ as applied earlier to the
case of one-dimensional modulation. At stronger fields, where $\Delta\rho_{xx}$
becomes much larger than the Drude resistivity, the transport takes the
advection-diffusion form (Rayleigh-B\'enard convection cell) with a large
P\'eclet number, implying a much slower ($\propto B^{3/4}$) increase of the
oscillation amplitude with $B$. If $\gamma\gg 1$, the transport at low $B$ is
dominated by the modulation-induced chaos (rather than by disorder). The
magnetoresistivity drops exponentially and the commensurability oscillations
start to develop at the magnetic fields where the motion takes the form of the
adiabatic drift. Conditions of applicability, the role of the type of disorder,
and the feasibility of experimental observation are discussed.

nonlinear scattering of a plasmino by hard particles in covariant and temporal
gauges is established by using effective Ward identities. The model problem of
the interaction of two infinitely narrow packets with fermion and boson quantum
numbers is considered. The kinematical relations between wave vectors of the
plasmino and plasmon are derived, when the effective pumping over of the plasma
excitation energy from the fermion branch of plasma excitations to the boson
branch and vice versa occur. The expression for the nonlinear Landau damping
rate of a plasmino at rest is found, and a comparison with a plasmino damping
constant obtained within the framework of the hard thermal loop approximation

shown to diverge like $1/\sqrt{q^2}$ near the light cone where $q$ is a

conjecture, we can study various properties of large $N$ CFT by simple
calculations in SUGRA. Recently much attention has been paid to the
Renormalization Group (RG) flow viewed from the SUGRA side. Such RG flow in CFT
is known to be characterized by the c-function which connects CFTs with
different central charges. Therefore, we are interested in deriving this
c-function from SUGRA with the help of AdS/CFT correspondence. To derive the
c-function, we calculate the conformal anomaly (CA) in SUGRA, since it is
closely related to the central charge. In this thesis, we discuss the various
aspects of CA from AdS/CFT duality, especially for the cases of SUGRA in 3 and
5-dimensions which correspond to 2 and 4-dimensional CFTs, respectively. It is
known that the bosonic part of SUGRA with scalar (dilaton) and arbitrary scalar
potential describes the special RG flows in dual quantum field theory. So we
calculate dilaton-dependent CA from dilatonic gravity with arbitrary potential.
After that, we propose candidates of c-functions from such dilatonic gravity
and investigate the properties of them.

satisfies 'axioms at least as strong as those cited by' Wightman [18] and by
Osterwalder and Schrader [14], and by observing that this form of field theory
has no mass gap. The definitions provide a model for relativistic quantum
mechanics which supports a form of relativistic quantum field theory, but which
does not depend on the second quantisation of a 'matter wave'. Continuous laws
of wave mechanics are found in model of discrete particle interactions which
does not involve waves, or the quantisation of interacting fields. Newton's
first law and conservation of momentum are established from the principle of
homogeneity. Maxwell's equations are derived from the simple interaction in
which a Dirac particle emits or absorbs a photon, showing that the renormalised
mass and coupling constant are equal to their bare values. Feynman rules are
calculated for the discrete theory and give the predictions of the standard
renormalised theory. Quark confining interactions are described for qed and for
an adaptation of Yang-Mills theory.

a microscopic object to fractionalize instantly into quasistates and condense
instantly quasistates. This quasistate is equivalent to the eigenfunction. An
object with the fractionalization-condensation is equivalent to the unitary
wavefunction. Nonlocal operation is explicitly required to maintain
communication among all quasistates regardless of distance during the
fractionalization process. Interference effect is explicitly required for the
condensation of quasistates. The collapse of the fractionalization-condensation
is explicitly required when the fractionalization-condensation is disrupted.
The cosmic origin of quantum mechanics is derived from the cyclic
fractionalization-condensation in the cyclic universe, consisting of the
unobservable cosmic vacuum and the observable universe. The cyclic
fractionalization-condensation allows quasistates to appear cyclically rather
than simultaneously. The cosmic vacuum involves the gradual cyclic
fractionalization-condensation between the high energy eleven dimensional and
low energy four dimensional spacetime. The observable universe involves the
drastic cyclic fractionalization-condensation consisting of the cosmic instant
fractionalization (the big bang) into various dimensional particles and the
expansion-contraction by mostly cosmic radiation and gravity. The cosmic
instant fractionalization leads to the microscopic instant
fractionalization-condensation (the standard quantum mechanics) that allows all
quasistates from an object to appear simultaneously.

paradoxes is a unique ability of the human mind still lacking an explanation on

fail to resolve the paradox because of the particle-like (atomistic) nature of
