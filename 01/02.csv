curving to the vertical 0.6 kpc above the galaxy disk, then dispersing in a
spray of droplets each with ionized mass ~1000 sqrt(f) Msun (volume filling

10^43 erg/s that has stagnated in the galaxy disk at radius ~800 pc, flared to
larger radii with increasing height as the balancing ISM pressure reduces above
the disk, and entrained dense clouds into a vortex. Total KE and momentum of
the filaments are (0.4-5)x10^55 sqrt(f) ergs and (1.6-6)x10^47 sqrt(f) dyne s.
A star-forming complex elsewhere in the galaxy shows a striking spray of linear

INTEGRAL mission with the imaging-spectrometer SPI will set the next milestone,
combining improved sensitivity and angular resolution with a considerable
increase in spectral resolution. SPI is expected to provide significant new
information on galactic nucleosynthesis processes and star formation activity,
as traced by the distributions of annihilation radiation and radioactive
isotopes such as 26Al and 60Fe. The unprecedented spectral resolution will
allow the study of dynamic processes in stellar mass ejections and will provide
access to kinematic distance estimates for gamma-ray line sources. The study of
supernovae and their remnants will be prime objectives for SPI observations.
Nearby type Ia SN, within 15 Mpc or so, are in reach of the instrument and a
few such events are expected during the lifetime of INTEGRAL. Young galactic
supernova remnants, possibly hidden by interstellar dust, may be unveiled by
their characteristic gamma-ray line signature from the radioactive decay of
44Ti, as has been demonstrated by COMPTEL for Cas A and possibly RX
J0852.0-4622. Classical novae are also among the SPI targets, which may observe
the gamma-ray lines from radioactive 7Be and 22Na. Such observations can
constrain the physics of the nova explosions and will allow to evaluate their
role as nucleosynthesis sites. The interaction of cosmic rays with the dense
matter in molecular clouds may be another source of gamma-ray lines that is
potentially accessible to SPI. Finally after the SIGMA results on Nova Muscae

search for lines from X novae is another way to participate in the

equation and propose for the $N$-body problem of the equations that are Lorentz
invariant a novel algorithm for the derivation of the equations of motion from
the field equations. It is: 1. Compute a static, spherically symmetric solution
of the field equation. It will be singular at the origin. This will be taken to
be the field generated by a single particle. 2. Move the solution on a
trajectory $ {\psi(t)}$ and apply the instantaneous Lorentz transformation
based on instantaneous velocity $\dot{\psi}(t)$. 3. Take, as first
approximation, the field generated by $N$ particles to be the superposition of
the fields generated by the single particles. 4. Compute the leading part of
the equation. Hopefully, only terms that involves $\ddot{\psi}(t)$ will be
dominant. This is the ``inertial'' part. 5. Compute by the quadratic part of
the equation. This is the agent of the ``force''. 6. Equate for each
singularity, the highest order terms of the singularities that came from the
linear part and the quadratic parts, respectively. This is an equation between
the inertial part and the force. The algorithm was applied to Einstein
equations. The approximate evolution of scalar curvature lends, in turn, to an
invariant scalar equation. The algorithm for it did produce Newton's law of
gravitation. This is, also, the starting point for the embedding the
trajectories in a common field.

addresses a number of concerns raised against these measures. However, the
price of doing this is to introduce context dependence into the definition of
complexity. It is argued that such context dependence is an inherent property
of complexity, and related concepts such as entropy and emergence. Scientists
are uncomfortable with such context dependence, which smacks of subjectivity,
and this is perhaps the reason why little agreement has been found on the
meaning of these terms.

  of Physics","Foundations of Physics 31 (2001) 447",,,"nlin.CD",,"  Periodic orbit quantization requires an analytic continuation of
non-convergent semiclassical trace formulae. We propose two different methods
for semiclassical quantization. The first method is based upon the harmonic
inversion of semiclassical recurrence functions. A band-limited periodic orbit
signal is obtained by analytical frequency windowing of the periodic orbit sum.
The frequencies of the periodic orbit signal are the semiclassical eigenvalues,
and are determined by either linear predictor, Pade approximant, or signal
diagonalization. The second method is based upon the direct application of the
Pade approximant to the periodic orbit sum. The Pade approximant allows the
resummation of the, typically exponentially, divergent periodic orbit terms.
Both techniques do not depend on the existence of a symbolic dynamics, and can
be applied to bound as well as to open systems. Numerical results are presented
for two different systems with chaotic and regular classical dynamics, viz. the
three-disk scattering system and the circle billiard.

in an effective volume of the order of a cubic wavelength, while the modes with
finite angular momentum have a structure that avoids the focal area and have
correspondingly larger effective volume. The ray dynamics indicates that the
fundamental s-wave is robust with respect to small geometrical deformations of
the cavity, while the higher order modes are associated with ray chaos and
short-lived. We discuss the incidence of these results on the modification of
the spontaneous emission dynamics of an emitter placed in such a parabolic dome
microcavity.

a germinal center. The model reduces the germinal center reaction to the
elements considered as essential and embeds proliferation of centroblasts,
point mutations of the corresponding antibody types represented in a shape
space, differentiation to centrocytes, selection with respect to initial
antigens, differentiation of positively selected centrocytes to plasma or
memory cells and recycling of centrocytes to centroblasts. We use exclusively
parameters with a direct biological interpretation such that, once determined
by experimental data, the model gains predictive power. Based on the experiment
of Han et al. (1995b) we predict that a high rate of recycling of centrocytes
to centroblasts is necessary for the germinal center reaction to work reliably.
Furthermore, we find a delayed start of the production of plasma and memory
cells with respect to the start of point mutations, which turns out to be
necessary for the optimization process during the germinal center reaction. The
dependence of the germinal center reaction on the recycling probability is
analyzed.

  Numbers","27 pages, 1 eps figure",,,,"quant-ph nlin.CD",,"  It is shown that in two-state quantum theory, a generic quantum state can be
described by a non-computable real number. In terms of this, the criterion for
measurement outcome is simply and deterministically defined. This demonstration
is based on a construction of the Riemann sphere whose points represent, not
complex numbers, but divergent sequences with bivalent elements. Complex
structure arises from self-similar properties of a set of operators which
generate these sequences. In general, a rotation of (the coordinates of) the
sphere maps a computable real to a non-computable real. This is interpreted
physically as a mapping of a physically-measurable state to a counterfactual
state. Implications for non-locality, null measurements, many worlds and so on,
are discussed. The possible role of the Euler equation as the counterpart of
the Schrodinger equation for real-number quantum state evolution is also
outlined.

Eigenstates of the effective Hamiltonian correspond to cyclic solutions of the

solution can be expressed in terms of the expectation value of the component of
the total angular momentum along the rotating axis, regardless of whether the
solution is explicitly available. For the alkaline atomic electron and a strong
magnetic field, the eigenvalue problem of the effective Hamiltonian is
completely solved, and the geometric phase turns out to be a linear combination
of two solid angles. For a weak magnetic field, the same problem is solved
partly. For a general charged particle, the problem is solved approximately in
a slowly rotating magnetic field, and the geometric phases are also calculated.
