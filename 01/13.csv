the optical counterpart to the transient X-ray pulsar 4U0115+63. The evolution
of emission lines and photometric magnitudes indicates that the Be star
undergoes relatively fast (~ 3-5 yr) quasi-cyclic activity, losing and
reforming its circumstellar disc. We show that the general optical, infrared
and X-ray behaviour can be explained by the dynamical evolution of the viscous
circumstellar disc around the Be star. After each disc-loss episode, the disc
starts reforming and grows until it reaches the radius at which the resonant
interaction of the neutron star truncates it. At some point, the disc becomes
unstable to (presumably radiative) warping and then tilts and starts
precessing. The tilting is very large and disc precession leads to a succession
of single-peaked and shell profiles in the emission lines. Type II X-ray
outbursts take place after the disc has been strongly disturbed and we
speculate that the distortion of the disc leads to interaction with the
orbiting neutron star.
  We discuss the implications of these correlated optical/X-ray variations for
the different models proposed to explain the occurrence of X-ray outbursts in
Be/X-ray binaries. We show that the hypothesis of mass ejection events as the
cause of the spectacular variability and X-ray outbursts is unlikely to be
meaningful for any Be/X-ray binary.

is valid, because of the limited dynamical range this type of simulations can
achieve. In this Letter, we propose to test the hypothesis with high resolution
halo simulations, since the individual halo simulations can resolve much better
the fine structures of the halos and since almost all pairs of particles with
small separations are presumed to be inside virialized halos. We calculated the
mean pair velocity for 14 high resolution halos of $\sim 1$ million particles
in a low-density flat cold dark matter model. The result agrees very well with
the stable clustering prediction within the measurement uncertainty $\sim 30%$
over a large range of scales where the overdensity is $10^3$ to $10^6$. The
accuracy of the test can be improved to $\sim 10%$ if some 100 halos with a
similar resolution are analyzed.

three CDM models with the help of high resolution simulations. Here we apply
the method to the largest available redshift survey, the Las Campanas Redshift
Survey (LCRS). The basic model is to express $P^S(k,\mu)$ as a product of three
factors P^S(k,\mu)=P^R(k)(1+\beta\mu^2)^2 D(k,\mu). Here $\mu$ is the cosine of
the angle between the wave vector and the line of sight. The damping function
$D$ for the range of scales accessible to an accurate analysis of the LCRS is
well approximated by the Lorentz factor D=[1+{1\over
2}(k\mu\sigma_{12})^2]^{-1}. We have investigated different values for $\beta$
($\beta=0.4$, 0.5, 0.6), and measured $P^R(k)$ and $\sigma_{12}(k)$ from
$P^S(k,\mu)$ for different values of $\mu$. The velocity dispersion
$\sigma_{12}(k)$ is nearly a constant from $k=0.5$ to 3 $\mpci$. The average
value for this range is $510\pm 70 \kms$. The power spectrum $P^R(k)$ decreases
with $k$ approximately with $k^{-1.7}$ for $k$ between 0.1 and 4 $\mpci$. The
statistical significance of the results, and the error bars, are found with the
help of mock samples constructed from a large set of high resolution
simulations. A flat, low-density ($\Omega_0=0.2$) CDM model can give a good fit
to the data, if a scale-dependent special bias scheme is used which we have
called the cluster-under-weighted bias (Jing et al.).

Telescope (HST) Survey Strip (or Groth Strip), a 4' by 42' set of 28 contiguous
WFPC2 pointings with I<27. The small size of the HST Point-Spread Function
(PSF) affords both a lower statistical noise, and a much weaker sensitivity to
systematic effects, a crucial limiting factor of cosmic shear measurements. Our
method and treatment of systematic effects were discussed in an earlier paper
(Rhodes, Refregier & Groth 2000). We measure an rms shear of 1.8% on the WFPC2

significant at the 99.5% confidence level (CL), and measure the normalization
of the matter power spectrum to be sigma8*Omega_m^(0.48) = 0.51 (+0.14,-0.17),

nonzero temperature there are two distinct types of excitation: vortices, which
are relevant with renormalization-group eigenvalue 1/2; and non-vortex
unsatisfied bonds, which are strictly marginal and serve only to renormalize
the stiffness coefficient of the underlying free boson. Together these
excitations lead to an unusual form for the corrections to scaling: for
example, the correlation length diverges as \beta \equiv J/kT \to \infty
according to \xi \sim A e^{2\beta} (1 + b\beta e^{-\beta} + ...), where b is a
nonuniversal constant that may nevertheless be determined independently. A
similar result holds for the staggered susceptibility. These results are shown
to be consistent with the anomalous behavior found in the Monte Carlo
simulations of Ferreira and Sokal.

therefore provides a very powerful {\em indirect} evidence against spatial
gradients or temporal variation in the other fundamental physical parameters,
at least 40 orders of magnitude more powerful than direct experimental
constraints. Moreover, a gradient may potentially appear in theories where the
variability of the cosmological constant is connected to an anthropic selection
mechanism, invoked to explain the smallness of this parameter. In the Hubble

While this mechanism demonstrates the existence of this effect, it is too small

and their algebras that have been relevant for our own research, and pose
several open problems. Answers to these problems would contribute substantially
to the further development of the theory.
  The paper treats two main topics: (1) affine semigroups and several covering
properties for them and (2) algebraic properties for the corresponding rings
(Koszul, Cohen-Macaulay, different ``sizes'' of the defining binomial ideals).
We emphasize the special case when the initial data are encoded into lattice
polytopes. The related objects -- polytopal semigroups and algebras -- provide
a link with the classical theme of triangulations into unimodular simplices.
  We have also included an algorithm for checking the semigroup covering
property in the most general setting. Our counterexample to certain covering
conjectures was found by the application of a small part of this algorithm. The
general algorithm could be used for a deeper study of affine semigroups.

sufficiently large characteristic) and $M_t$ the set of $m$-minors of $X$. We
consider two objects: (1) the Ress algebra of the polynomial ring $K[X]$ with
respect to the ideal $I_t$ generated by $M_t$, and (2) the $A_t$ subalgebra of
$K[X]$ generated by $M_t$. Note that $A_t$ is tHE coordinate ring of a
Grassmannian if $t=\min(m,n)$; also the cases $t=1$ and $t=m-1=n-1$ are easily
understood, since $A_t$ is a polynomial ring over $K$ in these cases.
  For both objects we compute the divisor class group and the canonical class.
In particular we determine the Gorenstein rings among the $A_t$. It turns out
that $A_t$ is Gorenstein exactly in the cases listed above and when
$t(m+n)=mn$.
  We use initial methods, based on the straightening law and KRS. They can be
applied to other types of determinantal ideals, too. We do this explicitly for
generic Hankel matrices.

centrality with a rate that increases between SPS and RHIC energies, in

literature relative to $e^+e^-$ pair production in peripheral heavy ion
collisions at ultra-relativistic energies. A controversial issue is the
possible cancellation of Coulomb corrections to the Born term in the pair
production cross-section. Such a cancellation has been observed in a recent
approach based on finding retarded solutions of the Dirac equation, but does
not seem to hold in a perturbative approach. We show in this paper that the two
approaches are in fact calculating different observables: the perturbative
approach gives the exclusive cross-section of single pair production, while the
other method gives the inclusive cross-section.
  We have also performed a thorough study of the electron propagator in the
non-static background field of the two nuclei, the conclusion of which is that
the retarded propagator is in the ultra-relativistic limit a much simpler
object than the Feynman propagator, and can be calculated exactly.

strange hadrons confirms sudden hadronization as the breakup mechanism. A
plausible cause of sudden fireball breakup is the mechanical instability
arising when a quark-gluon plasma phase supercools deeply in its adiabatic
expansion. Applying these ideas, we interpret CERN-SPS and the first results on
