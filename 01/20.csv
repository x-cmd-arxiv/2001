  ESA SP-460",,,"OAN-2001-02","astro-ph",,"  The Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) has shown the complexity of the Galactic
center (GC) Interstellar medium (ISM) detecting, not only large column
densities of warm molecular gas (H2), but the emission of neutral atoms and
ions of low ionization potential (CII, OI, SiII,...) that should arise in
shocked or photon-dominated regions (PDRs). In addition, ISO has also detected
emission from ions like SIII, NeII, ArII, or NII (in some clouds we have even
detected NeIII and OIII) that should arise from HII regions that were
previously unsuspected due to the non-detection of Hydrogen recombination
lines. Here we review some ISO results on the large scale study of the GC ISM
and in particular, on the heating mechanisms of the clouds. Although, shocks
should play an important role on the physics and chemistry of the GC ISM, ISO
shows that the effect of radiation on the heating of the gas cannot be ruled
out with the simple argument that the dust temperature is lower than that of
the gas.

several of these systems with the ultimate aim of constraining the Hubble

B1608+656) have yielded measurements of time delays, from which values of

identified by Zabludoff et al.(1996) in their spectroscopic search for E+A
galaxies using the Las Campanas Redshift Survey, where over 11,000 nearby
galaxies were examined. The five E+A galaxies span a range of environments:
three are in the field and two are in clusters. Only one system was detected in
HI emission, the field E+A galaxy EA1, with a total flux of 0.30 +/- 0.02 Jy
km/s and an HI mass of (3.5 +/- 0.2) 10^9 h^(-2) M_sun. The HI morphology and
kinematics of EA 1 suggest a galaxy-galaxy interaction, with a dynamical age of
about 6 x 10^8 h^(-1) yr inferred from the HI tail lengths and velocities. This
age estimate is consistent with the interpretation drawn from optical
spectroscopy that starbursts in E+A galaxies began (and subsequently ended)
within the last 10^9 yr. Our HI detection limits are such that if the other
E+A's in our sample had the HI properties of EA 1, we would have detected (or
marginally detected) them. We conclude that E+A galaxies have a range of HI
properties. None of the galaxies were detected in radio continuum emission,
with upper limits to the radio power of about 10^21 h^(-2) W/Hz. Our limits
exclude the possibility that these E+A's are dust-enshrouded massive starburst
galaxies, but are insufficient to exclude modest star formation rates of less
than a few h^(-2) M_sun per yr.

from the synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons in the high energy tail
of hot electrons in continuous conical jet. The jet is assumed to be produced
by the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) and maintains ion and electron
temperatures constant in the case of adiabatic steady conical expansion. The
flat spectrum is result of self-absorbed synchrotron emission by relativistic
thermal electrons. We find that the critical frequency at which the radiation
becomes optically thin declines along the jet. The emission observed at higher
frequencies originates at smaller distance, closer to the base of the jet. The
highest cut-off frequency of the flat spectrum is at the base of the jet, and
is determined by the physics of the ADAF and the position of the jet formation.
We assert that it is a characteristic of the ADAF in black hole X-ray binaries
that a continuous steady outflow is formed and causes the observed flat
spectrum in the low/hard state. The observed synchrotron emission consists of
the flat spectral component from the jet and the steep spectral component from
the ADAF. The flat spectral component extends from infrared to radio
wavelengths, while the steep spectral component with the 2/5 spectral slope
extends from infrared to shorter wavelengths, it will be dominated by the
thermal emission from companion star.

illustrated by simulated generation of a ring current with winding number two.
While solitons can be generated in quasi-1D tori, we show the even more robust
generation of hybrid, solitonic vortices (svortices) in a regime of wider
confinement. Svortices are vortices confined to essentially one-dimensional
dynamics, which obey a similar phase-offset--velocity relationship as solitons.
Marking the transition between solitons and vortices, svortices are a distinct

  282 (2002)",,,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  This chapter deals with charged polymers (polyelectrolytes) in solution and
at surfaces. The behavior of polyelectrolytes is markedly different from that
of neutral polymers. In bulk solutions, i.e. disregarding the surface effect,
there are two unique features to charged polymers: first, due to the presence
of long-ranged electrostatic repulsion between charged monomers, the polymer
conformations are much more extended, giving rise to a very small overlap
concentration and high solution viscosity. Second, the presence of a large
number of counter-ions increases the osmotic pressure of polyelectrolyte
solutions, making such polymers water soluble as is of great importance to many
applications. At surfaces, the same interplay between monomer-monomer repulsion
and counter-ion degrees of freedom leads to a number of special properties. In
particular, the adsorption behavior depends on both the concentration of
polymers and added salt in the bulk. We first describe the adsorption behavior
of single polyelectrolyte molecules, and discuss the necessary conditions to
obtain an adsorbed layer and characterize its width. Depending on the stiffness
of the polyelectrolyte, the layer can be flat and compressed or coiled and
extended. We then proceed and discuss the adsorption of polyelectrolytes from
semi-dilute solutions. Mean-field theory profiles of polyelectrolyte adsorption
are calculated as function of surface charge density (or surface potential),
the amount of salt in the system and the charge fraction on the chains. The
phenomenon of charge inversion is reviewed and its relevance to the formation
of multilayers is explained. The review ends with a short overview of the
behavior of grafted polyelectrolytes.

reduction technique, a large number of simple nonequilibrium limited mobility
solid-on-solid growth models. We find that d=2+1 dimensional surface growth in
several noise reduced models (most notably the Wolf-Villain and the
Larger-Curvature model) exhibits spectacular quasi-regular mound formation with
slope selection in their dynamical surface morphology. The mounding instability
in these epitaxial growth models does not involve the Ehrlich-Schwoebel step
edge diffusion barrier. The mounded morphology in these growth models arises
from the interplay between the line tension along step edges in the plane
parallel to the average surface and the suppression of noise and island
nucleation. The line tension tends to stabilize some of the step orientations
that coincide with in-plane high symmetry crystalline directions, and thus the
mounds that are formed assume quasi-regular structures. The noise reduction
technique developed originally for Eden type models can be used to control the
stochastic noise and enhance diffusion along the step edge, which ultimately
leads to the formation of quasi-regular mounds during growth. We show that by
increasing the diffusion surface length together with supression of nucleation
and deposition noise, one can obtain a self-organization of the pyramids in
quasi-regular patterns.

expressions for corresponding local frequencies as well as for reflection and
transmission coefficients. We show that the presence of the defects leads to
resonant tunneling of the electromagnetic waves via local polariton modes

  13 - 19, 2000",,,,"hep-ex",,"  Lattice gauge calculations predict the existence of glueballs. In particular
a scalar glueball is firmly expected at a mass of about 1730 MeV. This
prediction has led to an intense study of scalar isoscalar interactions and to
the discovery of new meson resonances. The number of scalar states observed
seems to exceed the number of states which can be accommodated in the quark
model even when two states, the a_0(980) and f_0(980), are interpreted as K
Kbar bound states and are removed from the list. However, none of these states
has a decay pattern which is consistent with that of a pure glueball. A
reasonable interpretation of the number of states and of their decay pattern is
found only when mixing of scalar q qbar states with the scalar glueball is
taken into account.
  In this paper we scrutinize the evidence for these states and their
production characteristics. The f_0(1370) - a cornerstone of all qbar
q-glueball mixing scenarios - is shown to be likely of non-qbar q nature. The
remaining scalar states then do fit into a nonet classification. If this
interpretation should be correct there would be no room for resonant scalar
gluon-gluon interactions, no room for the scalar glueball.
  We also discuss the status of mesons with exotic quantum numbers, of mesons
which cannot possibly have qbar q structure, and argue that these are, most
likely, four-quark states and not excitations of the gluon string providing the

Close to the deconfinement phase transition the qualitative features of this

3-state Potts model. We solve the complex action problem in the Potts model by
using a cluster algorithm. The improved estimator for the $\mu$-dependent part
of the Boltzmann factor is real and positive and is used for importance
sampling. We localize the critical endpoint of the first order deconfinement
phase transition line and find consistency with universal 3-d Ising behavior.

$A_\gamma$ in $\vec{n} + p \to d + \gamma$ at threshold, which arises due to
the weak parity non-conserving interactions. Instead of appealing to Siegert's
theorem, transition operators up to next-to-leading chiral order are derived
and the corresponding amplitudes are evaluated with the Argonne $v_{18}$
wavefunctions. In addition to the impulse contribution, both parity-conserving
and parity-non-conserving two-body one-pion-exchange diagrams appear up to this
order. Our prediction for the asymmetry is $A_\gamma = - 0.10 \hpiNN$, which is
close to the Siegert's theorem based result, $A_\gamma \simeq -0.11 \hpiNN$.
This illustrates that HBChPT is effective in the parity-non-conserving physics.

decoherent histories approach to calculate the probability for crossing the

difficulties in assigning crossing times arise here as difficulties in
satisfying the consistency (no-interference) condition. This can be overcome by
introducing an environment to produce decoherence, and probabilities exhibiting
the expected classical limit are obtained. The probabilities are, however,
dependent to some degree on the decohering environment. The results are
compared with a recently proposed irreversible detector model. A third method
is introduced, involving continuous quantum measurement theory. Some closely
related work on the interpretation of the wave function in quantum cosmology is
