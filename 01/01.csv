the landing of man on the Moon, the end of the Cold War, spectacular comets,
and so on. However, as detailed in the paper, not all of them affected in the

  The size of the vast majority of astronomy-related organizations is
relatively small, with again some differences between Western Europe and North

are produced by highly relativistic jets emitted in core collapse supernova
explosions (SNe). The result of the event, probably, is not just a compact
object plus a spherical ejecta: within days, a fraction of the parent star
falls back to produce a thick accretion disk around the compact object.
Instabilities in the disk induce sudden collapses with ejection of highly
relativistic ``cannonballs'' of plasma, similar to those ejected by
microquasars. The jet of cannonballs exit the supernova shell/ejecta reheated
by their collision with it, emitting highly forward-collimated radiation which
is Doppler shifted to $\gamma$-ray energy. Each cannonball corresponds to an
individual pulse in a GRB. They decelerate by sweeping up the ionised
interstellar matter in front of them, part of which is accelerated to
cosmic-ray energies and emits synchrotron radiation: the afterglow. The
Cannonball Model cannot predict the timing sequence of these pulses, but it
fares very well in describing the total energy, energy spectrum, and
time-dependence of the individual $\gamma$-ray pulses and afterglows. It also
predicts that GRB pulses are accompanied by detectable short pulses of TeV
neutrinos and sub TeV $\gamma$-rays, that are much more energetic and begin and
peak a little earlier.

flares, plasmoid-induced-reconnection and fractal reconnection are proposed and
examined. We first briefly summarize recent solar observations that give us
hints on the role of plasmoid (flux rope) ejections in flare energy release. We
then discuss the plasmoid-induced-reconnection model, which is an extention of
the classical two-ribbon-flare model which we refer to as the CSHKP model. An
essential ingredient of the new model is the formation and ejection of a
plasmoid which play an essential role in the storage of magnetic energy (by
inhibiting reconnection) and the induction of a strong inflow into reconnection
region. Using a simple analytical model, we show that the plasmoid ejection and
acceleration are closely coupled with the reconnection process, leading to a
nonlinear instability for the whole dynamics that determines the macroscopic
reconnection rate uniquely. Next we show that the current sheet tends to have a
fractal structure via the following process path: tearing, sheet thinning,
Sweet- Parker sheet, secondary tearing, further sheet thinning... These
processes occur repeatedly at smaller scales until a microscopic plasma scale
(either the ion Larmor radius or the ion inertial length) is reached where
anomalous resistivity or collisionless reconnection can occur. The current
sheet eventually has a fractal structure with many plasmoids (magnetic islands)
of different sizes. When these plasmoids are ejected out of the current sheets,
fast reconnection occurs at various different scales in a highly time dependent
manner. Finally, a scenario is presented for fast reconnection in the solar
corona on the basis of above plasmoid-induced-reconnection in a fractal current
sheet.

solution to the strong CP problem necessarily contain also the axino, the

supersymmetry-breaking scale and can be much smaller. The axino is therefore an
intriguing candidate for a stable superpartner. In a previous Letter [1] it was
shown that axinos are a natural candidate for cold dark matter in the Universe
when they are generated non-thermally through out-of-equilibrium neutralino
decays. Here, we extend the study of non-thermal production and include a
competing thermal production mechanism through scatterings and decays of
particles in the plasma. We identify axino masses in the range of tens of MeV
to several GeV (depending on the scenario) as corresponding to cold axino
relics if the reheating temperature $\treh$ is less than about
$5\times10^4\gev$. At higher $\treh$ and lower mass, axinos could constitute
warm dark matter. In the scenario with axinos as relics, the gravitino problem
finds a natural solution. The lightest superpartner of the Standard Model
spectrum remains effectively stable in high-energy detectors but may be either

incommensurate or irregular quantum states. As a first (typical) example we
consider a single electron which is strongly coupled with phonons on a $1D$
chain of atoms --- the (Rashba)--Holstein polaron model. In the adiabatic
approximation this system is conventionally described by the DNSE. Another
relevant example is that of superconducting states in layered superconductors
described by the same DNSE. Amongst many other applications the typical example
for a classical lattice is a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators. We
present the exact energy spectrum of this model in the strong coupling limit
and the corresponding wave function. Using this as a starting point we go on to
calculate the wave function for moderate coupling and find that the energy
eigenvalue of these structures of the wave function is in exquisite agreement
with the exact strong coupling result. This procedure allows us to obtain
(numerically) exact solutions of the DNSE directly. When applied to our typical
example we find that the wave function of an electron on a deformable lattice
(and other quantum or classical discrete systems) may exhibit incommensurate
and irregular structures. These states are analogous to the periodic,
quasiperiodic and chaotic structures found in classical chaotic dynamics.

nuclear matter saturation in non-relativistic studies, it does not do so in
relativistic studies. The reason behind this is the role of $M^*$, the sum of
nucleon mass and its attractive self-energy in nuclear matter. Yet
nonrelativistic calculations at a certain level of approximation are far less
difficult than comparative relativistic calculation. Naturally the question
arises if one can modify a nonrelativistic method, say, the lowest order
Brueckner theory (LOBT), to reproduce approximately the results of a
relativistic calculation. While a many body effect, the role of $M^*$ is
intrinsically relativistic. It cannot be simulated by adding multi-body forces
in a nonrelativistic calculation. Instead, we examine if adding a set of
recipes to LOBT can be useful for the purpose. We point out that the
differences in the results arise principally from two reasons - first, the role
of $M^*$ and second, the disappearance in a relativistic treatment of the gap
in the hole and particle energy spectra, present in LOBT. In this paper we show
that LOBT, modified by {\it recipes} to remove these two reasons, generates
results quite close to those of Dirac-Brueckner theory.

laser active dyes. We embedded pyridine 2 molecules as a representative of a
commercially available dye which fits into the channel pores of the host
matrix. Many efficient dye molecules, such as rhodamines, do not fit into the
pores. But the amount of encapsulated dyes can be increased by modifying the
structure of the dyes such that they match the host templates. The resulting
microlasers have properties that depend on size and shape of the
microresonators, and we discuss a model for microscopic hexagonal ring
resonators. In terms of pump needed to reach lasing threshold molecular sieve
microlasers are comparable to VCSELs. For dyes which fit into the pores we
observed a partial regeneration of photo-induced damage.

trace-preserving (i.e., stochastic) maps from 2x2 matrices to 2x2 matrices.
These conditions allow one to easily check any trace-preserving map for
complete positivity. We also determine explicitly all extreme points of this
set, and give a useful parameterization after reduction to a certain canonical
form. This allows a detailed examination of an important class of non-unital
extreme points which can be characterized as having exactly two images on the
Bloch sphere.
  We also discuss a number of related issues about the images and the geometry
of the set of stochastic maps, and show that any stochastic map on 2x2 matrices
can be written as a convex combination of two ""generalized"" extreme points.

with moderate imperfections is able to simulate accurately the unstable chaotic

systems of a few qubits.

"quant-ph/0101005","Gilles Brassard","Gilles Brassard","Quantum Communication Complexity (A Survey)","16 pages, LaTeX, no figures. Survey paper",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Can quantum communication be more efficient than its classical counterpart?
Holevo's theorem rules out the possibility of communicating more than n bits of
classical information by the transmission of n quantum bits --- unless the two
parties are entangled, in which case twice as many classical bits can be
communicated but no more. In apparent contradiction, there are distributed
computational tasks for which quantum communication cannot be simulated
efficiently by classical means. In extreme cases, the effect of transmitting
quantum bits cannot be achieved classically short of transmitting an
exponentially larger number of bits.
  In a similar vein, can entanglement be used to save on classical
communication? It is well known that entanglement on its own is useless for the
transmission of information. Yet, there are distributed tasks that cannot be
accomplished at all in a classical world when communication is not allowed, but
that become possible if the non-communicating parties share prior entanglement.
This leads to the question of how expensive it is, in terms of classical
communication, to provide an exact simulation of the spooky power of
entanglement.
