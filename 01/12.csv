identification is based on X-ray contour maps overlaid on optical images taken
from the Digitized Sky Survey. We have derived the basic spectral and timing
properties of the X-ray detected Seyfert galaxies. For Seyfert 1 galaxies a
strong correlation between photon index and X-ray luminosity is detected. We
confirm the presence of generally steeper X-ray continua in narrow-line Seyfert
1 galaxies (NLS1s) compared to broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. Seyfert 2
galaxies show photon indices similar to those of NLS1s. Whereas a tendency for
an increasing X-ray luminosity with increasing interaction strength is found
for Seyfert 1 galaxies, such a correlation is not found for Seyfert 2 galaxies.
For Seyfert 1 galaxies we found also a strong correlation for increasing
far-infrared luminosity with increasing interaction strength. Both NLS1s and
Seyfert 2 galaxies show the highest values of far-infrared luminosity compared
to Seyfert 1 galaxies, suggesting that NLS1s and Seyfert 2 galaxies host strong
(cirumnuclear) starformation. For variable Seyfert galaxies we present the
X-ray light curves obtained from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey and from ROSAT PSPC
and HRI pointed observations. Besides the expected strong short- and long-term
X-ray variability in Seyfert 1 galaxies, we find indications for X-ray flux
variations in Seyfert 2 galaxies.

milli-arcsec, with the binary axis at position angle 130+/-10 degrees. The
latter is consistent with previous estimates made by indirect methods. The
binary separation is consistent with a previous estimate of 50 au if the
distance is 1250+/-280 pc. Temperature and density diagnostics show two
distinct regions in the surrounding nebula, with a cool wedge to the
south-west. An extinction map indicates the true interstellar extinction to be
no more than E(B-V) = 0.35. This is consistent with a minimum distance of
approximatelly 700 pc, but this would be reduced if there is a circumstellar
contribution to the minimum in the extinction map. The extinction map also
suggests a patchy dust distribution. We suggest that a southern concentration
of dust and the south-west wedge are associated with the cool component wind.
Alternatively, the southern dust concentration is the cause of the cool wedge,
as it shields part of the nebula from the hot component radiation field.

described in terms of a two-fluid model, where one fluid is the neutron

neutron stars, and the other fluid represents a conglomerate of all other
constituents (crust nuclei, protons, electrons, etc.). In our model, we
incorporate the non-dissipative interaction due to the so-called entrainment
effect, whereby the momentum of one constituent (e.g. the neutrons) carries
along part of the mass of the other constituent. We show that there is no
independent set of propagating g-modes in a superfluid neutron star core. We
also approach the toroidal pulsation modes of a slowly rotating superfluid

luminous galaxies can arise from the multiple mergers experienced by dark
matter halos in hierarchical structure formation models, even if only a small
fraction of these galaxies harbor SMBHs at high redshifts. We illustrate this
possibility using cosmological Monte Carlo simulations of the merger history of
dark matter halos and their associated SMBHs. In our most extreme models, in
order to populate nearly every bright galaxy with a SMBH at z=0, only a few
percent of the halos with virial temperatures above 10^4 K are required to
harbor a SMBH at high redshift. This possibility must be included in studies of
the luminosity function and the clustering properties of quasars. We predict
the number of SMBH merger events that are detectable by the gravitational wave
experiment LISA, as a function of redshift, out to z=5. Although the event
rates can be significantly reduced in scenarios with rare SMBHs, a minimum of
\~10 detectable merger events per year is predicted if SMBH binaries coalesce
efficiently. The observed distribution of events with redshift could yield
valuable information on the SMBH formation process. If SMBH binaries do not
coalesce, we find that at least several SMBH slingshot ejections probably
occurred from z=5 to the present in each galaxy more massive than ~10^11 Msun
at z=0. Although our results are sensitive to the minimum cooling mass assumed
for the formation of SMBHs, we expect the qualitative predictions of our models
to be robust.

forming stars due to lack of adequate coolants, contain a large fraction of
baryonic mass at cosmological reionization. We show that the reionization of
the universe at z=10-20 has an interesting physical effect on these halos. The
external radiation field causes a synchronous inward propagation of an
ionization front towards each halo, resulting in an inward, convergent shock.
The resident gas of mass Mb~10^4-10^7 Msun in low spin (initial dimensionless
spin parameter lambda <= 0.01) halos with a velocity dispersion sigmav <=
11km/s would be compressed by a factor of ~100 in radius and form self
-gravitating baryonic systems. Under the assumption that such compressed
gaseous systems fragment to form stars, the final stellar systems will have a
size 2-40pc, velocity dispersion 1-10km/s and a total stellar mass of M*
10^3-10^6 Msun. The characteristics of these proposed systems seem to match the
observed properties of halo globular clusters. The expected number density is
consistent with the observed number density of halo globular clusters. The
observed mass function of slope ~-2 at the high mass end is predicted by the
model. Strong correlation between velocity dispersion and luminosity (or
surface brightness) and lack of correlation between velocity dispersion and
size, in agreement with observations, are expected. Metallicity is, on average,
expected to be low and should not correlate with any other quantities of
globular clusters, except that a larger dispersion of metallicity among
globular clusters is expected for larger galaxies. The observed trend of
specific frequency with galaxy type may be produced in the model. We suggest
that these stellar systems are seen as halo globular clusters today.

(${\Pi}, {\Theta}, W$) = (-3.5, 230, -3) km s$^{-1}$, NGC 6553 follows the mean
rotation of both disk and bulge stars at a Galactocentric distance of 2.7 kpc.
While the kinematics of the cluster is consistent with either a bulge or a disk
membership, the virtual identity of its stellar population with that of the
bulge cluster NGC6528 makes its bulge membership more likely. The astrometric
accuracy is high enough for providing a measure of the bulge proper motion
dispersion and confirming its rotation. A selection of stars based on the
proper motions produced an extremely well defined cluster color-magnitude
diagram (CMD), essencially free of bulge stars. The improved turnoff definition
in the decontaminated CMD confirms an old age for the cluster (~13 Gyr)
indicating that the bulge underwent a rapid chemical enrichment while being
built up at in the early Universe. An additional interesting feature of the
cluster color-magnitude diagram is a significant number of blue stragglers
stars, whose membership in the cluster is firmly established from their proper
motions.

STJs at the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope on La Palma. The detector
presently provides individual photon arrival time accuracy to about 5 $\mu$s,
and a wavelength resolution of about 60 nm at 500 nm, with each array element
capable of counting up to $\sim$5000 photons s$^{-1}$. The data allow us to
place accurate constraints on the accretion geometry from our time- and
spectrally-resolved monitoring, especially of the eclipse ingress and egress.
We find that there are two small accretion regions, located close to the poles
of the white dwarf. The positions of these are accurately constrained, and show
little movement from eclipse to eclipse, even over a number of years. The
colour of the emission from the two regions appears similar, although their
X-ray properties are known to be significantly different: we argue that the
usual accretion shock may be absent at the non-X-ray emitting region, and
instead the flow here interacts directly with the white dwarf surface;
alternatively, a special grazing occultation of this region is required. There
is no evidence for any quasi-periodic oscillations on time-scales of the order
of seconds, consistent with relatively stable cyclotron cooling in each
accretion region.

described, and vertically averaged solutions for the radial structure are
given. The emission of the standard disk is discussed using different
approximations, and it is compared to the observations. This leads to the
conclusion that more complex models are required, such as the irradiated disk
and the disk-corona models. The advantage of this last model is that it
explains the overall UV-X spectral distribution. In the framework of these disk
models, the profile, intensity, and variability properties of the X-ray iron
line can be explained by reprocessing at the surface of the cold disk very
close to the black hole (the ""relativistic disk model""). An alternative
possibility is discussed, where the UV-X continuum is produced by a

measurement on a sky ring is able to separate the B and E-mode patterns, we

unique, in that it enables the B and E modes to be separately measured in a
simple and clean manner. The separation of B and E modes can in principle be
achieved even with a single-polarization detector of arbitrary beam pattern.
Based on this premise, a specific observing strategy is suggested, where the
telescope scans along a sky circle with the polarimeter axis always oriented to
a fixed direction with respect to the radial direction of the sky circle. The
observational strategy for B-mode measurements can further be refined by
choosing appropriate beam sizes to suppress the accidental E-mode leakage. We
present the expected variances of the measured E and B-mode surface-brightness
fluctuations as functions of the sky annulus radius and beam size. The measured
peak power is expected to be up to 10% of the total power contained in the CMB
polarization fluctuations for both B and E modes. The temperature-polarization,

different initial conditions, a regular system converges to the same final
trajectory, whereas a chaotic system follows two distinct trajectories
exponentially diverging from each other. In spite of these differences, regular

transient times. This is not a profitable property in what concerns
evolutionary strategies, where the eternal search for new forms, better than
the current one, is imperative. That is why evolutionary dynamic systems tend
to tune themselves in very particular situations in between regular and chaotic

crystal model has been investigated by using a version of density-functional
theory (DFT). We have focused on the case of a nematic confined by opposing
flat surfaces, in slab geometry (slit pore), which favor planar molecular
alignment (parallel to the surface) and homeotropic alignment (perpendicular to
the surface), respectively. The spatial dependence of the tilt angle of the
director with respect to the surface normal has been studied, as well as the
tensorial order parameter describing the molecular order around the director.
For a pore of given width, we find that, for weak surface fields, the alignment
of the nematic director is perpendicular to the surface in a region next to the
surface favoring homeotropic alignment, and parallel along the rest of the
pore, with a interface separating these regions (S phase). For strong surface
fields, the director is distorted uniformly, the tilt angle exhibiting a linear
dependence with the distance normal to the surface (L phase). Our calculations
reveal the existence of a first-order transition between the two director
configurations, which is driven by changes in the surface field strength, and
also by changes in the pore width. In the latter case the transition occurs,
for a given surface field, between the S phase for narrow pores and the L phase
for wider pores. A link between the L-S transition and the anchoring transition
observed for the semi-infinite case is proposed. We also provide calculations
with a phenomenological approach that yields the same main result that DFT in
the scale length where this is valid.

initially phase separated lattice depends crucially on the microscopic
mechanism which drives the disordering, such as Kawasaki dynamics or vacancy
mediated disordering. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations show unexpected ``dips'' in
the structure factors, which mean-field theory completely fails to capture. The
disordering via vacancies is slower by a surprisingly large constant factor
compared to Kawasaki dynamics. A phenomenological model is introduced in order
to understand the dips, and an analytical solution of Kawasaki dynamics is
derived, in excellent agreement with simulations. An outline is given on how to
extend the analytical solution to the more complicated case of a wandering

shared resources is a very difficult task. Many commercial systems record
essential events during system execution for post-mortem analysis. However, the
event traces of large and long-running systems can be quite voluminous.
Analysis of such event traces to identify sources of incorrect behavior can be
very tedious, error-prone, and inefficient. In this paper, we propose a novel
technique of slicing event traces as a means of reducing the number of events
for analysis. This technique identifies events that may have influenced
observed incorrect system behavior. In order to recognize influencing events
several types of dependencies between events are identified. These dependencies
are determined automatically from an event trace. In order to improve the
precision of slicing we propose to use additional dependencies, referred to as
cause-effect dependencies, which can further reduce the size of sliced event
traces. Our initial experience has shown that this slicing technique can
significantly reduce the size of event traces for analysis.

debugging automation tools based on precise program behavior models. The
program behavior model is defined as a set of events (event trace) with two
basic binary relations over events -- precedence and inclusion, and represents
the temporal relationship between actions. A language for the computations over
event traces is developed that provides a basis for assertion checking,
debugging queries, execution profiles, and performance measurements. The
approach is nondestructive, since assertion texts are separated from the target
program source code and can be maintained independently. Assertions can capture
the dynamic properties of a particular target program and can formalize the
general knowledge of typical bugs and debugging strategies. An event grammar
provides a sound basis for assertion language implementation via target program
automatic instrumentation. An implementation architecture and preliminary
experiments with a prototype assertion checker for the C programming language
are discussed.

the (M5, M2) bound state one by a finite Lorentz boost along a M5-brane
direction perpendicular to the M2-brane. Given the (M5, M2) bound state as a
defining system for OM theory and the above relation between this system and
the (M5, M2, M2', MW) bound state, we test the recently proposed V-duality
conjecture in OM theory. Insisting to have a decoupled OM theory, we find that
the allowed Lorentz boost has to be infinitesimally small, therefore resulting
in a family of OM theories related by Galilean boosts. We argue that such
related OM theories are equivalent to each other. In other words, V-duality
holds for OM theory as well. Upon compactification on either an electric or a
`magnetic' circle (plus T-dualities as well), the V-duality for OM theory gives
the known one for either noncommutative open string theories or noncommutative
Yang-Mills theories. This further implies that V-duality holds in general for
the little m-theory without gravity.

implies that the resulting theory embodies factorized gauge and supersymmetry

theory is determined by the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions, rather than by
the requirement of supersymmetry. As already shown for the case without
hypermultiplets, this procedure does not fix a quartic coupling for the
gauginos. With respect to these previous results, the inclusion of charged
hypermultiplets gives additional terms in the supersymmetry anomaly. We also
consider the case in which abelian vectors are present. As in the absence of
hypermultiplets, abelian vectors allow additional couplings. Finally, we apply
the Pasti-Sorokin-Tonin prescription to this model.

  4-7, 2000. Forthcoming in Philosophy of Science",,,,"quant-ph hep-th",,"  The aim of this paper is twofold: First, to present an examination of the
principles underlying gauge field theories. I shall argue that there are two
principles directly connected to the two well-known theorems of Emmy Noether
concerning global and local symmetries of the free matter-field Lagrangian, in
the following referred to as ""conservation principle"" and ""gauge principle"".
Since both these express nothing but certain symmetry features of the free
field theory, they are not sufficient to derive a true interaction coupling to
a new gauge field. For this purpose it is necessary to advocate a third, truly
empirical principle which may be understood as a generalization of the
equivalence principle. The second task of the paper is to deal with the
ontological question concerning the reality status of gauge potentials in the
light of the proposed logical structure of gauge theories. A nonlocal
interpretation of topological effects in gauge theories and, thus, the
non-reality of gauge potentials in accordance with the generalized equivalence
principle will be favoured.

impossible. However, entangling an unknown qubit with two types of reference
states is possible. To achieve this, we introduce a new class of states called
zero sum amplitude (ZSA) multipartite, pure entangled states for qubits and
study their salient features. Using shared-ZSA state, local operation and
classical communication we give a protocol for creating multipartite entangled
states of an unknown quantum state with two types of reference states at remote
places. This provides a way of encoding an unknown pure qubit state into a
multiqubit entangled state. We quantify the amount of classical and quantum
resources required to create universal entangled states. This is possibly a
strongest form of quantum bit hiding with multiparties.

  Measurements","10 pages,3 figures,contribution in memory of Dan Walls",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We show that quantum mechanics predicts an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox
(EPR), and also a contradiction with local hidden variable theories, for photon
number measurements which have limited resolving power, to the point of
imposing an uncertainty in the photon number result which is macroscopic in
absolute terms. We show how this can be interpreted as a failure of a new, very
strong premise, called macroscopic local realism. We link this premise to the
Schrodinger-cat paradox. Our proposed experiments ensure all fields incident on
each measurement apparatus are macroscopic. We show that an alternative
measurement scheme corresponds to balanced homodyne detection of quadrature
phase amplitudes. The implication is that where either EPR correlations or
failure of local realism is predicted for continuous variable (quadrature phase
amplitude) measurements, one can perform a modified experiment which would lead
to conclusions about the much stronger premise of macroscopic local realism.

A probability distribution of the phase-averaged electric field amplitudes with

  continuous variable entanglement: a definitive signature of a Schr\""odinger
  cat","8 pages,2 figures, presented in postdeadline session
  CLEO(Europe)September,2000",,,,"quant-ph",,"  In the Schr\""odinger-cat gedanken experiment a cat is in a quantum
superposition of two macroscopically distinct states, alive and dead.The
paradoxical interpretation of quantum mechanics is that the cat is not in one
state or the other, alive or dead, immediately prior to its measurement.
Because of this apparent defiance of macroscopic reality, quantum
superpositions of states macroscopically distinct have generated much interest.
Here we address the issue of proving a contradiction with macroscopic reality
objectively, through the testable predictions of quantum mechanics. We consider
the premises of macroscopic reality (that the ``cat'' is either ``dead'' or
``alive'', the measurement indicating which) and macroscopic locality (that
simultaneous measurements some distance away cannot induce the macroscopic
change, ``dead'' to ``alive'' and vice versa, to the ``cat''). The predictions
of quantum mechanics for certain states, generated using states exhibiting
continuous variable entanglement, are shown to be incompatible with the
predictions of all theories based on this dual premise. Our proof is along the
lines of Bell's theorem, but where all relevant measurements give
macroscopically distinct results.
