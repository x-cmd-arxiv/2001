that the bispectrum for the simulated string model we used is not observable.

quantum system will perceive his world. It is argued that because of the
indistinguishability of quantum particles, a coherent state will appear to an
observer within the system like a singularity. As superposition is lost, space
appears to expand, although to the outsider it is merely the collapse of the
wave function. Implications of these ideas to cosmology are considered. The
superluminal expansion of space provides a basis to understand inflationary
cosmologies. This expansion may be taken to be equivalent to a much faster
speed of light during the inflationary period. These ideas can be tested by
checking for `higher' speed of light from photons emitted by decohering atoms.

see evidence for shock-acceleration of the emission-line gas in the extended
regions of all the galaxies, even in the largest radio sources of our sample,
in which the radio hot spots have passed the extended gas of the galaxies. The
extended regions present highly disturbed kinematics (line-splitting and/or
underlying broad components), which are difficult to explain if we do not
consider a strong interaction between the radio-emitting components and the
ambient gas. However, the dominant ionization mechanism of the line-emitting
gas remains uncertain. We have compared the optical diagnostic line ratios of
the galaxies in our sample with both AGN-photoionization and shock-ionization
models. We find a lack of consistency in explaining the main ionization
mechanism of the emission-line gas. This suggest that, if the extended regions
are shock-ionized, some of the assumptions implicit in the shock models may
need to be reconsidered. In addition, we have investigated the nebular
continuum cointribution to the UV excess in the galaxies of our sample. We find
a substantial nebular emission contribution to the UV continuum in all the
cases. However, after the subtraction iof the nebular component, a significant
UV excess remains in the extended nebulae of most of the objects.

s^{-1}$ to 7.6$\times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ in the 3--20 keV band),
as the source settled into the ``off state''. Our spectral analysis revealed
the presence of a prominent iron K$_{\alpha}$ line in the observed spectrum of
the source for all observations. The line shows an interesting evolution: it is
centered at $\sim$6.4 keV when the measured flux is above 5$\times 10^{-11}$
erg cm$^{-2} s^{-1}$, but is shifted to $\sim$6.7 keV at lower fluxes. The
equivalent width of the line appears to increase significantly toward lower
fluxes, although it is likely to be sensitive to calibration uncertainties.
While the fluorescent emission of neutral or mildly ionized iron atoms in the
accretion disk can perhaps account for the 6.4 keV line, as is often invoked
for black hole candidates, it seems difficult to understand the 6.7 keV line
with this mechanism, because the disk should be less ionized at lower fluxes
(unless its density changes drastically). On the other hand, the 6.7 keV line
might be due to recombination cascade of hydrogen or helium like iron ions in
an optically thin, highly ionized plasma. We discuss the results in the context

Bursts that use gamma-ray observations alone. They relate the burst luminosity
(L) with the time lag between peaks in hard and soft energies, and the
spikiness or variability of the burst's light curve (V). These relations are
currently justified and calibrated with only 6 or 7 bursts with known red
shifts. We have examined BATSE data for the lag and V for 112 bursts. (1) A
strong correlation between the lag and V exists, and it is exactly as predicted
from the two proposed relations. This is proof that both luminosity indicators
are reliable. (2) GRB830801 is the all-time brightest burst, yet with a small V
and a large lag, and hence is likely the closest known event being perhaps as
close as 3.2 Mpc. (3) We have combined the luminosities as derived from both
indicators as a means to improve the statistical and systematic accuracy when
compared with the accuracy from either method alone. The result is a list of
112 bursts with good luminosities and hence red shifts. (4) The burst averaged
hardness ratio rises strongly with the luminosity of the burst. (5) The burst
luminosity function is a broken power law, with the break at L = 2x10^{52}
erg/s. The luminosity function has power law indices of -2.8+-0.2 above the
break and -1.7+-0.1 below the break. (6) The number density of GRBs varies with
red shift roughly as (1+z)^(2.5+-0.3) between 0.2<z<5. Excitingly, this result
also provides a measure of the star formation rate out to z~5 with no effects

finding a lag/variability relation for 112 BATSE bursts. Here, I provide simple

consequence of conservation of energy when radiative cooling dominates. High
luminosity bursts cool rapidly so the lag between when hard and soft photons
peak is short, while low luminosity bursts cool slowly so the lag is long. The
variability/luminosity relation arises within internal shock models because the

we are able to obtain the most accurate map of N$_{H_{2}}$ to date for IC 342.
Due to their low opacities, the transitions of C$^{18}$O give a more reliable
estimate of the true molecular gas column density distribution than the more
common $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO isotopomers. The morphology of the C$^{18}$O
emission in the nucleus is a mini-spiral similar to that of the main
isotopomer, $^{12}$CO, except it is more symmetric, lacking the enhancements to
north. We suggest that the asymmetries present in $^{12}$CO images may reflect
the viewing perspective of the starburst region biased by the high optical
depths of $^{12}$CO, rather than true asymmetries in the amount of molecular
gas present. The giant molecular clouds seen in C$^{18}$O appear to be
nonspherical, probably due to tidal arm shearing. Column densities determined
from C$^{18}$O observations, 1.3 mm dust continuum, and the virial theorem
indicate that the standard Galactic conversion factor, X$_{CO}$, overestimates
the amount of molecular gas in the center of IC 342 by a factor of $\sim$2-3 at
the molecular cloud peaks, and by $>$3 in the diffuse gas away from the
starburst. Revised molecular masses based on this conversion factor imply that
star formation efficiencies in the starburst region are very high. From the
distribution of gas and star formation it appears that the sites of star
formation are dynamically determined, rather than driven by density peaks. Near
the central star-forming region, evidence is seen for chemical enrichment of
C$^{18}$O due to massive stars.

that a significant fraction of present-day early-type galaxies was transformed

evolution of early-type galaxies and the low scatter in their color-magnitude
relation indicate a high formation redshift of their stars. In this paper we
construct models which reconcile these apparently contradictory lines of
evidence, and we quantify the effects of morphological evolution on the
observed photometric properties of early-type galaxies in distant clusters. We
show that in the case of strong morphological evolution the apparent luminosity
and color evolution of early-type galaxies are similar to that of a single age
stellar population formed at z=infinity, irrespective of the true star
formation history of the galaxies. Furthermore, the scatter in age, and hence
the scatter in color and luminosity, is approximately constant with redshift.
These results are consequences of the ``progenitor bias'': the progenitors of
the youngest low redshift early-type galaxies drop out of the sample at high
redshift. We construct models which reproduce the observed evolution of the
number fraction of early-type galaxies in rich clusters and their color and
luminosity evolution simultaneously. Our modelling indicates that approx. 50%
of early-type galaxies were transformed from other galaxy types at z<1, and
their progenitor galaxies may have had roughly constant star formation rates
prior to morphological transformation. After correcting the observed evolution
of the mean M/L_B ratio for the maximum progenitor bias we find that the mean

mechanisms. Due to the rather high mass of the star (about $5 \Msol$), the most
probable model is that of dynamical ejection.

reproduce a variety of observational constraints such as the emissivities at
rest-frame 0.44, 25, 60 and 100 $\mu$m of the local universe and also the
overall shape of the extragalactic background light from UV/NIR galaxy counts
and the cosmic infrared background (CIB) from DIRBE/FIRAS measurements. We find
that the CIB at 140 $\mu$m is crucial for discriminating between the CSFR
histories. The best-fit model to this constraint seems to favour mid-infrared
derived CSFR at low-$z$ and a flat CSFR at higher $z$ consistent with the most
recent estimations, although the shape of the CSFR at high redshifts has little
impact on the FIR/submm part of extragalactic background. We suggest that the
bulk of the CIB energy is produced by a population of moderately obscured
normal galaxies lying at $0\le z \le 1$. We then derive the global chemical
enrichment and stellar content of the universe and find that this model
predicts metallicities in good agreement with the metallicity in DLAs given
that some outflow of metal-enriched gas from galaxies is assumed, but it
overproduces the current present-day stellar mass density and NIR luminosity

  ApJ",,"10.1086/320976",,"astro-ph",,"  We have analyzed the full set of SOHO/MDI f- and p-mode oscillation
frequencies from 1996 to date in a search for evidence of solar radius
evolution during the rising phase of the current activity cycle. Like Antia et
al. (2000), we find that a significant fraction of the f-mode frequency changes
scale with frequency; and that if these are interpreted in terms of a radius
change, it implies a shrinking sun. Our inferred rate of shrinkage is about 1.5
km/y, which is somewhat smaller than found by Antia et al. We argue that this
rate does not refer to the surface, but rather to a layer extending roughly
from 4 to 8 Mm beneath the visible surface. The rate of shrinking may be
accounted for by an increasing radial component of the rms random magnetic
field at a rate that depends on its radial distribution. If it were uniform,
the required field would be ~7 kG. However, if it were inwardly increasing,
then a 1 kG field at 8 Mm would suffice.
  To assess contribution to the solar radius change arising above 4Mm, we
analyzed the p-mode data. The evolution of the p-mode frequencies may be
explained by a magnetic^M field growing with activity. The implications of the
near-surface magnetic field changes depend on the anisotropy of the random
magnetic field. If the field change is predominantly radial, then we infer an
additional shrinking at a rate between 1.1-1.3 km/y at the photosphere. If on
the other hand the increase is isotropic, we find a competing expansion at a
rate of 2.3 km/y. In any case, variations in the sun's radius in the activity
cycle are at the level of 10^{-5} or less, hence have a negligible contribution
to the irradiance variations.

seven nearby, early type spiral galaxies, to address the question of whether a
low-luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus (LLAGN) is present in galaxies that have
a LINER 2 classification. The brightest discrete X-ray source in the ROAST HRI
observations is invariably found to be positionally coincident with the optical
galactic nucleus, and in most cases its flux dominates the X-ray emission from
the central region of the galaxy. All seven galaxies have X-ray spectra
consistent with a two-component, soft thermal plus hard power-law, spectral
form. If we exclude the two galaxies with relatively hard X-ray spectra, NGC
3628 and NGC 4594, for which there is supporting evidence for a LLAGN (or
alternatively in the case of NGC 3628 a dominant ultra-luminous X-ray binary),
then the remaining galaxies show surprisingly similar X-ray spectral
properties. Specifically the flux ratio F_x(0.5-1)/F_x(2-5), which measures the
relative strengths of the thermal and non-thermal emission components, shows
little scatter about a mean of 0.66, a value very similar to that measured in
the classic starburst galaxy NGC 253. Since there is no obvious reason why the
luminosity of the hard power-law continuum emanating from a putative LLAGN
should be very closely correlated with the thermal emission of the surrounding
region, this suggests that that the broad-band (0.5-5 keV) X-ray emission from
these LINER 2 galaxies may originate in a common set of processes probably
associated with the starburst phenomenon. Conversely, it appears that in many,
perhaps the majority, of LINER 2 galaxies, the nuclear X-ray luminosity does
not derive directly from the presence of a LLAGN.

equation for the gas, we have performed extensive modelling of circumstellar CO
radio line emission from a large sample of optically bright carbon stars. We
determine some of the basic parameters that characterize circumstellar
envelopes (CSEs), e.g., the stellar mass loss rate, the gas expansion velocity,
and the kinetic temperature structure of the gas.
  The derived mass loss rates span almost four orders of magnitude, from 5E-9
up to 2E-5 solar masses per year, with the median mass loss rate being 3E-7
solar masses per year. We estimate that the estimated mass loss rates are
typically accurate to 50% within the adopted circumstellar model. The physical
conditions prevailing in the CSEs vary considerably over such a large range of
mass loss rates. Among other things, it appears that the dust-to-gas mass ratio
and/or the dust properties change with the mass loss rate. We find that the
mass loss rate and the gas expansion velocity are well correlated, and that
both of them clearly depend on the pulsational period and (with larger scatter)
the stellar luminosity. Moreover, the mass loss rate correlates weakly with the
stellar effective temperature, in the sense that the cooler stars tend to have
higher mass loss rates, but there seems to be no correlation with the stellar
C/O-ratio. We conclude that the mass loss rate increases with increased regular
pulsation and/or luminosity, and that the expansion velocity increases as an
effect of increasing mass loss rate (for low mass loss rates) and luminosity.

find a dynamical phase diagram with frozen (glassy) and melted (ergodic)

aging of the type found in p-spin glasses. Within the approximations used in

case, only one basic algorithm can solve Q in finite time, and all the other

measure the efficiency of a hybrid algorithm, we construct an optimal
deterministic hybrid algorithm and an efficient randomized hybrid algorithm.

expansion gives nontrivial constraints on the Borel amplitude that can be used
to improve the accuracy of the ordinary perturbative expansion of the Borel
amplitude. In particular, we consider the Borel transform of the Adler function
and its expansion around the first infrared renormalon due to the gluon
condensate. Using the next-to-leading order Wilson coefficient of the gluon
condensate operator, we obtain an exact constraint on the Borel amplitude at
the first IR renormalon. We then extrapolate, using judiciously chosen
conformal transformations and Pade approximants, the ordinary perturbative
expansion of the Borel amplitude in such a way that this constraint is
satisfied. This procedure allows us to predict the $O(\alpha_s^4)$ coefficient
of the Adler function, which gives a result consistent with the estimate by
Kataev and Starshenko using a completely different method. We then apply this
improved Borel amplitude to the tau decay width, and obtain the strong coupling

remove this quantity by hand. The static potential of Alvarez and Arvis $V(R)$

worldvolume solitons from abelian to non-abelian setting by considering the
stack of multiple, coincident D-branes and use it as a guideline to construct

here we are interested in the explicit construction of SU(2) Yang-Mills (YM)

gravitational instanton configuration on the probe D4-brane worldvolume, the
energy of the probe branes attains its minimum value and hence enjoys stable
state provided one employs the Tseytlin's non-abelian DBI action for the

coupling constant \lambda>\lambda_{cr} and a fixed ultraviolet cut off \Lambda,
to the analysis of the regularized Wilson's loop-averages. When generalized to
describe the fat (rather than infinitely thin) flux-tubes, the pattern of thus
modified U(N) Gauge String is proved to be consistent with the chain of the
judiciously regularized U(N) Loop equations. In particular, we reveal the
dimensional reduction YM_{D}=>YM_{2}, taking place in the extreme SC limit
\lambda=>\infty, and compare it with the implications of the AdS/CFT
correspondence conjecture. On the other hand, for the loop-averages associated
to the sufficiently large minimal areas, the proposed stringy pattern is
supposed to be in the one infrared universality class (provided the loops are
without zig-zag backtrackings) with the novel implementation of the noncritical
D-dimensional Nambu-Goto string. The peculiarity is due to the nonstandard
\Lambda^{2}-scaling, \Lambda^{2}=O(\sigma_{ph}), of the physical string tension
\sigma_{ph}. Being well-motivated from the viewpoint of the standard YM_{4}
theory with \lambda=>0, this scaling is argued to entail that the considered
modification of the Nambu-Goto system is in the stringy (rather than in the
branched polymer) regime. In sum, the confinement in the continuous D>=3 U(N)
(and, similarly, SU(N)) gauge theory is justified, for the first time, at least
when both N and \lambda are sufficiently large. As a by-product, when continued

forecasting methods in distinguishing between chaotic and random time-series.
Using the explicit random functions, we can give explicit analytical formulas

increment of phase is determined not only by the segment of geometric path
length, but also by the wavelength in that segment. Because these analyses

  equilibrium state in a spin ensemble of linear molecules",,,"QC-MXJ-2001-1","quant-ph",,"  The multiple-quantum operator algebra formalism has been exploited to
construct generally an unsorted quantum search algorithm. The exponential
propagator and its corresponding effective Hamiltonian are constructed
explicitly that describe in quantum mechanics the time evolution of a multi-
particle two-state quantum system from the initial state to the output of the
unsorted quantum search problem. The exponential propagator usually may not be
compatible with the mathematical structure and principle of the search problem
and hence is not a real quantum search network, but it can be further
decomposed into a product of a series of the oracle unitary operations such as
the selective phase-shift operations and the nonselective unitary operations
which can be expressed further as a sequence of elementary building blocks such
as one-qubit quantum gates and the two-qubit diagonal phase gates, resulting in
that the decomposed propagator is compatible with the mathematical structure
and principle of the search problem and thus, becomes a real quantum search
network. The decomposition for the propagator can be achieved with the help of
the operator algebra structure and symmetry of the effective Hamiltonian, and
the properties of the multiple-quantum operator algebra spaces, especially the
characteristic transformation behavior of the multiple-quantum operators under
the z-axis rotations. It has been shown that the computational complexity of
the search algorithm is dependent upon that of the numerical multidimensional
integration and hence it is believed that the search algorithm could solve
efficiently the unsorted search problem. An NMR device is also proposed to
solve efficiently the unsorted search problem in polynomial time.
