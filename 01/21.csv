as to other CMDs available in the literature, and using the Red Clump location,
the reddening, distance and age of the star cluster have been determined. The
cluster has a distance of 3.3 kpc, its radius is about 2.4 pc; the reddening
E(B-V) is 0.08 mag and the age is 6.3 Gyr. By comparison with theoretical
isochrones, a metallicity of [Fe/H]= -0.2 dex has been estimated. We find a
much flatter mass function than what has been found for young clusters. If the
mass function is a power law dN/dm = const.*m**alpha, then we get alpha =
-0.5+-0.3 in the mass range 0.6-1.1 solar masses. This may be seen as a
signature of the highly evolved dynamical state of the cluster.

Om as a free parameter. Since the likelihood is driven by the nonlinear regime,
we ""break"" the power spectrum at k_b=0.2 h/Mpc and fit a power law at k>k_b.
This allows for independent matching of the nonlinear behavior and an unbiased
fit in the linear regime. The analysis assumes Gaussian fluctuations and
errors, and a linear relation between velocity and density. Tests using proper
mock catalogs demonstrate a reduced bias and a better fit. We find for the
Mark3 and SFI data Om_m=0.32+-0.06 and 0.37+-0.09 respectively, with
sigma_8*Om^0.6 = 0.49+-0.06 and 0.63+-0.08, in agreement with constraints from
other data. The quoted 90% errors include cosmic variance. The improvement in
likelihood due to the nonlinear correction is very significant for Mark3 and
moderately so for SFI. When allowing deviations from LCDM, we find an
indication for a wiggle in the power spectrum: an excess near k=0.05 and a
deficiency at k=0.1 (cold flow). This may be related to the wiggle seen in the
power spectrum from redshift surveys and the second peak in the CMB anisotropy.
A chi^2 test applied to modes of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) shows
that the nonlinear procedure improves the goodness of fit and reduces a spatial
gradient of concern in the linear analysis. The PCA allows addressing spatial

and vacancies are formed along the direction y of the driving field, and (b) a
stripe coarsening stage, in which the number of stripes is reduced and their
average width increases. The number of stripes formed at the end of the first
stage is shown to be a function of L_x/L_y^\phi, with \phi ~ 0.2. Thus,
depending on this parameter, the resulting state could be either single or
multi striped. In the second, stripe coarsening stage, the coarsening time is
found to be proportional to L_y, becoming infinitely long in the thermodynamic

mentioned bounds can be found numerically, by using various extremal point

n=2,3,4,... for which the sum converges absolutely. This is equivalent to a
celebrated theorem of Euler. Of the many proofs that have appeared since Euler,
a simple one was discovered only recently by Calabi: the sum is written as a
definite integral over the unit n-cube, then transformed into the volume of a
polytope Pi_n in R^n whose vertices' coordinates are rational multiples of pi.
We review Calabi's proof, and give two further interpretations. First we define
a simple linear operator T on L^2(0,pi/2), and show that T is self-adjoint and
compact, and that Vol(Pi_n) is the trace of T^n. We find that the spectrum of T
is {1/(4k+1) : k in Z}, with each eigenvalue 1/(4k+1) occurring with
multiplicity 1; thus Vol(Pi_n) is the sum of the n-th powers of these
eigenvalues. We also interpret Vol(Pi_n) combinatorially in terms of the number
of alternating permutations of n+1 letters, and if n is even also in terms of
the number of cyclically alternating permutations of n letters. We thus relate
these numbers with S(n) without the intervention of Bernoulli and Euler numbers

  updated",,,,"nlin.AO nlin.CD",,"  We describe a method to model nonlinear dynamical systems using periodic
solutions of delay-differential equations. We show that any finite-time
trajectory of a nonlinear dynamical system can be loaded approximately into the
initial condition of a linear delay-differential system. It is further shown
that the initial condition can be extended to a periodic solution of the
delay-differential system if an appropriate choice of its parameters is made.
As a result, any finite set of trajectories of a nonlinear dynamical system can
be modeled with arbitrarily small error via a set of periodic solutions of a
linear delay-differential equation. These results can be extended to some
non-linear delay differential systems. One application of the method is for
modeling memory and perception.
