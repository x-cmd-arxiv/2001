  tables; table 1 will be available in machine-readable format at the
  electronic ApJ",,"10.1086/320440",,"astro-ph",,"  By cross-correlating the results of two recent large-scale surveys, the
general properties of a well defined sample of semi-regular variable stars have
been determined. ISOGAL mid-infrared photometry and MACHO lightcurves are
assembled for approximately 300 stars in the Baade's Windows of low extinction
towards the Galactic bulge. These stars are mainly giants of late M spectral
type, evolving along the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). They are found to
possess a wide and continuous distribution of pulsation periods and to obey an
approximate log~period -- bolometric magnitude relation or set of such
relations.
  Approximate mass-loss rates in the range of 1e-8 to 5e-7 M_sun per year are
derived from ISOGAL mid-infrared photometry and models of stellar spectra
adjusted for the presence of optically-thin circumstellar silicate dust.
Mass-loss rates depend on luminosity and pulsation period. Some stars lose mass
as rapidly as short-period Miras but do not show Mira-like amplitudes. A period
of 70 days or longer is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for mass
loss to occur.
  For AGB stars in the mass-loss ranges that we observe, the functional
dependence of mass-loss rate on temperature and luminosity is found to be in
agreement with recent theoretical predictions. If we include our mass-loss
rates with a sample of extreme mass-losing AGB stars in the Large Magellanic
Cloud, we get the general result for AGB stars that mass-loss rate is
proportional to luminosity^{2.7}, valid for AGB stars with 10^{-8} to 10^{-4}
M_sun per year (Abridged).

necessary for galaxies, regardless of whether the cosmic geometry is flat,
open, or $\Lambda$-dominated. Furthermore, we show that the number evolution is
small at redshifts of z<1, but large at z>1, and that this conclusion is valid
for all the three cosmological models under consideration. If the universe is
open or $\Lambda$-dominated, the models, which are subject to the constraint of
the conservation of the comoving mass density of galaxies, naturally predict a
population of star-forming galaxies with the redshift distribution peaking at
$z=2\sim3$, which seems to be consistent with the recent findings from
Lyman-break photometric selection techniques. If the cosmological model is
flat, however, the conservation of the comoving mass density is invalid. Hence,
in order to account for the steep slope of B-band number counts at faint
magnitudes in the flat universe, such a star-forming galaxy population has to
be introduced ad hoc into the modelling alongside the merger assumption.

we include the absorption by dust in the neutral interstellar medium (ISM)
using a recent simple prescription, which is consistent with observations of
nearby starburst galaxies. Our model enables us to interpret quantitatively the
observed optical spectra of galaxies in terms of stars, gas, and dust
parameters. We find that the range of ionized-gas properties spanned by nearby
galaxies implies factors of 3.5 and 14 variations in the Halpha and [OII]
luminosities produced per unit star formation rate (SFR). When accounting for
stellar Halpha absorption and absorption by dust in the neutral ISM, the actual
uncertainties in SFR estimates based on the emergent Halpha and [OII]
luminosities are as high as several decades. We derive new estimators of the
SFR, the gas-phase oxygen abundance, and the effective absorption optical depth
of the dust in galaxies. We show that, with the help of other lines such as
[OII], Hbeta, [OIII], [NII], or [SII], the uncertainties in SFR estimates based
on Halpha can be reduced to a factor of only 2-3, even if the Halpha line is

present new near-infrared data on this object taken using the ALFA adaptive
optics system with the MPE 3D integral field spectrometer and the near-infrared
camera Omega-Cass. The stars themselves have K-band spectra which are dominated
by warm dust emission, analagous to class I-II for low mass YSOs, suggesting
that the stars are in a phase where they are still accreting matter. On the
other hand, the ridge of continuum emission between them is rather bluer,
suggestive of extincted and/or scattered stellar light rather than direct dust
emission. The compactness of the CO emission seen toward each star argues for
accretion disks (which can also account for much of the K-band veiling) rather
than a neutral wind. In contrast to other YSOs with CO emission, LkHa225 has no
detectable Br_gamma emission. Additionally there is no H_2 detected on the
northern star, although we do confirm that the strongest H_2 emission is on the
southern star, where we find it is excited primarily by thermal mechanisms. A
second knot of H_2 is observed to its northeast, with a velocity shift of
-75kms and a higher fraction of non-thermal emission. This is discussed with
reference to the H2O maser, the molecular outflow, and [S II] emission observed
between the stars.

calculate the conductance of the system. The vertex corrections to the
conductivity were found with the use of ""ladder"" approximation combined with
the coherent-potential approximation (CPA) that allowed to consider the case of
strong electron scattering. It is shown that the Ward identity is satisfied in
the framework of this approximation that provides the necessary condition for a
conservation of a tunneling current. Based on the known results of ab-initio
calculations of the TMR for ballistic junctions, we assume that exchange split
quasi-free s-like electrons with the density of states being greater for the
majority spin sub-band give the main contribution to the TMR effect. We show
that, due to interfacial inter-band scattering, the TMR can be substantially
reduced even down to zero value. This is related to the fact that delocalized
quasi-free electrons can scatter into the strongly localized d sub-band with
the density of states at the Fermi energy being larger for minority spins
compared to majority spins. It is also shown that spin-flip electron scattering
on the surface magnons within the interface leads to a further decrease of the

are considered. The first example is a calculation of the self-energy shifts of
the spin-3/2 decuplet baryons in nuclear matter, from the chiral effective
Lagrangian coupling octet and decuplet baryon fields. Special attention is paid
to the self-energy of the delta baryon near the saturation density of nuclear
matter. We find contributions to the mass shifts from contact terms in the
effective Lagrangian with coefficients of unknown value. As a second
application, we formulate an effecive field theory with manifest SU(2) chiral
symmetry for the interactions of K and eta mesons with pions at low energy.
SU(3) chiral symmetry is imposed on the effective field theory by a matching
calculation onto three-flavor chiral perturbation theory. The effective
Lagrangian for the pi-K and pi-eta sectors is worked out to order Q^4; the
effective Lagrangian for the K-K sector is worked out to order Q^2 with contact
interactions to order Q^4. As an application of the method, we calculate the KK
s-wave scattering phase shift at leading order and compare with chiral
perturbation theory. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations of the
approach and propose new directions for work where the matching calculation may
be useful.

``quantized cat map''. This is the quantization of a hyperbolic linear map of
the torus. In a previous paper it was observed that there are quantum
symmetries of the quantum map - a commutative group of unitary operators which
commute with the map, which we called ``Hecke operators''. The eigenspaces of
the quantum map thus admit an orthonormal basis consisting of eigenfunctions of
all the Hecke operators, which we call ``Hecke eigenfunctions''.
  In this note we investigate suprema and value distribution of the Hecke
eigenfunctions. For prime values of the inverse Planck constant N for which the
map is diagonalizable modulo N (the ``split primes'' for the map), we show that
the Hecke eigenfunctions are uniformly bounded and their absolute values
(amplitudes) are either constant or have a semi-circle value distribution as N
tends to infinity. Moreover in the latter case different eigenfunctions become
statistically independent. We obtain these results via the Riemann hypothesis
for curves over a finite field (Weil's theorem) and recent results of N. Katz
on exponential sums. For general N we obtain a nontrivial bound on the supremum
norm of these Hecke eigenfunctions.

E_8-level 1 affine Kac-Moody VOA V.
  We analyze the frame stabilizers, both as abstract groups and as subgroups of
the Lie group Aut(V) = E_8(C). Each frame stabilizer is a finite group,
contained in the normalizer of a 2B-pure elementary abelian 2-group in Aut(V).
In particular, we prove that there are exactly five orbits for the action of
Aut(V) on the set of Virasoro frames, settling an open question about V in
Section 5 of [DGH]. The results about the group structure of the frame
stabilizers can be stated purely in terms of modular braided tensor categories.
  Appendices present aspects of the theory of automorphism groups of VOAs. In
particular, there is a result of general interest, on equivariant embeddings of
lattices: embeddings of lattices into unimodular lattices which respect

behavior. We give numerical evidences that the inverse statistics of 2d
turbulent flows is described by a multi-fractal probability distribution, i.e.
the statistics of laminar events is not simply captured by the exponent
$\alpha$ characterizing the spectrum.

complex zeros of the Riemann zeta function are studied. The imaginary part of
the zeros are interpreted as mean-field single-particle energies, and one fills
them up to a Fermi energy $E_F$. The distribution of the total energy is shown
to be non-Gaussian, asymmetric, and independent of $E_F$ in the limit
$E_F\to\infty$. The moments of the limit distribution are computed
analytically. The autocorrelation function, the finite energy corrections, and
a comparison with random matrix theory are also discussed.

s-d electron states of Cs, Fr, Ba II, and Ra II. For the lower states of these
atoms we have also calculated energies, E1 transition amplitudes, and
lifetimes. We have shown that PNC E1 transition amplitudes between s-d states
can be calculated to high accuracy. Contrary to the Cs 6s-7s transition, in
these transitions there are no strong cancelations between different terms in
the sum-over-states approach. In fact, there is one dominating term which
deviates from the sum by less than 20%. This term corresponds to an s-p_{1/2}
weak matrix element, which can be calculated to better than 1%, and a
p_{1/2}-d_{3/2} E1 transition amplitude, which can be measured. Also, the s-d
amplitudes are about four times larger than the corresponding s-s transitions.
We have shown that by using a hybrid mixed-states/sum-over-states approach the
accuracy of the calculations of PNC s-d amplitudes could compete with that of
Cs 6s-7s if p_{1/2}-d_{3/2} E1 amplitudes are measured to high accuracy.

  Quantum Measurement","8 pages RevTex, 7 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We consider the process of a single-spin measurement using magnetic resonance
force microscopy (MRFM) as an example of a truly continuous measurement in
quantum mechanics. This technique is also important for different applications,
including a measurement of a qubit state in quantum computation. The
measurement takes place through the interaction of a single spin with a
quasi-classical cantilever, modeled by a quantum oscillator in a coherent state
in a quasi-classical region of parameters. The entire system is treated
rigorously within the framework of the Schr\""odinger equation, without any
artificial assumptions. Computer simulations of the spin-cantilever dynamics,
where the spin is continuously rotated by means of cyclic adiabatic inversion,
show that the cantilever evolves into a Schr\""odinger-cat state: the
probability distribution for the cantilever position develops two asymmetric
peaks that quasi-periodically appear and vanish. For a many-spin system our
equations reduce to the classical equations of motion, and we accurately
describe conventional MRFM experiments involving cyclic adiabatic inversion of
the spin system. We surmise that the interaction of the cantilever with the
environment would lead to a collapse of the wave function; however, we show
that in such a case the spin does not jump into a spin eigenstate.
