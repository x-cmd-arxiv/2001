spanning two orbits of the binary, with single epoch coverage extending to
\~9000A. The optical spectrum approximates a steep blue power-law, consistent
with emission on the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of a hot black body spectrum. The
strongest spectral lines are HeII 4686A and CIII/NIII 4640A (Bowen blend) in
emission. Their relative strengths suggest that XTE J2123-058 was formed in the
Galactic plane, not in the halo. Other weak emission lines of HeII and CIV are
present and Balmer lines show a complex structure, blended with HeII. HeII
4686A profiles show a complex multiple S-wave structure with the strongest
component appearing at low velocities in the lower-left quadrant of a Doppler
tomogram. H alpha shows transient absorption between phases 0.35-0.55. Both of
these effects appear to be analogous to similar behaviour in SW Sex type
cataclysmic variables. We therefore consider whether the spectral line
behaviour of XTE J2123-058 can be explained by the same models invoked for
those systems.

from the Be star X Per. The X-Ray spectrum, unusual when compared to brighter

typical of the new class of persistent low luminosity Be/X-Ray binary pulsars.
We attempted spectral fits with continuum models used historically for 4U

oscillation modes as proposed by Samadi et al. (2000) in a companion paper.
This formulation allows to investigate several assumptions concerning
properties of the stellar turbulence. We find that the entropy source plays a
dominant role in the stochastic excitation compared with the Reynold stress
source in agreement with Goldreich et al. (1994). We consider several turbulent
kinetic energy spectra suggested by different observations of the solar
granulation. Differences between turbulent spectra manifest themselves by large
differences in the computed oscillation powers at high oscillation frequency.
Two free parameters which are introduced in the description of the turbulence
enter the expression for the acoustic power. These parameters are adjusted in
order to fit to the solar observations of the surface velocity oscillations.
The best fit is obtained with the kinetic energy spectrum deduced from the
observations of the solar granulation by Nesis et al. (1993); the corresponding
adjusted parameters are found to be compatible with the theoretical upper limit
which can be set on these parameters. The adopted theoretical approach improves
the agreement between solar seismic observations and numerical results.

approximately four orders of magnitude in galaxy density. To create a truly
useful catalog, we have collected optical spectra for nearly all of the

discriminate between those radio galaxies seen in projection on the cluster and
those which are in actuality cluster members. The resulting catalog consists of
329 cluster radio galaxies plus 138 galaxies deemed foreground/background

the identification of active galaxies, as it is dominated by star-forming
galaxies at intermediate luminosities and active galactic nuclei (AGN) at
higher luminosities. The flux limit of the NVSS allows us to identify AGN and
star- forming galaxies down to star formation rates (SFR) less than 1 solar
mass per year. This sensitivity, coupled with the all-sky nature of the NVSS,
allows us to produce a catalog of considerable depth and breadth. In addition
to these data, we report detected infrared fluxes and upper limits obtained
from IRAS data. It is hoped that this database will prove useful in a number of

plane that has unusual properties. It is quite well defined, about 150 pc in
diameter at a distance of 5 kpc, and contains as much as 100,000 Solar Masses
of atomic hydrogen. The outer parts of the cloud appear in HI emission above
the HI background, while the central regions show HI self-absorption. Models
which reproduce the observations have a core with a temperature <40 K and an
outer envelope as much as an order of magnitude hotter. The cold core is
elongated along the Galactic plane, whereas the overall outline of the cloud is
approximately spherical. The warm and cold parts of the HI cloud have a
similar, and relatively large, line width of approximately 7 km/s. The cloud
core is a source of weak, anomalously-excited 1720 MHz OH emission, also with a
relatively large line width, which delineates the region of HI self-absorption
but is slightly blue-shifted in velocity. The intensity of the 1720 MHz OH
emission is correlated with N(H) derived from models of the cold core. There is
12CO emission associated with the cloud core. Most of the cloud mass is in
molecules, and the total mass is > 200,000 Solar Masses. In the cold core the
HI mass fraction may be 10 percent. The cloud has only a few sites of current
star formation. There may be about 100 more objects like this in the inner

in clouds decays rapidly, thus providing a significant source of energy input,
particularly if driven at small scales by, for example, bipolar outflows. We
quantify the heating rates by combining the linewidth-size relations, which
describe global cloud properties, with numerically determined dissipation
rates. We argue that, if cloud turbulence is driven on small internal scales,
the $^{12}$CO flux (enhanced by emission from weakly supersonic shocks) will be
much larger than observed; this, in turn, would imply excitation temperatures
significantly above observed values. We reach two conclusions: (1) small-scale
driving by bipolar outflows cannot possibly account for cloud support and yield
long-lived clouds, unless the published MHD dissipation rates are seriously
overestimated; (2) driving on large scales (comparable to the cloud size) is
much more viable from an energetic standpoint, and if the actual net
dissipation rate is only slightly lower than what current MHD simulations
estimate, then the observationally inferred lifetimes and apparent virial
equilibrium of molecular clouds can be explained.

the 1993 HST campaign of NGC5548 in our previous paper. The model Balmer
continuum's strength and variability characteristics are in agreement with

wavelength dependent lag across the UV-optical spectrum which can broadly mimic
the signature from X-ray reprocessing in an accretion disk, calling into
question the discovery claims of the latter in NGC7469. The influence of the
diffuse continuum on the optical continuum may result in a small yet
significant underestimation of the characteristic sizes of the regions emitting
the optical emission lines. Its contribution can also alter the inferred
spectral energy distribution of the UV-optical continuum, even well outside the
spectral region near the well-known Balmer jump. The reverberation of the
diffuse continuum emitted by the BLR may account for perhaps one-third of the
observed effect that the 1350-5100 Angstrom continuum becomes bluer as it

The stability and the rate of mass transfer then depend on the tidal coupling
between the accretor and the orbital motion. In the second model the formation
of AM CVn stars may be prevented by detonation of the CO white dwarf accretor
and the disruption of the system. With the most favourable conditions for the
formation of AM CVn stars we find a current Galactic birth rate of 6.8 10^{-3}
yr^{-1}. Unfavourable conditions give 1.1 10^{-3} yr^{-1}. The expected total
number of the systems in the Galaxy is 9.4 10^{7} and 1.6 10^{7}, respectively.
We model very simple selection effects to get some idea about the currently
expected observable population and discuss the (quite good) agreement with the
observed systems.

The total sample of LMC targets is analysed in comparison with circumstellar
masers in the Galactic Centre. The photon fluxes of circumstellar masers in the
LMC are very similar to those in the Galactic Centre. The expansion velocities
in the LMC appear to be 20% lower than for similarly bright OH masers in the
Galactic Centre, but the data are consistent with no difference in expansion
velocity. OH/IR stars in the LMC appear to have slower accelerating envelopes
than OH/IR stars in the Galactic Centre. Masers in the LMC have blue-asymmetric
emission profiles. This may be due to the amplification of stellar and/or
free-free radiation, rather than the amplification of dust emission, and may be
more pronounced in low metallicity envelopes. SiO maser strength increases with
the photometric amplitude at 2.2 micron but is independent of the photometric
amplitude at 10 micron. This suggests a strong connection between shocks in the
dust-free SiO masing zone and the dust formation process. Appendices describe

electron energy loss data to be used for estimating losses in photoemission.
The derivation builds on new results for dielectric response and mean free
paths of strongly correlated systems of two dimensional layers. Numerical
evaluations are made for $Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8}$ (Bi2212) by using a
parametrized loss function. The mean free path for Bi2212 is calculated and
found to be substantially larger than obtained by Norman et al in a recent
paper. The photocurrent is expressed as the convolution of the intrinsic
approximation for the current from a specific 2D layer with an effective loss
function. The observed current is the sum of such currents from the first few
layers. The photo electron from a specific $CuO$ layer is found to excite low
energy acoustic plasmon modes due to the coupling between the $CuO$ layers.
These modes give rise to an asymmetric power law broadening of the photo
current an isolated two dimensional layer would have given. We define an
asymmetry index where a contribution from a Luttinger lineshape is additive to
the contribution from our broadening function. Already the loss effect
considered here gives broadening comparable to what is observed experimentally.
A superconductor with a gapped loss function is predicted to have a
peak-dip-hump lineshape similar to what has been observed, and with the same
qualitative behavior as predicted in the recent work by Campuzano et al.

interaction scales with the temperature T as T^{-1/4} |log T|^{-1} in the
semi-classical limit. Using this scheme we find that the effective mass in the
semi-classical limit for composite fermions in GaAs is approximately 6 times
the bare mass.

covariantly in bi-metric spacetime, without the uncertainties which arise from
the effects of gravitational energy-momentum pseudo-tensors. However the effect
that the Strong Principle of Equivalence (SPOE) has on the curved and flat
bi-metric spacetime tetrad structure has not been fully explored. In the
context of bi-metric General Relativity the (SPOE) requires that: a) in the
absence of gravitation due to spacetime curvature a Global Inertial Cartesian
Minkowski (GICM) spacetime frame exists in which Special Relativity is valid
and, b) in the presence of gravitation due to spacetime curvature a bi-metric
Local Free Fall frame (LFF) must always exist. These two conditions required by
the (SPOE) are then shown to imply that a symmetric gravitational potential
tensor must exist in the bi-metric spacetime which is connected exponentially
to the tetrad inner product between the curved symmetric tetrads and the flat
background symmetric tetrads. It is then shown that this (SPOE) generated
gravitational potential tensor has the property of exponentially connecting the
curved metric tensor with the flat background metric tensor in a manner which
allows the condition of ""Light Cone Causality"" (LCC) to be dynamically
satisfied in the bi-metric spacetime. Substitution of this (LCC) conserving
exponential metric into the bi-metric Einstein field equations, subject to an
appropriate choice of tensor gauge conditions, yields an equivalent set of
(LCC) conserving bi-metric Einstein field equations for the gravitational
potential tensor, the full implications of which will be explored in future
papers.

$H$, formulated in the Coulomb gauge. As in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model,
chiral symmetry is explicity broken, however our approach is renormalizable and
also includes confinement through a linear potential with slope specified by
lattice gauge theory. This interaction generates an infrared integrable
singularity and we detail the computationally intensive procedure necessary for
numerical solution. We focus upon applications for the $u, d, s$ and $c$ quark
flavors and compute the mass spectrum for the pseudoscalar, scalar and vector
mesons. We also perform a comparative study of alternative many-body techniques
for approximately diagonalizing $H$: BCS for the vacuum ground state; TDA and
RPA for the excited hadron states. The Dirac structure of the field theoretical
Hamiltonian naturally generates spin-dependent interactions, including tensor,
spin-orbit and hyperfine, and we clarify the degree of level splitting due to
both spin and chiral symmetry effects. Significantly, we find that roughly
two-thirds of the $\pi$-$\rho$ mass difference is due to chiral symmetry and
that only the RPA preserves chiral symmetry. We also document how hadronic mass
scales are generated by chiral symmetry breaking in the model vacuum. In
addition to the vacuum condensates, we compute meson decay constants and detail
the Nambu-Goldstone realization of chiral symmetry by numerically verifying the
Gell-Mann-Oaks-Renner relation. Finally, by including D waves in our charmonium
calculation we have resolved the anomalous overpopulation of $J/\Psi$ states
relative to observation.

shadowing phenomenon between whole supermultiplets of fields. In particular,
there are strong suggestions about the consistency of a massive truncation of
11D supergravity to the massless modes of the graviton supermultiplet plus the
massive modes of its shadow partner. This fact has important consequences in
the ${\cal N}=2$ and ${\cal N}=3$ cases, which seem to realize respectively a

for every irreducible complex K\""ahler manifold $X$ of dimension $2n$, there

a_{2k}/(2k)! q_X(c_1(L))^k$ for the Euler characteristic of a line bundle $L$,
where $q_X: H^2(X, \mathbbm C) \to \mathbbm C$ is the Beauville-Bogomolov
quadratic form of $X$.
  Using Rozansky-Witten classes similar to Hitchin and Sawon, we obtain a
formula expressing the $a_{2k}$ in terms of Chern numbers of $X$. Furthermore,
for the $n$-th generalized Kummer variety $\KA n$, we prove $\chi(L) = (n + 1)
\binom{q(c_1(L)) / 2 + n} n$ by purely algebro-geometric methods, where $q$ is
the form $q_X$ up to a positive rational constant. A similar formula is already
known for the Hilbert scheme of zero-dimensional subschemes of length $n$ on a
K3-surface.
  Using our results, we are able to calculate all Chern numbers of the
generalized Kummer varieties $\KA n$ for $n \leq 5$. For $n \leq 4$ these
results were previously obtained by Sawon.

the Friedberg-Lee model containing the constituent quark and the scalar meson.
  An appropriate way of quantization for the non-linear meson field is employed
by taking account of the non-topological soliton existed in the classical
level.
  Our model space for the nucleon resonances includes the three-quark plus
one-meson state in addition to the pure three-quark state.
  The excitation spectrum in this model space shows that the positive parity
state appears as the first excited state associated with the 0s-excitation of
the scalar meson.
  The meson excitation also generates the additional negative parity state
apart from the well-known 0p-excitation of the quark.

time-dependent perturbation to substitute the exact solution. From the point of
mathematics, it may be correct only in the convergent region of the
time-dependent perturbation series. Where is the convergent region of this
series? Quantum mechanics did not answer this problem. However it is relative
to the question, can we use the Schrodinger equation to describe the transition
processes? So it is the most important unsettling problem of physical theory.
We find out the time-dependent approximate solution for arbitrary and the exact
solution. Then we can prove that: (1) In the neighborhood of the conservation
of energy, the series is divergent. The basic error of quantum mechanics is
using the sum of the first finite orders approximate solutions to substitute
the exact solution in this divergent region. It leads to an infinite error. So
the Fermi golden rule is not a mathematically reasonable inference of the.
Schrodinger equation (2) The transiton probability per unit time deduced from

errors due to its geometric property, is made by NMR technique recently under
adiabatic condition. By the adiabatic requirement, the result is inexact unless
the Hamiltonian changes extremely slowly in the process. However, in quantum
computation, everything has to be completed within the decoherence time. High
running speed of every gate in quantum computation is demanded because the
power of quantum computer can be exponentially proportional to the maximum
number of logic gate operation that can be taken sequentially within the
decoherence time. Adiabatic condition makes any fast conditional Berry
phase(cyclic adiabatic geometric phase) shift gate impossible. Here we show
that by using a new designed sequence of simple operations with an additional
vertical magnetic field, the conditional geometric phase shift can be done
non-adiabatically. Therefore geometric quantum computation can be done in the
same speed level of usual quantum computation.

estimate relevant time scales that match the results of numerical simulations
of the master-equation. This opens new possibilities both in the study of
quantum effects in non-equilibrium phase transitions and in general
time-dependent problems where quantum effects may be relevant even after
