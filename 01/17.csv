the Milky Way and other galaxies has focused on the equilibrium of its luminous
disk. However, the interplay between all components, seen and unseen, is a
major cause of observed features and drives evolution. I will review the key
underlying dynamics, and in a number of examples, show how this leads to
lopsidedness and offset nuclei, may trigger bars and cause warps. Indeed, the
Milky Way like most spiral galaxies show exhibit many of these features. In
addition, the mechanisms suggest that observed morphology depends on the
properties of the galaxy and only weakly on any particular disturbance. Because
of this convergence, understanding a galaxy's history will be subtle and
require the level of detail that study of the Milky Way can provide.

unconstrained. In particular, little is known about how, and if, remnants of
mergers generate hot gas halos. Here we examine the relationship between X-ray
luminosity and galaxy age for a sample of early-type galaxies. Comparing
normalized X-ray luminosity to three different age indicators we find that
L_X/L_B increases with age, suggesting an increase in X-ray halo mass with time
after a galaxy's last major star-formation episode. The long-term nature of
this trend, which appears to continue across the full age range of our sample,
poses a challenge for many models of hot halo formation. We conclude that
models involving a declining rate of type Ia supernovae, and a transition from
outflow to inflow of the gas originally lost by galactic stars, offers the most
promising explanation for the observed evolution in X-ray luminosity.

Massive stars form at the densest regions of the molecular cloud complex. The
winds and outflows associated with these stars have a disrupting effect on the
complex and inject mechanical energy into the parent clouds, while the UV
radiation from the young stars also heat the parent clouds. The present set of
data suggests, however, that massive stars alone may not account for the
energetics of the clouds in the Carina region. The details of the data and the
correlation among the various data sets hint at the possible role that the
spiral density wave shock plays in feeding interstellar turbulence and in

Because of this combination of Sedov-type (thermal emission) and non-Sedov type

to the difficulties in modeling accurately all the physical conditions which

data from the ASCA and ROSAT satellites coupled with previous results at other
wavelengths. We find that the X-ray emission from G272.2-3.2 is best described
by a non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) model with a temperature around 0.70 keV,
an ionization timescale of 3200 cm^-3 yr and a relatively high column density

spectroscopy in the K-band of 6 to 10 of the brightest giants in a cluster. Our
calibration is derived from spectra of 105 stars in 15 globular clusters. From
measurements of the equivalent widths of three features in these spectra, Na,
Ca, and CO, we are able to reproduce the Zinn & West (1984) abundance scale as
updated by Harris (1996) to better than 0.10 dex for clusters with near solar
[Fe/H] down to an [Fe/H] of -1.8. Three advantages of this method are that it
can be used for metal rich, heavily reddened globulars in crowded fields, it
does not require any knowledge of any other cluster or stellar parameters such
as reddening, distance, or luminosity, and it requires only minimal telescope
time. If stellar (J-K)0 and MK values are available as well, the accuracy of
the [Fe/H] estimate is further improved. Observations of as few as three stars
per cluster still gives an [Fe/H] estimate wich is nearly as reliable as that
based on two to three times as many stars.
  The accuracy of an [Fe/H] value based on observations of CO absorption alone
is significantly less than that which results from the three spectroscopic
indices. However, we predict that space-based observations of this feature in
the integrated light of stellar systems will prove to be of great value for
abundance determinations at distances as far as the Coma cluster of galaxies.

dM/dt is strongly time varying and influenced by the mutual interaction of
protostellar cores and their competition for accretion from the common cluster
gas reservoir. Even for protostars with similar final mass, the accretion
histories may differ dramatically. High-mass stars build up in the central
parts of dense, cluster-forming cloud regions. They begin to form in the early
phases of cluster evolution, and continue to grow at a high rate until the
available gas is exhausted or expelled by feedback. Lower-mass stars tend to
form at later phases, and dM/dt declines rapidly after a short initial phase of

arbitrary small value in classes of scalar tensor theories. The trouble with
such schemes is that effective gravity itself vanishes. We explore the
possibility of avoiding this ``no-go'' with a spatially varying effective
gravity. We demonstrate this in principle with the non-minimally coupled scalar
field having an additional coupling to a fermionic field. The expectation value
of the scalar field gets anchored to a non-trivial value inside compact
domains. But for the non-minimal coupling to the scalar curvature, these
configurations are analogous to the non-topological solutions suggested by Lee
and Wick. With non-minimal coupling, this leads to a peculiar spatial variation
of effective gravity. As before, one can dynamically have the long distance
(global) gravitational constant $G$ and ${\Lambda}$, the cosmological constant,
tending to zero. However, inside compact domains, $G$ can be held to a
universal (non-vanishing) value. Long distance gravitational effects turn out
to be indistinguishable from those expected of general theory of relativity
(GTR). There are two ways in which the ensuing theory may lead to a viable
effective gravity theory: (a) the compact domains could be of microscopic
(sub-nuclear) size, or (b) the domains could be large enough to accommodate
structures as large as a typical galaxy. Aspects of effective gravity and
cosmology that follow are described. A toy Freidman - Robertson - Walker (FRW)
model free from several standard model pathologies and characteristic features
emerges.

thin thermal emission with nearly cosmic abundances indicate that 3C 400.2

one single burst is able to enrich chemically the surrounding region in few

due to an incorrect choice of the initial galaxy model configurations, these
have been chosen to be tidally-limited King spheres, representing systems in
quasi-equilibrium within the tidal field of the halo. The potential of the halo
has been assumed to be frozen and the braking due to dynamical friction
neglected. Our results confirm the hypothesis of low rates of tidal stripping
and suggest a scenario for virialized Compact Group evolution in their
quiescent phases with only very moderate tidally induced galaxy evolution can
be generally expected. This implies the group stability, provided that the
dynamical friction timescales in these systems are not much shorter than the
Hubble time. We discuss briefly this possibility, in particular taking account
of the similarity between the velocity dispersions of a typical virialized
Compact Groups and the internal velocity dispersion of typical member galaxies.
A number of puzzling observational data on Compact Groups can be easily
explained in this framework. Other observations would be better understood as
the result of enhanced merging activity in the proto-group environment, leading
to virialized Compact Group formation through mergers of lower mass halos, as

is explored numerically using a global 2d model of the inner region of a

In agreement with the theory a spiral instability, similar in many ways to
those observed in self-gravitating disks, develops when the magnetic field is,
within a factor of a few, at equipartition with the disk thermal pressure.
Perturbations in the flow build up currents and create a perturbed magnetic
field within the disk. The present non-linear simulations give good evidence
that such an instability can occur in the inner region of accretion disks, and
generate accretion of gas and vertical magnetic flux toward the central object,
if the equilibrium radial profiles of density and magnetic flux exceed a

a `beta' velocity law, $v(r)=v_{\infty} (1-\R_{\ast}/r)^\beta$. Above some
initial onset radius $R_o$ for X-ray emission, the radial variation of the
emission filling factor is assumed to decline as a power-law in radius, $f(r)
\sim r^{-q}$. The computed emission profiles also account for continuum
absorption within the wind, with the overall strength characterized by a
cumulative optical depth $\tau_\ast$. In terms of a wavelength shift from

based on harmonic expansions and scale linearly with the number of bodies,
similar to Fourier transform solutions used in cosmological simulations.
Although fast, until recently they were only efficiently used for small number
of geometries and background profiles. These same techniques may be used to
study the modes and response of a galaxy to an arbitrary perturbation. In
particular, I will describe the modal spectra of stellar systems and role of
damped modes which are generic to stellar systems in interactions and appear to
play a significant role in determining the common structures that we see. The

and a solvent parameter which is related to the pH of the solution. It exhibits
a native state in which the chain coalesces into a unique compact conformation
as well as a denatured state. Under certain solvation conditions, both warm and
cold denaturations occur between the native and the denatured states. A good
agreement is found with the data obtained from calorimetric experiments,

studied theoretically in the case when spin-orbit interaction plays a

when the spin-orbit interaction results from reduced dimensionality of the
system and is of the Bychkov-Rashba type. Results of the analysis show that the
localization corrections to conductivity of ferromagnetic metals lead to a
negative magnetoresistance -- also in the presence of the spin-orbit

nonmagnetic systems, does not occur in ferromagnetic systems. In the case of

of atoms in a logic program P. This bound is achieved by an algorithm
introduced by Van Gelder and known as the alternating-fixpoint algorithm.
Improving on the alternating-fixpoint algorithm turned out to be difficult. In
this paper we study extensions and modifications of the alternating-fixpoint
approach. We then restrict our attention to the class of programs whose rules
have no more than one positive occurrence of an atom in their bodies. For
programs in that class we propose a new implementation of the
alternating-fixpoint method in which false atoms are computed in a top-down

that for a wide class of programs it is linear and so, asymptotically optimal.

consequence is that critical phenomena will be observed in the collapse of

apply discrete wavelets in their practice. The notion of wavelets and their use
in practical computing and various applications are briefly described, but
rigorous proofs of mathematical statements are omitted, and the reader is just
referred to corresponding literature. The multiresolution analysis and fast
wavelet transform became a standard procedure for dealing with discrete
wavelets. The proper choice of a wavelet and use of nonstandard matrix
multiplication are often crucial for achievement of a goal. Analysis of various
functions with the help of wavelets allows to reveal fractal structures,
singularities etc. Wavelet transform of operator expressions helps solve some
equations. In practical applications one deals often with the discretized
functions, and the problem of stability of wavelet transform and corresponding
numerical algorithms becomes important. After discussing all these topics we

mechanical waves transmitted through DNA. The propagation of the waves is
strongly dependent on the shape of the DNA thus proteins that change the shape
of DNA can alter signal transmission. The overall effect is a method of signal
processing by DNA binding proteins that creates a ""cellular communications

  The propagation of small amplitude disturbances through DNA is treated
according to the mechanical theory of elastic rods. According to the theory
four types of mechanical waves affecting extension(compression), twist, bend or
shear can propagate through DNA. Each type of wave has unique characteristic
properties. Disturbances affecting all wave types can propagate independently
of each other. Using a linear approximation to the theory of motion of elastic
rods, the dispersion of these waves is investigated. The phase velocities of
the waves lies in the range 5-8 angstroms/ps using constants suitable for a
description of DNA. The dispersion of all wave types of arbitrary wave length
is investigated for a straight, twisted rod.
  Based on these findings, we propose all-atom numerical simulations of DNA to
investigate the propagation of these waves as an alternative measure of the
wave velocity and dispersion analysis.

convergence. Inclusion of first-order spin-orbit coupling is essential for
accurate ionization potentials and electron affinities involving degenerate

ionization potentials than for electron affinities, while scalar relativistic

(2000), where results for $N\leq 9$ were presented. The extension up to N=16 is
possible when one defines for each N a specially chosen set of observables. We
also present results concerning the critical detectors efficiency beyond which
a valid test of local realism for entangled quNits is possible.
