stellar bulge component in three galaxies of the Fornax cluster observed with
the WFPC2 of the HST. A careful comparative analysis of these distributions
confirms that stars are more concentrated toward the galactic centres than
globular clusters, in agreement with what was observed in many other galaxies.
If the observed difference is the result of evolution of the globular cluster
system sstarting from initial profiles similar to those of the halo--bulge
stellar components, a relevant fraction of their mass (74%, 47%, 52% for NGC
1379, NGC 1399 and NGC 1404, respectively) is disappeared in the inner regions,
likely contributing to the nuclear field population, local dynamics and high
energy phenomena in the primeval life of the galaxy. An indication in favour of
the evolutionary interpretation of the difference between the globular cluster
system and stellar bulge radial profiles is given by the positive correlation
we found between the value of the mass lost from the GCS and the central
galactic black hole mass in the set of seven galaxies for which these data are
available.

through their influence on oscillating neutrinos. Two different cases of lepton
asymmetry are discussed: an initially present and a dynamically generated in
oscillations. Dynamically generated in resonant oscillations asymmetry at small
mixing angles suppresses oscillations, hence, the nucleosynthesis bounds on
neutrino mass differences at small mixings are relaxed. Initially present
asymmetry may suppress or enhance oscillations. The enhancement is a result of
interchanging resonances between neutrino and antineutrino ensembles due to
resonance waves passing through the neutrino and antineutrino spectrum. Updated

absorption by the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC), ten stars show absorption by
an additional cloud, which we name the Hyades Cloud, and one star exhibits a
third absorption component. The LIC absorption is observed at a lower radial
velocity than predicted by the LIC velocity vector derived by Lallement &
Bertin (1992) and Lallement et al. (1995), (v(predicted LIC) - v(observed LIC)

of the superconducting order parameter is shown to occur when the kinematic
momentum (or supervelocity) of the condensate reaches a threshold value at the
superconductor edge or surface. Due to this instability, vortices start to
nucleate at the edge or surface and then penetrate deeper into the sample. It
is found that the presence of surface defects causes a noticeable drop of the
first penetration field and leads to a qualitative change of the magnetization
curve. Based on these results a simple phenomenological model of the edge or

suggested.

Boyer-Lindquist radius $r = M$, the coordinate of the hole's event horizon.
These ``horizon skimming'' orbits have the property that their angular momentum
$L_z$ {\it increases} with inclination angle, opposite to the familiar behavior
one encounters at larger radius. In this paper, I show that this behavior is
characteristic of a larger family of orbits, the ``nearly horizon skimming''
(NHS) orbits. NHS orbits exist in the very strong field of any black hole with
spin $a\agt 0.952412M$. Their unusual behavior is due to the locking of
particle motion near the event horizon to the hole's spin, and is therefore a
signature of the Kerr metric's extreme strong field. An observational hallmark
of NHS orbits is that a small body spiraling into a Kerr black hole due to
gravitational-wave emission will be driven into orbits of progressively smaller
inclination angle, toward the equator. This is in contrast to the ``normal''
behavior. For circular orbits, the change in inclination is very small, and
unlikely to be of observational importance. I argue that the change in
inclination may be considerably larger when one considers the evolution of
inclined eccentric orbits. If this proves correct, then the gravitational waves
produced by evolution through the NHS regime may constitute a very interesting
and important probe of the strong-field nature of rotating black holes.

theory, after a conformal transformation to the Einstein frame, we numerically
obtain static solutions, each of which consists of a positive tension brane and
a negative tension brane. For these solutions, we obtain two relations between
the warp factor and the brane tensions. The existence of these relations
implies that, contrary to the original Randall-Sundrum model, the so called
radion is no longer a zero mode. We conclude that the tension of our brane
should be negative and that fine-tuning of the tension of both branes is
necessary for a large warp factor to explain the large hierarchy between the

potentials acting between quarks. For the scalar- and vector-meson exchanges,
the momentum-dependent higher-order term is incorporated to reduce the
attractive effect of the central interaction at higher energies. The
single-particle potentials of the nucleon and Lambda, predicted by the G-matrix
calculation, now have proper repulsive behavior in the momentum region q_1=5 -
20 fm^-1. A moderate contribution of the spin-orbit interaction from the
scalar-meson exchange is also included. As to the vector mesons, a dominant
contribution is the quadratic spin-orbit force generated from the rho-meson
exchange. The nucleon-nucleon phase shifts at the non-relativistic energies up
to T_lab=350 MeV are greatly improved especially for the 3E states. The
low-energy observables of the nucleon-nucleon and the hyperon-nucleon
interactions are also reexamined. The isospin symmetry breaking and the Coulomb
effect are properly incorporated in the particle basis. The essential feature
of the Lambda N - Sigma N coupling is qualitatively similar to that obtained
from the previous models. The nuclear saturation properties and the
single-particle potentials of the nucleon, Lambda and Sigma are reexamined
through the G-matrix calculation. The single-particle potential of the Sigma
hyperon is weakly repulsive in symmetric nuclear matter. The single-particle
spin-orbit strength for the Lambda particle is very small, in comparison with
that of the nucleons, due to the strong antisymmetric spin-orbit force
generated from the Fermi-Breit interaction.

HF-induced in the ionosphere F region may cause significant attenuation of both

demonstrate existence and strength of this effect, direct measurements of
attenuation of both powerful pump wave and weak probing waves of extraordinary
polarization have been carried out during an experimental campaign on September
6, 7 and 9, 1999 at the Sura heating facility. The attenuation magnitude of
extraordinary waves reaches of 1-10 dB over a background attenuation caused by
natural irregularities. It is interpreted in the paper on the base of the
theory of multiple scattering from the artificial random irregularities with
characteristic scale lengths of 0.1-1 km. Simple procedure for determining of
irregularity spectrum parameters from the measured attenuation of extraordinary

  Cloud in Magnetosphere","Presented at COSPAR 2000",,"10.1016/S0273-1177(02)00187-4",,"physics.space-ph",,"  An analysis of the Alfven wave generation associated with the barium vapor
release at altitudes ~ 5.2 Earth's radii (ER) in the magnetosphere is
presented. Such injections were executed in G-8 and G-10 experiments of the
Combined Radiation and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) mission. It is shown
that the generation of Alfven waves is possible during the total time of plasma
expansion. The maximum intensity of these waves corresponds to the time of
complete retardation of the diamagnetic cavity created by the expansion of
plasma cloud. The Alfven wave exhibits a form of an impulse with an effective
frequency ~ 0.03-0.05 Hz. Due to the background conditions and wave frequency,
the wave mainly oscillates along the geomagnetic field between the mirror
reflection points situated at ~ 0.7 ER. The wave amplitude is sufficient to the
generation of plasma instabilities and longitudinal electric field, and to an
increase in the longitudinal energy of electrons to ~ 1 keV. These processes
are the most probable for altitudes ~ 1 ER. The auroral kilometric radiation
(AKR) at frequencies ~ 100 kHz is associated with these accelerated electrons.
The acceleration of electrons and AKR can be observed almost continuously
during the first minute and then from time to time with pauses about 35-40 s
till 6-8 min after the release. The betatron acceleration of electrons at the
recovery of the geomagnetic field is also discussed. This mechanism could be
responsible for the acceleration of electrons resulting in the aurorae and
ultra short radio wave storm at frequencies 50-300 MHz observed at the 8-10th
min after the release.

and local interactions on the intermittency corrections in the scaling
properties of 3D turbulence. We show that neglect of local interactions leads
to an enhanced small-scale energy spectrum and to a significantly larger number
of very intense vortices (tornadoes) and stronger intermittency. On the other
hand, neglect of the non-local interactions results in even stronger
small-scale spectrum but significantly weaker intermittency. Based on these
observations, a new model of turbulence is proposed, in which non-local
(RDT-like) interactions couple large and small scale via a multiplicative
process with additive noise and the local interactions are modeled by a
turbulent viscosity. This model is used to derive a simple toy version of the
Langevin equations for small-scale velocity increments. A Gaussian
approximation for the large scale fields yields the Fokker-Planck equation for
the probability distribution function of the velocity increments.
  Steady state solutions of this equation allows to qualitatively explain the
anomalous corrections and the skewness generation along scale.
