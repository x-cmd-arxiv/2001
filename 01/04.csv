dominant component of the radiated power; and all the spectra show evidence of
a high-energy turnover. Unless a new pulsed component appears at higher

can only be explained by an unusual energy component such as vacuum energy or
quintessence. To assess the ability of current and future supernova data to
constrain the properties of the dark energy, we allow its density to have
arbitrary time-dependence, $\rho_X(z)$. This leads to an equation of state for
the dark energy, $w_X(z)=p_X(z)/\rho_X(z)$, which is a free function of
redshift $z$. We find that current type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) data are
consistent with a cosmological constant, with large uncertainties at $z\ga
0.5$. We show that $\rho_X(z)/\rho_X(z=0)$ can be measured reasonably well to
about $z=1.5$ using type Ia supernova data from realistic future SN Ia pencil
beam surveys, provided that the weak energy condition (energy density of matter
is nonnegative for any observer) is imposed.
  While it is only possible to differentiate between different models (say,
quintessence and k-essence) at $z \la 1.5$ using realistic data, the correct
trend in the time-dependence of the dark energy density can be clearly detected
out to $z=2$, even in the presence of plausible systematic effects. This would
allow us to determine whether the dark energy is a cosmological constant, or
some exotic form of energy with a time-dependent density.

explanation of the uniform properties of kHz Quasi-periodic Oscillations (QPO)
observed in X-rays emitted by Low Mass X-ray Binary (LMXB) sources. The theory
outlined in this paper relates the intrinsic properties of NS structure to the
observed kHz frequencies. The range of kHz frequencies and the observed quality
factors (Qs) are also explained by this simple dynamical model. A scenario that
begins with the melting of the inner crust of an LMXB NS creates the conditions
necessary for the generation of kHz QPO. The theory relates the ratio of the
observed kHz frequencies to the ratios of the components of the moments of
inertia of the NS, thereby tightly constraining the equation of state (EOS) of
NS matter (polytrope index ~1.0). The TFP model is in strong contrast to
existing models which primarily relate the kHz QPO phenomenon to the physics of
gas dynamics near the inner edge of the accretion disk and the transition flow
onto the surface of the NS. We suggest the possibility of the direct detection
of very low frequency (~1 kHz) radio waves from magnetic dipole radiation and
also predict kHz gravitational wave emission from the LMXB Sco X-1 that may be
detectable by LIGO. The high accretion rates consistent with the predicted GW
emission indicate the likely conversion of some LMXBs to maximally rotating
Kerr black holes (BH) and further suggest that these systems are progenitors of

the observed profile for many realistic physical conditions. In a pure

spectrum from the CfA Redshift Survey which, lacking broad Balmer lines,
indicates that they appeared some time after 1980. Thus NGC 3065 joins the set
of LINERs with broad, variable Balmer lines, which includes such well-known
galaxies as NGC 1097 and M81. Inspired by the sometimes double-peaked profiles
of the variable Balmer lines in other LINERs, we speculate that the broad
Balmer lines of NGC 3065 also come from an accretion disk. We illustrate the
plausibility of this hypothesis by fitting a disk model to the observed
H$\alpha$ profile. We also estimate the mass of the central black hole as
(9+/-4) 10^7 M_sol from the properties of the host galaxy, which leads to the
conclusion that the accretion rate is only 2 10^{-4} times the Eddington value,
a property that appears to be common among LINERs. At such a low relative
accretion rate the inner accretion disk can turn into a vertically-extended ion
torus, which can illuminate the outer, thin disk and power the broad-line
emission. The reason for the sudden appearance of broad Balmer lines is an open
question, although we suggest two possible explanations: tidal disruption of a

(i) a single thermal component is sufficient to fit all the spectra; (ii) kT is
rather uniformly distributed with a minimum in the east and a maximum in the
west, and no evidence is found for high kT expected from the interaction of the
main shock with the ISM; (iii) from the distribution of the values of the

first (a) in the range 1-10 cm^(-3), the second (b) with values ten times
higher; if we associate component a to the CSM and component b to the ejecta,
the mass ratio M(a)/M(b)<= 1/10 indicates a progenitor star that lost only a
small fraction of the envelope during its pre-SN life. In this hypothesis the

not spherically symmetric; (iv) the distribution of abundances indicates that

infall of any entropy or vorticity perturbation produces acoustic waves
propagating outward. The dependence of this acoustic flux on the shape of the
perturbation is investigated in detail. This is the key process in the
mechanism of the entropic-acoustic instability proposed by Foglizzo & Tagger
(2000) to explain the instability of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion. These
acoustic waves create new entropy and vorticity perturbations when they reach
the shock, thus closing the entropic-acoustic cycle. With an adiabatic index
1<gamma<=5/3, the linearized equations describing the perturbations of the
Bondi flow are studied analytically and solved numerically. The fundamental
frequency of this problem is the cut-off frequency of acoustic refraction,
below which ingoing acoustic waves are refracted out. This cut-off is
significantly smaller than the Keplerian frequency at the sonic radius and
depends on the latitudinal number l of the perturbations. When advected
adiabatically inward, entropy and vorticity perturbations trigger acoustic
waves propagating outward, with an efficiency which is highest for non radial
perturbations l=1. The outgoing acoustic flux produced by the advection of
vorticity perturbations is always moderate and peaks at rather low frequency.
By contrast, the acoustic flux produced by an entropy wave is highest close to
the refraction cut-off. It can be very large if gamma is close to 5/3. These
results suggest that the shocked Bondi flow with gamma=5/3 is strongly unstable
with respect to the entropic-acoustic mechanism.

echelle spectra reveal emission lines from both the v=1 and v=2 vibrational
levels with line widths of roughly 70 km/s. The average CO excitation
temperature is approximately 1200 K. We model the spectra as arising from gas
in Keplerian rotation about the center-of-mass of the binary. The disk model
requires gas with an average surface density of 5 x 10-4 g cm-2 that extends
outward to 0.5 +/- 0.1 AU and inward to at least 0.1 AU from the
center-of-mass. The radial extent for the emitting gas is close to the
predicted size of the gap in the DQ Tau accretion disk that is expected to be
dynamically cleared by the binary. We interpret these results, and previous
modeling of DQ Tau's spectral energy distribution, as evidence for a small
amount (~ 1e-10 Msun) of diffuse material residing within the optically-thin
disk gap. Thus dynamical clearing has not been completely efficient in the DQ
Tau binary. We suggest that the material is associated with a flow from the
circumbinary disk which feeds the ongoing accretion at the stellar surfaces.

the charge ordered state forming at high-T is imperfect, due to quantum

extra dimension and to have a self-tuning solution, a three index antisymmetric
tensor field is introduced with the $1/H^2$ term in the Lagrangian. The
standard model fields are located at the $y=0$ brane. The existence
\cite{kklcc} of the self-tuning solution (which results without any fine tuning
among parameters in the Lagrangian) is crucial to obtain a vanishing
cosmological constant in a 4D effective theory. The de Sitter and anti de
Sitter space solutions are possible. The de Sitter space solutions have
horizons. Restricting to the spaces which contain the $y=0$ brane, the
vanishing cosmological constant is chosen in the most probable universe. For
this interpretaion to be valid, the existence of the self-tuning solution is
crucial in view of the phase transitions. In this paper, we show explicitly a
solution in case the brane tension shifts from one to another value. We also
discuss the case with the $H^2$ term which leads to one-fine-tuning solutions

3-manifold M, one can construct a pair of genuine laminations with solid torus
complementary regions which bind every leaf of F in a geodesic lamination.
These laminations come from a universal circle, a refinement of the universal
circles proposed by Thurston, which maps monotonely and group-equivariantly to
each of the circles at infinity of the leaves of the universal cover of F, and
is minimal with respect to this property. This circle is intimately bound up
with the extrinsic geometry of the leaves of F. In particular, for any pair of
leaves m,l of the universal cover of F with m>l, the leaf l is asymptotic to m
in a dense set of directions at infinity, where the leaf space is co-oriented
so that the foliation branches in the negative direction. This is a macroscopic
version of an infinitesimal result of Thurston's and gives much more drastic
control over the topology and geometry of F.
  The pair of laminations can be used to produce a pseudo-Anosov flow
transverse to F which is regulating in the non-branching direction. Rigidity
results for these laminations in the R-covered case are extended to the case of
one-sided branching. In particular, an R-covered foliation can only be deformed
to a foliation with one-sided branching along one of the two laminations
canonically associated to the R-covered foliation in math.GT/9903173, and these
laminations become exactly the laminations constructed for the new branched
foliation.
  Other corollaries include that the ambient manifold is d-hyperbolic in the
sense of Gromov, and that a self-homeomorphism of this manifold homotopic to
the identity is isotopic to the identity.

nuclear ground-state properties is given. The method is used to investigate
differential observables such as the odd-even mass differences and odd-even
effects in charge radii. For a few isotope chains of spherical nuclei, the
calculations are performed with an exact treatment of the Gor'kov equations in
the coordinate-space representation. A zero-range cutoff density-dependent
pairing interaction with a density-gradient term is used. The evolution of
charge radii and nucleon separation energies is reproduced reasonably well
including kinks at magic neutron numbers and sizes of staggering. It is shown
that the density-dependent pairing may also induce sizeable staggering and
kinks in the evolution of the mean energies of multipole excitations. The
results are compared with the conventional mean field Skyrme-HFB and
relativistic Hartree-BCS calculations. With the formulated approach, an
extrapolation from the pairing properties of finite nuclei to pairing in
infinite matter is considered, and the dilute limit near the critical point, at
which the regime changes from weak to strong pairing, is discussed.

fitness landscapes in which all mutations are either neutral or strongly
deleterious. We demonstrate that despite the absence of higher fitness
genotypes, adaptation takes place as regions with more advantageous
distributions of neutral genotypes are discovered. Since these discoveries are
typically rare events, the population dynamics can be subdivided into separate
epochs, with rapid transitions between them. Within one epoch, the average
fitness in the population is approximately constant. The transitions between
epochs, however, are generally accompanied by a significant increase in the
average fitness. We verify our theoretical considerations with two analytically
tractable bitstring models.

(employing complex Hilbert spaces, Hermitean operators, and the trace rule for

be derived from five very reasonable axioms. The first four of these are
obviously consistent with both quantum theory and classical probability theory.
Axiom 5 (which requires that there exists continuous reversible transformations
between pure states) rules out classical probability theory. If Axiom 5 (or
even just the word ""continuous"" from Axiom 5) is dropped then we obtain
classical probability theory instead. This work provides some insight into the
reasons quantum theory is the way it is. For example, it explains the need for
complex numbers and where the trace formula comes from. We also gain insight
into the relationship between quantum theory and classical probability theory.
