at periods ~1000, 500 and 250 d, correlated with changes in the pulse profile
(Stairs, Lyne & Shemar 2000). We study the extent to which these data can be
explained by precession of the star's rigid crust coupled to the magnetic
dipole torque. We find that the correlated changes in the pulse duration and
spin period derivative can be explained as precession at a period of ~500 d
with a wobble angle of ~3 deg if the star's dipole moment is nearly orthogonal
to its symmetry axis. The dipole torque produces a harmonic at ~250 d.
Comparison of the predicted spin dynamics with the observed pulse durations
requires the radio beam to have a non-standard ``hour-glass'' shape. We make
predictions of variations in beam polarization and pulse profile with which to
test this interpretation. The precession interpretation of PSR B1828-11
seriously challenges the current understanding of the liquid interior of the
neutron star. In particular, if the internal liquid is in a superfluid state,
its rotational vortices cannot be significantly pinned to the crust.

three magnitudes of the M31 halo are strongly present. Photometry of a more
distant control field to subtract field contamination is used to derive the

the M31 halo field. From the color distribution of the foreground Milky Way

the luminosity of the RGB tip, we determine a distance modulus (m-M)_o = 24.47

extensive new grid of RGB models (Vandenberg et al. 2000). The MDF is dominated
by a moderately high-metallicity population ([m/H]~ -0.5) found previously in
more interior M31 halo/bulge fields, and is much more metal-rich than the
[m/H]~ -1.5 level in the Milky Way halo. A significant (~30% - 40%, depending
on AGB star contribution) metal-poor population is also present. To first
order, the shape of the MDF resembles that predicted by a simple,
single-component model of chemical evolution starting from primordial gas with
an effective yield y=0.0055. It strongly resembles the MDF recently found for
the outer halo of the giant elliptical NGC 5128 (Harris et al. 2000), though
NGC 5128 has an even lower fraction of low-metallicity stars. Intriguingly, in
both NGC 5128 and M31, the metallicity distribution of the globular clusters in
M31 does not match the halo stars; the clusters are far more heavily weighted
to metal-poor objects. We suggest similarities in the formation and early

the disk is non-steady and that this produces both the multiple episodes of
star formation in the disk as well as the multiple epochs of radio source
activity. If the inner radio source and the youngest star forming region are
related by the same event of gas transport, the gas must be transported from

homogeneous scalar field and find that, contrary to naive expectations, such a

intriguing behaviour introduces an arrow of time in a system which is
time-reversible. The increase in the maximum size of the universe is closely
related to the work done on/by the scalar field during one complete oscillatory
cycle which, in turn, is related to the asymmetry in the scalar field equation
of state during expansion and collapse. Our analysis shows that scalar fields
with polynomial potentials $V(\phi) = \lambda \phi^q$, $q > 1$ lead to a
growing oscillation amplitude for the universe: the increase in amplitude
between successive oscillations is more significant for smaller values of $q$.
Such behaviour allows for the effective recycling of the universe. A recycled
universe can be quite old and can resolve the flatness problem. These results
have strong bearing on cosmological models in which the role of dark matter is
played by a scalar field. They are also relevant for chaotic inflationary
models of the early universe since they demonstrate that, even if the universe
fails to inflate the first time around, it will eventually do so during future
oscillatory cycles. Thus, the space of initial conditions favourable for

isotemperature statistics in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) sky, which
is induced by the gravitational lensing due to the intervening large-scale
structure of the universe. To develop the method, we focus on a specific
statistical property of the intrinsic Gaussian CMB field; a field point in the
map that has a larger absolute value of the temperature threshold tends to have
a larger absolute value of the curvature parameter defined by a trace of second
derivative matrix of the temperature field, while the ellipticity parameter
similarly defined is uniformly distributed independently of the threshold
because of the isotropic nature of the Gaussian field. The weak lensing then
causes a stronger distortion effect on the isotemperature contours with higher
threshold and especially induces a coherent distribution of the ellipticity
parameter correlated with the threshold as a result of the coupling between the
CMB curvature parameter and the gravitational tidal shear in the observed map.
These characteristic patterns can be statistically picked up by considering
three independent characteristic functions, which are obtained from the
averages of quadratic combinations of the second derivative fields of CMB over
isotemperature contours with each threshold. Consequently, we find that the
lensing effect generates non-Gaussian signatures on those functions that have a
distinct functional dependence of the threshold. We test the method using
numerical simulations of CMB maps and show that the lensing signals can be
measured definitely, provided that we use CMB data with sufficiently low noise
and high angular resolution.

valuable for future visible orbit determinations. It will yield empirical
masses for T Tauri stars that now are only poorly known. The available data is
however not sufficient to do this at the present time. Instead, we use short
series of orbital data and statistical distributions of orbital parameters to
derive an average system mass that is independent of theoretical assumptions

described by a bonding orbital picture, while the correlation hole has a
significant component due to the polarization of the nearby bonds, which
partially screens out the anisotropy in the exchange hole.

still show very different surface behavior: for DP some exponents are

negative time delay signalizing the underlying nonlocality. The superfield

motion. We discuss a possibility for the elimination of such derivative terms
by adding total derivative terms. Although the most of derivative terms can be

bicomplex numbers introduced by Segre. The theory of these functions is
associated with Fueter's theory of regular, quaternionic functions. The
algebras of quaternions and bicomplex numbers are developed by making use of
so-called complex pairs. Special attention is paid to singular bicomplex
numbers that lack an inverse. The elementary bicomplex functions are defined
and their properties studied. The derivative of a bicomplex function is defined
as the limit of a fraction with nonsingular denominator. The existence of the
derivative amounts to the validity of the complexified Cauchy-Riemann
equations, which characterize the holomorphic bicomplex functions. It is proved
that such a function has derivatives of all orders. The bicomplex integral is
defined as a line integral. The condition for path independence and the
bicomplex generalizations of Cauchy's theorem and integral formula are given.
Finally, the relationship between the bicomplex functions and different forms
of the Laplace equation is considered. In particular, the four-dimensional
Laplace equation is factorized using quaternionic differential operators. The
outcome is new classes of bicomplex functions including Fueter's regular
functions. It is shown that each class contains differentiable functions.

eigenvalue of L yields a physically measurable property of the dynamical

operator L in the weak noise limit can be computed in several ways. A method
using a local matrix representation of the operator allows to push the
corrections to the escape rate up to order eight in the noise expansion
parameter. These corrections then appear to form a divergent series. Actually,
via a cumulant expansion, they relate to analogous divergent series for other
quantities, the traces of the evolution operators L^n. Using an integral
representation of the evolution operator L, we then investigate the high order
corrections to the latter traces. Their asymptotic behavior is found to be
controlled by sub-dominant saddle points previously neglected in the
perturbative expansion, and to be ultimately described by a kind of trace
formula.

A280 (2001) 177","10.1016/S0375-9601(01)00049-4",,"quant-ph",,"  We discuss the temperature correction to the Casimir force between nonideal
metallic bodies which caused disagreement in the literature. A general method
to find the troubling term is proposed that does not require a direct reference
to the Lifshitz formula. The linear in temperature correction is shown to
survive for nonideal metals. It is important for small separations between
bodies tested in the recent experiments.

stationary quantum mechanics and its connection with quantum chaoticity is
discussed. It is shown that the earlier suggested quantum chaoticity criterion
characterizes destruction of initial symmetry of regular system and of basis
quantum numbers under influence of perturbation. The convergent procedure
allowing to construct approximate integrals of motion in the form of
non-trivial combinations depending on operators $(q,p)$ is suggested.
Properties of the obtained integrals with complicated structure and the
consequences of their existence for system's dynamics are discussed. The method
is used for explicit construction and investigation of the approximate
integrals in Henon-Heiles problem.
