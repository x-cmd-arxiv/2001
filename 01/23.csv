maintained between turbulence and random magnetic fields. Our results indicate
that a midplane value of $B_{0}=4\mkG$ for the regular magnetic field near the
Sun leads to more attractive models than $B_{0}=2\mkG$. The vertical profiles
of both the regular and random magnetic fields contain disc and halo components

overpressured and an outflow at a speed of about $50\kms$ may occur there,

show that hydrostatic equilibrium in a warped disc must produce asymmetric

warping mechanism in the Milky Way and other galaxies. We find indications that

fitted firstly by two Gaussian lines, which in four spectra have average
energies of 5.85+/-0.08 keV and 7.32+/-0.13 keV, strongly suggestive that these
are the red- and blueshifted wings of an iron disc line from material with
velocity ~0.33 c. The blue wing is apparently less bright than expected for a
disc line subject to Doppler boosting, however, known absorption in the
spectrum of GRO J1655-40 at energies between ~7 and 8 keV can reduce the
apparent brightness of the blue wing. The spectra have also been fitted well
using the full relativistic disc line model of Laor, plus an absorption line.
This gives a restframe energy between 6.4 and 6.8 keV indicating that the line
is from highly ionized iron K_alpha. The Laor model also shows that the line
originates at radii extending from ~10 Schwarzschild radii (r_S) outwards. The
line is direct evidence for the black hole nature of the compact object. The
continuum is well described by dominant disc blackbody emission plus
Comptonized emission. During dipping, spectral evolution is well modelled by
allowing progressive covering of the disc blackbody and simple absorption of
the Comptonized emission showing that the thermal emission is more extended.
Acceptable fits are only obtained by including the disc line in the covering
term, indicating that it originates in the same inner disc region as the
thermal continuum. Dip ingress times and durations are used to provide the
radius of the disc blackbody emitter as 170-370 r_S, and the radius of the
absorber.

These are vibrational modes that are trapped near the surface as a result of a
'potential barrier' caused by the sharp hydrogen partial ionization region.
Typically the modal number of the strange mode falls between the 7th and 12th
overtone, depending on the astrophysical parameters of the equilibrium stellar
models (L, M, \Teff, X, Z). Interestingly these modes can be linearly unstable
outside the usual instability strip, in which case they should be observable as
new kinds of variable stars, 'strange Cepheids' or 'strange RR Lyrae' stars.
The present paper reexamines the linear stability properties of the strange
modes by taking into account the effects of an isothermal atmosphere, and of
turbulent convection. It is found that the linear vibrational instability of
the strange modes is resistant to both of these effects. Nonlinear hydrodynamic
calculations indicate that the pulsation amplitude of these modes is likely to
saturate at the millimagnitude level. These modes should therefore be
detectable albeit not without effort.

coherent pulsations, there exist two more time-varying temporal structures at
frequencies of ~0.65-1.35 and ~2-20 mHz. These relatively long-term structures
appear in the power density spectra as mHz QPOs and as well-developed sidebands
around the coherent pulse frequency as well, indicating that the amplitudes of
the coherent pulsation is modulated by those of the mHz QPOs. One interesting
feature is that, while the first flare shows symmetric sidebands around the

the lower-frequency sidebands due to the ~2-20 mHz QPOs. We discuss the origin

to be possible to attribute the origin of the ~0.65-1.35 and ~2-20 mHz QPOs to
the beating between the rotational frequency of the neutron star and the

the orbital motion of clumps at Keplerian radii of 2-10 times 10^9 cm,

an excess of microlensing events beyond what is expected from known stellar

However, study of these events is limited by their small number and poor
photometric precision. The SNAP satellite, which has been proposed to search
for supernovae, would be an ideal instrument to search for microlensing events
towards the LMC. Due in part to its larger mirror, and largely to its superb
space-based seeing and low background, with a modest program SNAP will be able
to detect $\sim 250$ microlensing events per year. In addition, SNAP will
generate $\sim 16$ high quality events per year with 1% photometric resolution.
These data should break the microlensing degeneracy, and determine whether the
events are indeed due to dark matter lenses in the Galactic Halo. Side benefits
of such a program will include a never before equaled catalog of variable stars
in the LMC. On of the most intriguing possibilities is a direct measurement of
the distance to the LMC. Such a measurement will determine what is today the

by means of 2-D, MHD, non-isothermal simulations in the presence of model
radiative heating and cooling. We argue that dissipation in 2D is
representative of that in three dimensions as long as it is dominated by shocks
rather than by a turbulent cascade. Energy is injected at a few isolated sites
in space, over relatively small scales, and over short time periods. This leads
to the coexistence of forced and decaying regimes in the same flow. We find
that the ISM-like flow dissipates its turbulent energy rapidly. In simulations
with forcing, the input parameters are the radius l_f of the forcing region,
the total kinetic energy e_k each source deposits into the flow, and the rate
of formation of those regions, sfr_OB. The global dissipation time t_d depends
mainly on l_f. In terms of measurable properties of the ISM, t_d >= Sigma_g
u_rms^2/(e_k sfr_OB), where Sigma_g is the average gas surface density and
u_rms is the rms velocity dispersion. For the solar neighborhood, t_d >=
1.5x10^7 yr. The global dissipation time is consistently smaller than the
crossing time of the largest energy-containing scales. In decaying simulations,
Ek decreases with time as t^-n, where n~0.8-0.9. This suggests a decay with
distance d as Ek\propto d^{-2n/(2-n)} in the mixed forced+decaying case. If
applicable to the vertical direction, our results support models of galaxy
evolution in which stellar energy injection provides significant support for
the gas disk thickness, but not models of galaxy formation in which this energy
injection is supposed to reheat an intra-halo medium at distances of up to
10-20 times the optical galaxy size, as the dissipation occurs on distances
comparable to the disk height.

shock radius declines considerably more rapidly in the GR simulations than in
the corresponding Newtonian simulations. During the shock reheating phase, core
collapse computed with GR hydrodynamics results in a substantially more compact
structure from the center out to the stagnated shock. The inflow speed of
material behind the shock is also increased. Comparisons also show that the
luminosity and rms energy of any neutrino flavor during the shock reheating
phase increases when switching from Newtonian to GR hydrodynamics, and
decreases when switching from Newtonian to GR transport. This latter decrease
in neutrino luminosities and rms energies is less in magnitude than the
increase that arise when switching from Newtonian to GR hydrodynamics, with the

confirmed and one candidate low redshift damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAS). HI
absorption was detected in the two confirmed systems, at z=0.2378 and z=0.5247,
with spin temperatures (Ts) of 2050 +- 200 K and 330 +- 70 K respectively. The
non-detection of absorption in the third (candidate) system places an upper
limit on its optical depth, which in turn implies a 3sigma lower limit of 850 K
on its spin temperature. Ground based K-band imaging observations (Turnshek et
al. 2000) have identified the low Ts absorber with a spiral galaxy while the
high Ts system appears to be an LSB galaxy. This continues the trend noted
earlier by Chengalur and Kanekar (2000) of low spin temperatures for DLAS
associated with spiral galaxies and high spin temperatures for those with no
such association.
  Combining these new results with 21cm observations from the published
literature, we find that (1)The 21 cm equivalent width (EW21) of DLAS increases
with increasing column density (NHI). Further, absorbers associated with spiral
galaxies have systematically higher EW21 at the same NHI than DLAS with no such
association, (2)DLAS at high redshift (z > 2) have small velocity spreads
(DeltaV), while, at low redshift (z < 2), both large and small DeltaV are
observed. These trends are in qualitative agreement with hierarchical models of
galaxy formation.

the slope of the M_BH-M_bulge relation. The combined sample of 40 active and
non-active galaxies suggests a significantly nonlinear relation, M_BH\propto
M_bulge^{1.53\pm 0.14}. Further support for a nonlinear relation is provided by
the slope of the M_BH-stellar velocity dispersion relation found recently, and
by the low M_BH found in late type spiral galaxies. The mean M_BH/M_bulge ratio
is therefore not a universal constant, but rather drops from ~0.5% in bright

Monte Carlo simulation of a model of a $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ (maghemite) single
particle. Periodic boundary conditions have been used to simulate the bulk
properties and the results compared with those for a spherical shaped particle
with free boundaries to evidence the role played by the surface on the
anomalous magnetic properties displayed by these systems at low temperatures.
Several outcomes of the model are in qualitative agreement with the
experimental findings. A reduction of the magnetic ordering temperature,
spontaneous magnetization, and coercive field is observed as the particle size
is decreased. Moreover, the hysteresis loops become elongated with high values
of the differential susceptibility, resembling those from frustrated or
disordered systems. These facts are consequence of the formation of a surface
layer with higher degree of magnetic disorder than the core, which, for small
sizes, dominates the magnetization processes of the particle. However, in
contradiction with the assumptions of some authors, our model does not predict
the freezing of the surface layer into a spin-glass-like state. The results
indicate that magnetic disorder at the surface simply facilitates the thermal
demagnetization of the particle at zero field, while the magnetization is
increased at moderate fields, since surface disorder diminishes ferrimagnetic
correlations within the particle. The change in shape of the hysteresis loops
with the particle size demonstrates that the reversal mode is strongly
influenced by the reduced atomic coordination and disorder at the surface.

exhibits a T-linear decrease at low temperatures, with the magnitude of the

  Encodings of Graphs",,"SIAM Journal on Computing, 30(3):838--846, 2000",,,"cs.DS cs.GR",,"  We propose a fast methodology for encoding graphs with
information-theoretically minimum numbers of bits. Specifically, a graph with
property pi is called a pi-graph. If pi satisfies certain properties, then an
n-node m-edge pi-graph G can be encoded by a binary string X such that (1) G
and X can be obtained from each other in O(n log n) time, and (2) X has at most
beta(n)+o(beta(n)) bits for any continuous super-additive function beta(n) so
that there are at most 2^{beta(n)+o(beta(n))} distinct n-node pi-graphs. The
methodology is applicable to general classes of graphs; this paper focuses on
planar graphs. Examples of such pi include all conjunctions over the following
groups of properties: (1) G is a planar graph or a plane graph; (2) G is
directed or undirected; (3) G is triangulated, triconnected, biconnected,
merely connected, or not required to be connected; (4) the nodes of G are
labeled with labels from {1, ..., ell_1} for ell_1 <= n; (5) the edges of G are
labeled with labels from {1, ..., ell_2} for ell_2 <= m; and (6) each node
(respectively, edge) of G has at most ell_3 = O(1) self-loops (respectively,
ell_4 = O(1) multiple edges). Moreover, ell_3 and ell_4 are not required to be
O(1) for the cases of pi being a plane triangulation. These examples are novel
applications of small cycle separators of planar graphs and are the only
nontrivial classes of graphs, other than rooted trees, with known
polynomial-time information-theoretically optimal coding schemes.

control dynamic scheduling is provided in existing languages in the form of
delay declarations.
  Input-consuming derivations were introduced to describe dynamic scheduling
while abstracting from the technical details. In this paper, we first formalise
the relationship between delay declarations and input-consuming derivations,
showing in many cases a one-to-one correspondence. Then, we define a
model-theoretic semantics for input-consuming derivations of simply-moded

stochastic games. In particular, we consider a sequence of entirely arbitrary
distinct values arriving in random order, and must devise strategies for
selecting low values followed by high values in such a way as to maximize the
expected gain in rank from low values to high values.
  First, we consider a scenario in which only one low value and one high value
may be selected. We give an optimal on-line algorithm for this scenario, and
analyze it to show that, surprisingly, the expected gain is n-O(1), and so
differs from the best possible off-line gain by only a constant additive term
(which is, in fact, fairly small -- at most 15).
  In a second scenario, we allow multiple nonoverlapping low/high selections,
where the total gain for our algorithm is the sum of the individual pair gains.
We also give an optimal on-line algorithm for this problem, where the expected
gain is n^2/8-\Theta(n\log n). An analysis shows that the optimal expected
off-line gain is n^2/6+\Theta(1), so the performance of our on-line algorithm
is within a factor of 3/4 of the best off-line strategy.

  figures",,,,"cs.PL",,"  Complementation, the inverse of the reduced product operation, is a technique
for systematically finding minimal decompositions of abstract domains. File'
and Ranzato advanced the state of the art by introducing a simple method for
computing a complement. As an application, they considered the extraction by
complementation of the pair-sharing domain PS from the Jacobs and Langen's
set-sharing domain SH. However, since the result of this operation was still
SH, they concluded that PS was too abstract for this. Here, we show that the
source of this result lies not with PS but with SH and, more precisely, with
the redundant information contained in SH with respect to ground-dependencies
and pair-sharing. In fact, a proper decomposition is obtained if the
non-redundant version of SH, PSD, is substituted for SH. To establish the
results for PSD, we define a general schema for subdomains of SH that includes
PSD and Def as special cases. This sheds new light on the structure of PSD and
exposes a natural though unexpected connection between Def and PSD. Moreover,
we substantiate the claim that complementation alone is not sufficient to
obtain truly minimal decompositions of domains. The right solution to this
problem is to first remove redundancies by computing the quotient of the domain
with respect to the observable behavior, and only then decompose it by
complementation.

varying with the Higgs field in the wall are essential. Since in the MSSM there
is no indication of spontaneous CP violation around the critical temperature
(contrary to the NMSSM) we have to rely on standard explicit CP violation.
Using the WKB approximation for particles in the plasma we are led to Boltzmann
transport equations for the difference of left-handed particles and their CP
conjugates. This asymmetry is finally transformed into a baryon asymmetry by
out of equilibrium sphaleron transitions in the symmetric phase. We solve the
transport equations and find a baryon asymmetry depending mostly on the CP

radiation pressure. It also experiences a motional force, related to force
fluctuations through fluctuation-dissipation relations. The resulting position
fluctuations of the coupled mirror are related to the dissipative part of the
mechanical admittance. We compute the time dependent position commutator, which
makes apparent the difference between the low-frequency and high-frequency
masses, and the anticommutator noise spectrum, which describes the ultimate
sensitivity in a length measurement using mirrors.

curvatures, using the framework of linear response theory which connects these
fluctuations to dissipation mechanisms arising when stress tensors and
spacetime metric are coupled. Vacuum fluctuations of spacetime curvatures are
shown to be a sum of two contributions at lowest orders; the first one
corresponds to vacuum gravitational waves and is restricted to light-like
wavevectors and vanishing Einstein curvature, while the second one arises from
gravity of vacuum stress tensors. From these fluctuations, we deduce noise
spectra for geodesic deviations registered by probe fields which determine
ultimate limits in length or time measurements. In particular, a relation
between noise spectra characterizing spacetime fluctuations and the number of
massless neutrino fields is obtained.
