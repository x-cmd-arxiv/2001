X-ray Observatory has resolved a mystery regarding the proposed presence of a
dark matter object in the lens plane of this system. The Chandra ACIS
observation has clearly detected the lensed images of 2016+112 with positions
in good agreement with those reported in the optical and also detects 13
additional X-ray sources within a radius of 3.5 arcmin. Previous X-ray
observations in the direction of 2016+112 with the ROSAT HRI and ASCA SIS have
interpreted the X-ray data as arising from extended emission from a dark
cluster. However, the present Chandra observation can account for all the X-ray
emission as originating from the lensed images and additional point X-ray
sources in the field. Thus cluster parameters based on previous X-ray
observations are unreliable. We estimate an upper limit on the mass-to-light
ratio within a radius of 800 h_(50)^(-1) kpc of M/L_(V) < 190 h_(50)
(M/L_(V))_Sun. The lensed object is quite unusual, with reported narrow
emission lines in the optical that suggest it may be a type-2 quasar (Yamada
et. al. 1999). Our modeling of the X-ray spectrum of the lensed object implies
that the column density of an intrinsic absorber must lie between 3 and 85 x
10^22 cm^-2 (3 sigma confidence level). The 2-10 keV luminosity of the lensed
object, corrected for the lens magnification effect and using the above range
of intrinsic absorption, is 3 x 10^43 - 1.4 x 10^44 erg/s.

a shock wave remains the most attractive model for the production of energetic
cosmic rays. This process has been analyzed extensively during the past two
decades using the ``two-fluid'' model of diffusive shock acceleration. It is
well known that 1, 2, or 3 distinct solutions for the flow structure can be
found depending on the upstream parameters. The precise nature of the critical
conditions delineating the number and character of shock transitions has
remained unclear, mainly due to the inappropriate choice of parameters used in
the determination of the upstream boundary conditions. We derive the exact
critical conditions by reformulating the upstream boundary conditions in terms
of two individual Mach numbers defined with respect to the cosmic-ray and gas
sound speeds, respectively. The gas and cosmic-ray adiabatic indices are
assumed to remain constant throughout the flow, although they may have
arbitrary, independent values. Our results provide for the first time a
complete, analytical classification of the parameter space of shock transitions
in the two-fluid model. When multiple solutions are possible, we propose using
the associated entropy distributions as a means for indentifying the most
stable configuration.

occur a strong generation of gravitational waves (GWs) during the formation of

show that the difference is approximately constant over the ~2A (~15 resolution

  (Latex), to appear in the Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/320244",,"astro-ph",,"  We have examined the physical conditions in intrinsic UV-absorbing gas in the
Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151, using echelle spectra obtained with the Space
Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). We confirm the presence of the kinematic
components detected in earlier GHRS observations as well as a new broad
absorption feature at a radial velocity of -1680 km/s. The UV continuum of NGC
4151 decreased by a factor of 4 over the previous two years, and we argue the
changes in the column density of the low ionization absorption lines associated
with the broad component at -490 km/s reflect the decrease in the ionizing
flux. Most of the strong absorption lines (e.g., N V, C IV, Si IV) from this
component are saturated, but show substantial residual flux in their cores,
indicating that the absorber does not fully cover the source of emission. Our
interpretation is that the unocculted light is due to scattering by free
electrons from an extended region, which reflects continuum, emission lines,
and absorption lines. We have been able to constrain the densities for the
kinematic components based on absorption lines from metastable states of C III
and Fe II, and/or the ratios of ground and fine structure lines of O I,C II,
and Si II. We have generated a set of photoionization models which match the
ionic column densities for each component during the present low flux state and
those seen in previous high flux states with the GHRS and STIS, confirming that
the absorbers are photoionized and respond to the changes in the continuum
flux. We have been able to map the relative radial positions of the absorbers,
and find that the gas decreases in density with distance. None of the UV
absorbers is of sufficiently large column density or high enough ionization
state to account for the X-ray absorption.

1068, obtained with ISOCAM in low-resolution spectro-imaging mode. The spatial
resolution (around 5 arcsec) allows us to disentangle the circumnuclear
starburst regions from the emission of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The
global spatial distribution of the Unidentified Infrared Bands (UIBs) is
similar to the cold dust component, traced by the 450 microns emission and the
gaseous component obtained from the CO(1-0) map. However, a shift between the
maximum of the UIB and 450 microns emission is clearly seen in our maps. The
UIBs in the MIR (5-16 microns) originate almost exclusively from the starburst
regions in the galactic disk with an emission peaking at the extremity of the
stellar/ gaseous bar at a distance of 1 kpc from the AGN. The spectrum of the
nucleus is characterized over the whole 5-16 microns range by a strong
continuum which can be fitted with a power law of index -1.7. Moreover, the
high [NeIII]/[NeII] ratio (>2.5) in the nuclear region argues for a hard
radiation field from the AGN. Observations indicate that the AGN in NGC 1068
contributes less than 5% to the total integrated UIB emission even though its
hot dust continuum contributes as much as 75% to the total MIR flux. On the
contrary, the nuclear contribution to the cold dust emission decreases
considerably at submillimeter wavelengths and does not represent more than 25%
of the total integrated emission at 450 microns.

particle physics and cosmology. Current fashionable supersymmetric models
provide a natural dark matter candidate which is the lightest supersymmetric
particle (LSP). The allowed parameter space of such models combined with fairly
well understood physics (quark substructure of the nucleon and nuclear
structure) permit the evaluation of the event rate for LSP-nucleus elastic
scattering. The thus obtained event rates, which sensitively depend on the
allowed parameter space parameters, are usually very low or even undetectable.
  So, for background reduction, one would like to exploit two nice features of
the reaction, the directional rate, which depends on the sun's direction of
motion and the modulation effect, i.e. the dependence of the event rate on the
earth's annual motion. In the present paper we study these phenomena in a
specific class of non isothermal models, which take into account the late
in-fall of dark matter into our galaxy, producing flows of caustic rings. We
find that the modulation effect arising from such models is smaller than that
found previously with isothermal symmetric velocity distributions and much
smaller compared to that obtained using a realistic asymmetric distribution
with enhanced dispersion in the galactocentric direction.

coannihilation effects are shown to be sensitive to A_0 for large tan \beta. In
all models, current detectors are sampling parts of the paramater space i. e.

calculus. There is a correspondence between important, useful and interesting
constructions and results over the field of real (or complex) numbers and
similar constructions and results over idempotent semirings in the spirit of N.
Bohr's correspondence principle in Quantum Mechanics.
  Some problems nonlinear in the traditional sense (for example, the Bellman
equation and its generalizations) turn out to be linear over a suitable
semiring; this linearity considerably simplifies the explicit construction of
solutions.
  The theory is well advanced and includes, in particular, new integration
theory, new linear algebra, spectral theory and functional analysis. It has a
wide range of applications.
  Besides a survey of the subject, in this paper the correspondence principle
is used to develop an approach to object-oriented software and hardware design
for algorithms of idempotent calculus.

  pseudo-integrable systems","61 pages, 13 figures. Submitted to Communications in Mathematical
  Physics, 2000",,"10.1007/s002200100516",,"nlin.CD",,"  The 2-point correlation form factor, $K_2(\tau)$, for small values of $\tau$
is computed analytically for typical examples of pseudo-integrable systems.
This is done by explicit calculation of periodic orbit contributions in the
diagonal approximation. The following cases are considered: (i) plane billiards
in the form of right triangles with one angle $\pi/n$ and (ii) rectangular
billiards with the Aharonov-Bohm flux line. In the first model, using the
properties of the Veech structure, it is shown that
$K_2(0)=(n+\epsilon(n))/(3(n-2))$ where $\epsilon(n)=0$ for odd $n$,
$\epsilon(n)=2$ for even $n$ not divisible by 3, and $\epsilon(n)=6$ for even
$n$ divisible by 3. For completeness we also recall informally the main
features of the Veech construction. In the second model the answer depends on
arithmetical properties of ratios of flux line coordinates to the corresponding
sides of the rectangle. When these ratios are non-commensurable irrational
numbers, $K_2(0)=1-3\bar{\alpha}+4\bar{\alpha}^2$ where $\bar{\alpha}$ is the
fractional part of the flux through the rectangle when $0\le \bar{\alpha}\le
1/2$ and it is symmetric with respect to the line $\bar{\alpha}=1/2$ when $1/2
\le \bar{\alpha}\le 1$. The comparison of these results with numerical
calculations of the form factor is discussed in detail. The above values of
$K_2(0)$ differ from all known examples of spectral statistics, thus confirming
analytically the peculiarities of statistical properties of the energy levels
in pseudo-integrable systems.

of full three-dimensional numerical simulations. The flow is bounded by free
surfaces and driven by a volume force. Three regions in the spanwise spot
cross-section can be identified: a turbulent interior, an interface layer with
prominent streamwise streaks and vortices and a laminar exterior region with a
large scale flow induced by the presence of the spot. The lift-up of streamwise
streaks which is caused by non-normal amplification is clearly detected in the
region adjacent to the spot interface. The spot can be characterized by an
exponentially decaying front that moves with a speed different from that of the
cross-stream outflow or the spanwise phase velocity of the streamwise roll
pattern. Growth of the spots seems to be intimately connected to the large
scale outside flow, for a turbulent ribbon extending across the box in
downstream direction does not show the large scale flow and does not grow.
Quantitatively, the large scale flow induces a linear instability in the
neighborhood of the spot, but the associated front velocity is too small to
explain the spot spreading.

the classes of GEQS that include a system with a cranked Hamiltonian
$H(t)=e^{-iKt}H_0e^{iKt}$. We show that the cranking operator $K$ also belongs
to this class. Hence, in spite of the fact that it is time-independent, it
leads to nontrivial cyclic evolutions and geometric phases. Our analysis allows
for an explicit construction of a complete set of nonstationary cyclic states

states is half the characteristic period of the oscillator.
