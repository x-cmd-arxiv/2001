planetesimal disk was disrupted by a close stellar encounter. We trace the
space motions of 21,497 stars and discover 18 that have passed within 5 pc of
Beta Pic in the past 1 Myr. Beta Pic's closest encounter is with the K2III star
HIP 27628 (0.6 pc), but dynamically the most important encounter is with the
F7V star HIP 23693 (0.9 pc). We calculate the velocity and eccentricity changes
induced by the 18 perturbations and conclude that they are dynamically
significant if planetesimals exist in a Beta Pic Oort cloud. We provide a
first-order estimate for the evolutionary state of a Beta Pic Oort cloud and
conclude that the primary role of these stellar perturbations would be to help
build a comet cloud rather than destroy a pre-existing structure. The stellar
sample is 20% complete and motivates future work to identify less common close
interactions that would significantly modify the observed circumstellar disk.
For future radial velocity study we identify six stars in the Hipparcos Catalog

hydrogen burning via the CNO cycle. By virtue of its two excess neutrons
(relative to the predominant A=2Z nuclei), a downward force of 2m_pg is exerted
on 22Ne in the WD interior. This biases its diffusive equilibrium, forcing 22Ne
to settle towards the center of the WD. We discuss the physics of the
gravitational settling when the WD is in the liquid state and the luminosity
generated by it. This modifies the cooling of WD's with masses in excess of a
solar mass. The current uncertainties in the microphysics even allow for
solutions where a 1.2M_\odot WD remains mostly liquid for a few Gyrs due to the
internal heating from 22Ne sedimentation. This highlights the need for an
accurate calculation of the inter-diffusion coefficient, especially in the
quantum liquid regime relevant for high mass WD's. There is also time in old,
liquid WD's (such as those found in cataclysmic variables and possibly in
accreting Type Ia progenitors) for partial settling.

correlations in their projected orientations. Such alignments arise from the
tidal torques exerted on neighboring proto-galaxies by the smoothly varying
shear field. Weak gravitational lensing can also induce ellipticity
correlations since the images of neighboring galaxies will be distorted
coherently by the intervening mass distribution. Comparing these two sources of
shape correlations, it is found that for current weak lensing surveys with a
median redshift of 1, the intrinsic signal is a contaminant on the order of
1-10% of the measured signal. However, for shallower surveys, the intrinsic
correlations dominate over the lensing signal. The distortions induced by
lensing are curl-free, whereas those resulting from intrinsic alignments are
not. This difference can be used to disentangle these two sources of
ellipticity correlations. When the distortions are dominated by lensing, as
occurs at high redshifts, the decomposition provides a valuable tool for
understanding properties of the noise and systematic errors.

anisotropy resulting from patchy reionization. It is well known that the
primordial polarization of the CMB is very sensitive to the details of
reionization. Combining a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, in which the
optical depth to the reionization epoch is in the range 0.014 to 0.048, with a
high resolution N-body simulation we find that reionization generates a peak
with amplitude 0.05~0.15 \mu K at large angular scales. The position of this
peak reveals the size of the horizon at reionization, whilst its amplitude is a
measure of the optical depth to reionization. On small scales, ionized patches
prior to full reionization create a second order polarization signal due to the
coupling of the free electron density fluctuation with the quadrupole moment of
the temperature anisotropy. Careful study reveals that the coupling generates
the same power spectra for electric and magnetic modes, whose amplitudes of
polarization anisotropies from this process are predicted to be ~10nK. The
amplitude depends strongly on the total baryon density $\Omega_b$ and on the
spatial correlations of the free electron density in the ionized regions, and
weakly on the fraction of ionizing photons able to escape their source galaxy,
$f_{esc}$. The first- and second-order signals are therefore sensitive to the
details of how the reionization occurred. Detection of these signals will place
important constraints on the reionization history of the Universe.

locations and turn-offs are identical within the errors. Since we know from the
brighter evolved stars that the metallicities for these two disparate systems

of faint LFs is then equivalent to comparison of the low-mass stellar Initial

highest apparent M/L ratios known in the Local Group, and is an extremely low

speculated that these features are photospheric dust clouds, with their

possibility is magnetically-induced surface features. However, chromospheric

address the specific issue of whether we would be able to detect the O2 A-band
absorption feature in the atmosphere of a planet similar to the Earth, if it
were in orbit around a nearby star. Our method is empirical, in that we use
observations of the Earth's O2 A-band, with a simple geometric modification for
a transiting extra-solar planet, allowing for limb-darkening of the host star.
We simulate the spectrum of the host star with the superposed O2 A-band
absorption of the transiting planet, assuming a spectral resolution of 7 km/s
(typical of current echelle spectrographs), for a range of spectral
signal-to-noise ratios. The main result is that we could reliably detect the O2
A-band of the transiting planet for host stars with radii 0.3 solar or less.
However, using existing instrumentation and 8m telescopes, this requires target
M stars with m(V) of approximately 10 or brighter for integration times of
about 10 hours or less. The number of such stars over the sky is small. Larger
aperture telescopes and/or improved instrumentation efficiency would enable
surveys of M stars down to m(V) = 13 and greatly improve the chances of
discovering life elsewhere.

into the glassy phase. DLS allows to follow the diffusion of Laponite particles
and reveals that there are two modes of relaxation. The fast mode corresponds
to a rapid diffusion of particles within ""cages"" formed by the neighboring
particles. The slow mode corresponds to escape from the cages: its average
relaxation time increases exponentially fast with the age of the glass. In
addition, the slow mode has a broad distribution of relaxation times, its
distribution becoming larger as the system ages. Measuring the concomitant
increase of viscosity as the system ages, we can relate the slowing down of the
particle dynamics to the viscosity.

and vanishes at $u=0$. A variational principle for the minimal speed of the
waves is constructed from which upper and lower bounds are obtained. This
permits the a priori assesment of the effect of the convective term on the
minimal speed of the traveling fronts. If the convective term is not strong
enough, it produces no effect on the minimal speed of the fronts. We show that
if $f''(u)/\sqrt{f'(0)} + \mu \phi'(u) < 0$, then the minimal speed is given by
the linear value $2 \sqrt{f'(0)}$, and the convective term has no effect on the
minimal speed. The results are illustrated by applying them to the exactly
