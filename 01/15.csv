fields. Recent work has shown that source crowding can induce significant
positional errors in SIM's astrometric measurements, even for targets many
magnitudes brighter than all other crowding sources. Here we investigate
whether the spectral decomposition of the fringe pattern may be used to
disentangle the overlapping fringes from multiple blended sources, effectively
by performing synthesis imaging with two baselines. We find that spectrally
dispersed fringes enable SIM to identify and localize a limited number of field
sources quite robustly, thereby removing their effect from SIM astrometry and
reducing astrometry errors to near photon noise levels. We simulate SIM
measurements of the LMC, and show that (a) SIM astrometry will not be corrupted
by blending and (b) extremely precise imaging of mildly crowded fields may be
performed using only two orthogonal baseline orientations, allowing
microarcsecond positional measurements. We lastly illustrate the method's
potential with the example of astrometric microlensing, showing that SIM's mass
and distance measurements of lenses will be untainted by crowding.

Newtonian universe is revisited following the work of Bisnovatyi-Kogan and
Zel'dovich. We propose a more general analytical approach: a system of free
particles satisfying semi-degenerate Fermi-Dirac statistics on the background
of an exact expanding solution is examined in the linear approximation. This
differs from the corresponding work of Bisnovatyi-Kogan and Zel'dovich where
classical particles fulfilling Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics were considered.
The solutions of the Boltzmann equation are obtained by the method of
characteristics. An expression for the damping time of a decaying solution is
discussed and a zone in which free streaming is hampered is found,
corresponding to wavelengths less than the Jeans one. In the evolution of the
system, due to the decrease of the Jeans length, those perturbations may lead
to gravitational collapse. At variance with current opinions, we deduce that
perturbations with lambda >=lambda_(J Max)/1.48 are able to generate structures
and the lower limit for substructures mass is M = M_(J max)/(1.48)^3 ~ M_(J
max)/3, where M_(J max) is the maximum value of the Jeans mass.

large (7''-30'') image separations, which probe masses on the scale of galaxy
clusters. We have carried out a survey for gravitationally-lensed objects,
among sources in the FIRST 20cm radio survey that have unresolved optical
counterparts in the digitizations of the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey. From
the statistics of ongoing surveys that search for quasars among FIRST sources,
we estimate that there are about 9100 quasars in this source sample, making
this one of the largest lensing surveys to date. Using broad-band imaging, we
have isolated all objects with double radio components separated by 5''-30'',
that have unresolved optical counterparts with similar BVI colours. Our
criteria for similar colours conservatively allow for observational error and
for colour variations due to time delays between lensed images. Spectroscopy of
these candidates shows that none of the pairs are lensed quasars. This sets an
upper limit (95% confidence) on the lensing fraction in this survey of
3.3x10^-4, assuming 9100 quasars. Although the source redshift distribution is
poorly known, a rough calculation of the expected lensing frequency and the
detection efficiencies and biases suggests that simple theoretical expectations
are of the same order of magnitude as our observational upper limit. Our
procedure is novel in that our exhaustive search for lensed objects does not
require prior identification of the quasars in the sample as such.
Characterization of the FIRST-selected quasar population will enable using our
result to constrain quantitatively the mass properties of clusters.

very good understanding of the different aspects of cosmic ray propagation is
therefore necessary. In this paper, we use cosmic ray nuclei data to give
constraints on the diffusion parameters. Propagation is studied with
semi-analytical solutions of a diffusion model, and we give new analytical
solutions for radioactively produced species. Our model includes convection and
reacceleration as well as the standard energy losses. We perform a $\chi^2$
analysis over B/C data for a large number of configurations obtained by varying
the relevant parameters of the diffusion model. A very good agreement with B/C
data arises for a number of configurations, all of which are compatible with
sub-Fe/Fe data. Different source spectra $Q(E)$ and diffusion coefficients
$K(E)$ have been tried, but for both parameters only one form gives a good fit.
Another important result is that models without convection or without
reacceleration are excluded. We find that the various parameters, i.e. the
diffusion coefficient normalisation $K_0$ and spectral index $\delta$, the halo
thickness $L$, the Alfv\'en velocity $V_a$, and the convection velocity $V_c$
are strongly correlated. We obtain limits on the spectral index $\delta$ of

cluster has formula [(tacn)6Fe8O2(OH)12Br4.3(ClO4)3.7]6H2O, (Fe8PCL) where tacn
is the organic ligand 1,4,7-triazacyclononane. It can be considered a
derivative of Fe8Br8, a cluster whose low temperature dynamics of the
magnetization has been deeply investigated, where four of the bromide ions have
been replaced by perchlorate anions. The structure of the central core of the
two molecules, [Fe8O(OH)12(tacn)6]8+, is essentially the same, but Fe8PCL has a
higher symmetry (Fe8Br8 crystallizes in the acentric P1 space group, while
Fe8PCL crystallizes in the P21/c space group, monoclinic). The magnetic
properties of Fe8PCL suggest it is very similar to Fe8Br having a S=10 ground
state as well. The zero field splitting parameters were accurately determined
by HF-EPR measurements. The two clusters have similar axial anisotropy but
Fe8PCL has a larger transverse anisotropy. Ac susceptibility measurements
revealed the cluster behaves like a superparamagnetic particle. However, due to
the occurrence of large terms in the transverse anisotropy, the temperature
dependence of the relaxation time can not be reproduced by a simple Arrhenius
law. As observed in Fe8Br8, below 350 mK the relaxation time becomes
temperature independent, indicating that a pure tunneling regime is attained.
The comparison of the tunneling rate in the two clusters shows that in the
perchlorate derivative the relaxation process is 35 times faster. The observed
ratio of the tunneling rates is in reasonable agreement with that calculated
from the tunneling splitting, i.e. the energy difference between the two almost
degenerate lowest levels Ms = +/-10, in the two clusters.

analize four cases. The first one is non- relativistic quantum mechanics in
parametrized form. We show that, for the free particle case, the standard
choice of time is the only one leading to self-adjoint evolving constants.
Secondly, we study the relativistic case. We show that the resulting quantum
theory is the free particle representation of the Klein Gordon equation in
which the position is a perfectly well defined quantum observable. The
admissible choices of clock variables are the ones leading to space-like
simultaneity surfaces. In order to mimic the structure of General Relativity we
study the SL(2R) model with two Hamiltonian constraints. The evolving constants
depend in this case on three independent variables. We show that it is possible
to find clock variables and inner products leading to a consistent quantum

compact constraint surface. All the models considered may be consistently
quantized, although some of them do not admit any time choice such that the
equal time surfaces are transversal to the orbits.

For N=1 Green-Schwarz superstring we propose a modified action which is
equivalent to the initial one. Fermionic first and second class constraints are
covariantly separated, the first class constraints turn out to be irreducible.
We discuss also equations of motion in the covariant gauge for
$\kappa$-symmetry. For type IIA theory the same modification leads to
formulation with irreducible second class constraints.

were introduced and applied to noncommutative tori. These include connections
on finite projective modules, their curvature, and the Chern character. Finite
projective modules on the noncommutative two-torus $ \Tb^2_{\theta}$ were
realized as Schwartz spaces of vector valued functions on $\Rb$. Explicit
constant curvature connections were constructed and a basic integrality
phenomenon of the total curvature was displayed. The pseudo-differential
calculus and the Atiyah-Singer index theorems were extended to Lie group
actions on $C^*$ algebras and used to explain the above integrality of the
total curvature by an index formula for finite difference-differential
operators on the line. Recent interest in the hep-th literature for basic
notions of noncommutative geometry in the case of noncommutative tori (cf for
instance hep-th/0012145 for an excellent review) prompted us to make the
