been known to be viscously, thermally, and convectively unstable, but the
nonlinear development of these instabilities---hence the actual state of such
disks---has not yet been identified. By performing local two-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations of disks, we demonstrate that convective motions can
release heat sufficiently rapidly as to substantially alter the vertical
structure of the disk. If the dissipation rate within a vertical column is
proportional to its mass, the disk settles into a new configuration thinner by
a factor of two than the standard radiation-supported equilibrium. If, on the
other hand, the vertically-integrated dissipation rate is proportional to the
vertically-integrated total pressure, the disk is subject to the well-known
thermal instability. Convection, however, biases the development of this
instability toward collapse. The end result of such a collapse is a gas
pressure-dominated equilibrium at the original column density.

observational galaxy statistics are examined here using the ArFus N-body plus
semi-analytical galaxy modelling software.
  Upper and lower bounds on stellar losses implied by a given set of N-body
simulation output data can be investigated by choice of the merging/identity
criterion of haloes between successive N-body simulation output times. A median
merging/identity criterion is defined and used to deduce an upper estimate of
possible star formation and stellar population losses. A largest successor
merging/identity criterion is defined to deduce an estimate which minimises
stellar losses.
  In the N-body simulations studied, the debris losses are short range in
length and temporary; maximum loss is around 16%.
  The induced losses for star formation and luminosity functions are strongest
(losses of 10%-30%) for low luminosity galaxies and at intermediate redshifts
(1 < z < 3). This upper bound on likely losses is smaller than present
observational uncertainties. Hence, Press-Schechter based galaxy formation
models are approximately valid despite ignoring loss of debris, provided that

west of the brighter nebulosity. The spectra are in the H bandpass (1.4-1.95

Absorption by water vapour bands is detected in all the substellar candidates
except one, which is a highly reddened object with strong H2 emission and an
anomalously blue (I-J) colour, implying that it is a very young cluster member
with circumstellar matter. The observation of prominent water vapour bands
confirms the low Effective Temperatures implied by our (I-J) colour
measurements in an earlier paper and would imply late M or L spectral types if
these were older field dwarfs. However, the profiles of the H bandpass spectra
are very different from those of field dwarfs with similar water absorption
strength, demonstrating that they are not foreground or background objects. In
addition, the CO absorption bands at 2.3 um and the NaI absorption feature at
2.21 um are very weak for such cool sources. All these features are quite well
reproduced by the AMES-Dusty-1999 model atmospheres of Allard et
al.(2000,2001), and arise from the low gravities predicted for the Trapezium

(astro-ph/0010616) was proposed to resolve problems of the CDM model on small
scales by keeping attractive features of both SIDM and annihilating dark
matter, and simultaneously avoid their drawbacks. A dark particle produced in a
flavor eigenstate will separate into two mass eigenstates because they
propagate with different velocities and, in a gravitational filed, along
different geodesics, see Fig. 1. Thus, in the flavor-mixed SIDM, dark halos are
made of heavy eigenstates, whereas light eigenstates may leave the halo.
Collisions (elastic scattering) of mass states results in eigenstate
conversion, see Fig. 2, which leads to the gradual decrease of the halo mass in
high-density cusps. On the other hand, in the early Universe, one may expect a
problem of over-production of light (hot) particles over heavy (cold) when the
temperature of dark matter falls below the mass of the heavy component. We show
how this problem is avoided.

masses, we have undertaken a high resolution (~0.05 arcsec) astrometric study.
Images were obtained over 1.5 years with bispectrum speckle interferometry at
the 6.5m MMT and 6m SAO telescopes. Our data show motion corresponding to more
than half the orbital period, and constrain the total mass to be > 0.115
M_solar, with a most probable value of 0.145 M_solar. Higher masses cannot be
excluded without more extended observations, but from statistical analysis we
find an 80% probability that the total mass is less than 0.21 M_solar.
  An infrared spectrum of the blended B double obtained with the MMT has been
modeled as a blend of two different spectral types, chosen to be consistent
with the measured J and K band brightness difference of a factor ~2. The
blended fit is not nearly as good as that to a pure M8.5+ template. Therefore
we hypothesize that the brighter component likely has two unresolved components
with near equal masses, each the same as the fainter component.
  If Gl 569B is a triple our dynamical limits suggest each component has a mass
of 50 (+23/-4) M_jupiter. We infer an age for the system of 300 Myr, from its
kinematic motion which places its as a member of the Ursa Major moving group.
All the above parameters are consistent with the latest DUSTY evolutiuon models

interpreted as a reflection of ellipsoidal collapse (as opposed to spherical
collapse assumed in the Press-Schechter formalism). We show that the average
mass accretion histories follow a simple, universal profile, and we present a
recipe for computing the two scale-parameters which is applicable to a wide
range of halo masses and cosmologies. Together with the universal profiles for
the density and angular momentum distributions of CDM haloes, these universal
mass accretion histories provide a simple but accurate framework for modeling
the structure and formation of dark matter haloes. In particular, they can be
used as a backbone for modeling various aspects of galaxy formation where one
is not interested in the detailed effects of merging. As an example we use the
universal mass accretion history to compute the rate at which haloes accrete

accelerated in the shock via the first order Fermi process, are supposed to
cool by inverse Compton process on external soft photons, resulting in a
cut-off power law shape of the particle distribution function. The high energy
photons produced are thus able to create pairs, through photon-photon
annihilation. The increase of the pair pressure may then be sufficient to
modify the shock profile. We show that there is even a limit of the pair
pressure (of the order of 20% of the ram pressure of the upstream flow) above
which the shock cannot exist any longer. Conversely, significant changes of the
flow velocity profile will also modify the spectral index and the high energy
cut--off of the particle distribution function. Hence the number of particles
able to trigger the pair creation process will change, modifying the pair
creation rate accordingly. Taking into account these different processes, we
self-consistently derive the flow velocity profile and the particle
distribution function. We show that, in some region of the parameter space, the
system can converge towards stationary states where pair creation and
hydrodynamical effects balance. We discuss the application of this model to
explain the high energy emission observed in compact objects. We show that hard
X-ray spectra ($\alpha_{X}< 1.$) are only obtained for small pair pressure and
we don't expect any strong annihilation line in this case. We suggest also a
possible variability mechanism if the soft photon compactness depends itself on
the pair density of the hot plasma, such as expected in reillumination models.

associated with supernovae but also have small baryon contamination. In this
model, we assume a newborn neutron star to move outward at a kick velocity of
$\sim 10^3 {\rm km} {\rm s}^{-1}$ in the supernova ejecta. We find that such a
neutron star still hypercritically accretes its surrounding supernova matter.
Once the stellar mass increases to some critical mass, the neutron star will
undergo a phase transition to become a strange star, leading to an energy
release of a few $10^{52}$ ergs. The phase transition, if possibly occuring
just near the supernova front, will first result in an ultra-relativistic
fireball and then a GRB. This provides a plausible explanation for the
GRB-supernova association. We estimate the burst rate to be $\sim 10^{-6}$ per
year per galaxy. Our model also predicts other possiblities. For example, if
the resulting fireballs have a Lorentz factor of the order of a few, they will
produce X-ray GRBs observed by BeppoSAX. We find the rate of such bursts to be

R=17200, 8600, 4300 and 2150. We have investigated late-F to early-M stars
(constituting the vast majority of GAIA targets), slowly rotating (V_{rot} sin
i = 4 km/sec, as for field stars at these spectral types), of solar metallicity
(<[Fe/H]> = -0.07) and not binary. The results are accurately described by the
simple law: lg sigma = 0.6(lg S/N)^2 - 2.4(lg S/N) + 1.75(lg D) + 3, where
sigma is the cross-correlation standard error (in km/sec) and D is the spectral
dispersion (in Ang/pix). The spectral dispersion has turned out to be the
dominant factor governing the accuracy of radial velocities, with S/N being
less important and the spectral mis-match being a weak player. These results
are relevant not only within the GAIA context but also to ground-based
observers because the absence of telluric absorptions and proximity to the
wavelengths of peak emission make the explored 8490--8740 Ang interval an
interesting option for studies of cool stars with conventional telescopes.

from the orbital angular momentum of merging satellites, and another in which
halo spin is gained via tidal torquing on shells of material while still in the
linear regime. We find that both scenarios produce the characteristic spin
distribution of halos found in N-body simulations, namely, a log-normal
distribution with mean ~0.04 and standard deviation ~0.5 in the log. A perfect
match requires fine-tuning of two free parameters. Both algorithms also
reproduce the general insensitivity of the spin distribution to halo mass,
redshift and cosmology seen in N-body simulations. The spin distribution can be
made strictly constant by physically motivated scalings of the free parameters.
In addition, both schemes predict that halos which have had recent major
mergers have systematically larger spin values. These algorithms can be
implemented within semi-analytic models of galaxy formation based on merger
trees. They yield detailed predictions of galaxy properties that strongly
depend on angular momentum (such as size and surface brightness) as a function
of merger history and environment.

affected by the presence of a strong magnetic field, we study torsional modes
in magnetized relativistic stars. We derive the linearized perturbation
equations that govern torsional oscillations coupled to the oscillations of a
magnetic field, when variations in the metric are neglected (Cowling
approximation). The oscillations are described by a single two-dimensional wave
equation, which can be solved as a boundary value problem to obtain
eigenfrequencies. We find that in the non-magnetized case, typical oscillation
periods of the fundamental l=2 torsional modes can be nearly a factor of two
larger for relativistic stars than previously computed in the Newtonian limit.
For magnetized stars, we show that the influence of the magnetic field is
highly dependent on the assumed magnetic field configuration and simple
estimates obtained previously in the literature cannot be used for identifying
normal modes observationally.

transport, the statistical conservation laws are hidden in the evolution of
groups of fluid particles and arise from the competition between the expansion

break a bond is independent of the surface orientation. This novel finding can
lead to the development of simple models to describe the energetics of a
surface like step and kink formation, crystal growth, alloy formation,
equilibrium shape of mesoscopic crystallites and surface faceting.

approaches to the first question, which demonstrate the key role played by the

folding dynamics of proteins remains a challenging problem -- a detailed

with the solvent is a daunting task. We address this issue building on the
lessons learned in tackling the first question and apply the resulting method
to the folding of various proteins including HIV protease and membrane
proteins. The results that will be presented open a fascinating perspective:
the two questions appear to be intimately related. The variety of results
reported here all provide evidence in favour of the special criteria adopted by

  ""Fundamental Physics in Space"", Warsaw (July 2000)",,,"LPTENS-01/25","hep-ph",,"  We discuss the possible existence of new long-range forces mediated by spin-1
or spin-0 particles. They would add their effects to those of gravity, and
could lead to apparent violations of the Equivalence Principle. Informations on
the (vector and axial) couplings of a new spin-1 U boson may be obtained from
spontaneously broken gauge invariance. The charge associated with the vector
coupling may be expressed as a linear combination of B and L. If the new force
has a finite range lambda, its intensity turns out to be proportional to
1/(lambda^2 F^2), F being the extra U(1) symmetry-breaking scale.
  Quite surprisingly, particle physics experiments can provide constraints on
such a force, even if the corresponding gauge coupling is extremely small (<<
10^-19 !). An ""equivalence theorem"" shows that a very light spin-1 U boson with
non-vanishing axial couplings does not in general decouple even when its gauge
coupling vanishes, but behaves as a quasimassless pseudoscalar. (This
equivalence theorem is similar to the one of supersymmetry/supergravity
theories, according to which a very light spin-3/2 gravitino might get
detectable as a quasi massless spin-1/2 goldstino, despite the extreme
smallness of Newton's gravitational constant G_N.) Searches for the radiative
production of such U bosons in psi and upsilon decays restrict the extra U(1)
symmetry-breaking scale F to be larger than the electroweak scale, providing
constraints on the intensity of the corresponding new force.

introduced at the excision surface between the interior and exterior geometries

localized regular quotient ring spectra over a commutative S-algebra R in the
sense of Elmendorf, Kriz, Mandell, May and Strickland. The formulation of this
spectral sequence is similar to the classical case and the calculation of its
E_2-term involves the cohomology of certain `brave new Hopf algebroids' E^R_*E.
In working out the details we resurrect Adams' original approach to Universal
Coefficient Spectral Sequences for modules over an R ring spectrum.
  We show that the Adams Spectral Sequence for S_R based on a commutative
localized regular quotient R ring spectrum E=R/I[X^{-1}] converges to the
homotopy of the E-nilpotent completion pi_*hat{L}^R_ES_R=R_*[X^{-1}]^hat_{I_*}.
We also show that when the generating regular sequence of I_* is finite,
hatL^R_ES_R is equivalent to L^R_ES_R, the Bousfield localization of S_R with
respect to E-theory. The spectral sequence here collapses at its E_2-term but
it does not have a vanishing line because of the presence of polynomial
generators of positive cohomological degree. Thus only one of Bousfield's two
standard convergence criteria applies here even though we have this
equivalence. The details involve the construction of an I-adic tower R/I <--
R/I^2 <-- ... <-- R/I^s <-- R/I^{s+1} <-- ... whose homotopy limit is
hatL^R_ES_R. We describe some examples for the motivating case R=MU.

stable kink solution. A nontrivial situation takes places when PD is itself
subject to a kink-like spatial modulation, so that it selects real and
imaginary constant solutions at +infinity and -infinity. In this situation, we
find stationary solutions numerically, and also analytically for a particular
case. They seem to be of two different types, viz., a pair of kinks in the real
and imaginary components, or the same with an extra kink inserted into each
component, but we show that both belong to a single continuous family of
solutions. The family is parametrized by the coordinate of a point at which the
extra kinks are inserted. Solutions with more than one kink inserted into each
component do not exist. Simulations show that the former solution is always
stable, and the latter one is, in a certain sense, neutrally stable, as there
is a special type of small perturbations that remain virtually constant in
time, rather than decaying or growing (they eventually decay, but extremely
slowly).

renormalization-group methods. The renormalization transformation acting on a
Hamiltonian is a canonical change of coordinates which is a combination of a
partial elimination of the irrelevant modes of the Hamiltonian and a rescaling
of phase space around the considered torus. We give numerical evidence that the
critical coupling at which the renormalization transformation starts to diverge
is the same as the value given by the frequency map analysis for the break-up
of invariant tori. Furthermore, we obtain by these methods numerical values of
the threshold of the break-up of the last invariant torus.

determined by its time-of-flight (TOF) from the source to the detector. The
achievable precision is ultimately limited by the non-zero emission time-width
of the source/moderator system. Particularly, coupled moderators that are used
to produce high intensity cold neutron beams show long ""tails"" in the
intensity/time distribution for all wavelengths. For this reason much less
intense decoupled moderators are often used for instruments that require high
resolution. We present here a novel technique for dynamic energy filtering of
thermal and cold polarized neutron beams. The device consists of a
polarizer/analyzer system and an energy-selective spin-resonance flipper. By
drifting its resonance condition in synchronization with the TOF, the filter
controls the energy resolution of a broad bandwidth TOF neutron pulse.

ultrasensitive two-photon switching.

show that the energy spectrum of the associated Lam\'{e} potentials
$$a(a+1)m~{\rm sn}^2(x,m)+b(b+1)m~{\rm cn}^2(x,m)/{\rm dn}^2(x,m)$$ consists of
a finite number of bound bands followed by a continuum band when both $a$ and
$b$ take integer values. Further, if $a$ and $b$ are unequal integers, we show
that there must exist some zero band-gap states, i.e. doubly degenerate states
with the same number of nodes. More generally, in case $a$ and $b$ are not
integers, but either $a + b$ or $a - b$ is an integer ($a \ne b$), we again
show that several of the band-gaps vanish due to degeneracy of states with the
same number of nodes. Finally, when either $a$ or $b$ is an integer and the
other takes a half-integral value, we obtain exact analytic solutions for
several mid-band states.
