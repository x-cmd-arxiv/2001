the largest compilation available of starlight data. The data comprises ~ 9300
stars of which we have selected ~ 5500 for our analysis. We find a nearly
linear growth of mean polarization degree with extinction. The amplitude of
this correlation shows that interstellar grains are not fully aligned with the
Galactic magnetic field, which can be interpreted as the effect of a large
random component of the field. In agreement with earlier studies of more
limited scope, we estimate the ratio of the uniform to the random
plane-of-the-sky components of the magnetic field to be B_u/B_r = 0.8.
Moreover, a clear correlation exists between polarization degree and
polarization angle what provides evidence that the magnetic field geometry
follows Galactic structures on large-scales. The angular power spectrum C_l of
the starlight polarization degree for Galactic plane data (|b| < 10 deg) is
consistent with a power-law, C_l ~ l^{-1.5} (where l ~ 180 deg/\theta is the
multipole order), for all angular scales \theta > 10 arcmin. An investigation
of sparse and inhomogeneous sampling of the data shows that the starlight data
analyzed traces an underlying polarized continuum that has the same power
spectrum slope, C_l ~ l^{-1.5}. Our findings suggest that starlight data can be
safely used for the modeling of Galactic polarized continuum emission at other
wavelengths.

the equivalent width distribution at z~0, then there is at least a 25%

These systems have strong FeII absorption and are good candidates for damped

translates to a redshift number density of dN/dz=0.08(+0.09)(-0.05) for DLAs at

that the redshift number density of DLAs does not evolve from z~4 to z~0. If
the HI mass function does not evolve from z~0.5 to z~0, then the cosmological
HI mass density is also deduced to not evolve from z~4 to z~0. These z~0

corresponding to the WIMP mass, comes from the asymmetric distortion of the
line due to WIMP annihilation into two gamma-rays caused by the cosmological
redshift. Unlike other proposed searches for a line signal, this method is not
very sensitive to the exact dark matter density distribution in halos and
subhalos. The only requirement is that the mass distribution of substructure on
small scales follows approximately the Press-Schechter law, and that smaller
halos are on the average denser than large halos, which is a generic outcome of
N-body simulations of Cold Dark Matter, and which has observational support.
The upcoming Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) will be eminently

$\Omega/\Omega_{\mathrm{crit}}$ of the angular velocity to the break-up angular
velocity grow strongly during the evolution of high mass stars, contrary to the
situation at $Z$ = 0.020. The reason is that at low $Z$, mass loss is smaller
and the removal of angular momentum during evolution much weaker, also there is
an efficient outward transport of angular momentum by meridional circulation.
Thus, a much larger fraction of the stars at lower $Z$ reach break-up
velocities and rotation may thus be a dominant effect at low $Z$. The models
with rotation well account for the long standing problem of the large numbers
of red supergiants observed in low $Z$ galaxies, while current models with mass
loss were predicting no red supergiants. We discuss in detail the physical
effects of rotation which favour a redwards evolution in the HR diagram. The
models also predict large N enrichments during the evolution of high mass
stars. The predicted relative N-enrichments are larger at $Z$ lower than solar
and this is in very good agreement with the observations for A-type supergiants

temperature by successive avalanches in a creep motion with a macroscopic

range. The retreat motion is obtained only at much lower temperature,
conforming to the strong hysteresis observed for prewetting transition on a

to give rise to dynamical phenomena similar to what is observed for domain wall

learning rules have focussed on asymptotic stability and efficiency. In

analysis of a Hebbian ICA algorithm which can find a small number of
non-Gaussian components given data composed of a linear mixture of independent
source signals. An idealised data model is considered in which the sources
comprise a number of non-Gaussian and Gaussian sources and a solution to the

infinite. Previous stability results are confirmed by expanding around optimal
fixed points, where a closed form solution to the learning dynamics is
obtained. However, stochastic effects are shown to stabilise otherwise unstable
sub-optimal fixed points. Conditions required to destabilise one such fixed
point are obtained for the case of a single non-Gaussian component, indicating
that the initial learning rate \eta required to successfully escape is very low

  P. Hsu and P. Zhang (World Scientific, to be published)",,,,"hep-ph hep-th math-ph math.MP nucl-th quant-ph",,"  R. P. Feynman was quite fond of inventing new physics. It is shown that some
of his physical ideas can be supported by the mathematical instruments
available from the Lorentz group. As a consequence, it is possible to construct
a Lorentz-covariant picture of the parton model. It is shown first how the
Lorentz group can be used for studying the internal space-time symmetries of
relativistic particles. These symmetries are dictated by Wigner's little
groups, whose transformations leave the energy-momentum four-vector of a given
particle invariant. The symmetry of massive particles is like the
three-dimensional rotation group, while the symmetry of massless particles is
locally isomorphic to the two-dimensional Euclidean group. It is noted that the
E(2)-like symmetry of massless particles can be obtained as an
infinite-momentum and/or zero-mass limit of the O(3)-like little group for
massive particles. It is shown that the formalism can be extended to cover
relativistic particles with space-time extensions, such as heavy ions and
hadrons in the quark model. It is possible to construct representations of the
little group using harmonic oscillators, which Feynman et al. used for studying
relativistic extended hadrons. This oscillator formalism allows us to show that
Feynman's parton model is a Lorentz-boosted quark model. The formalism also
allows us to explain in detail Feynman's rest of the universe which is
contained in his parton picture.

shown that the steep rise of the baryon-number susceptibility $\chi_B$ around
the critical point seen in the lattice simulations may suggest that the
interactions between quarks in the vector channel become week near the critical

These are flux p-branes which have (p+1)-dimensional Poincare invariance and
are associated to an electric (p+1)-form field strength along their
worldvolume. When a stack of Dp-branes is placed along the worldvolume of a
flux (p+3)-brane it will expand to a spherical D(p+2)-brane due to the
dielectric effect. This provides a new setup to consider the gauge
theory/gravity duality. Compactifying M-theory on a circle we find the exact
gravity solution of the type IIA theory describing the dielectric expansion of
N D4-branes into a spherical bound state of D4-D6-branes, due to the presence
of a flux 7-brane. In the decoupling limit, the deformation of the dual field
theory associated with the presence of the flux brane is irrelevant in the UV.
We calculate the gravitational radius and energy of the dielectric brane which
give, respectively, a prediction for the VEV of scalars and vacuum energy of
the dual field theory. Consideration of a spherical D6-brane probe with n units
of D4-brane charge in the dielectric brane geometry suggests that the dual
theory arises as the Scherk-Schwarz reduction of the M5-branes (2,0) conformal
field theory. The probe potential has one minimum placed at the locus of the
bulk dielectric brane and another associated to an inner dielectric brane
shell.

quadratic in the momenta. However, it is possible to add a boundary term to the
original action to build a fully gauge-invariant action at first order. In
addition, two relatives of string theory whose actions are fully
gauge-invariant under the gauge symmetry involved when the spatial slice is
closed are built. The first one is pure diffeomorphism in the sense it has no
Hamiltonian constraint and thus bosonic string theory becomes a sub-sector of
its space of solutions. The second one is associated with the tensionless

the subset of the classical energy surface $\{H=E\}$ which stays bounded for
all time under the flow generated by the Hamiltonian $H$ and $D(K_E)$ denotes
its fractal dimension. Since the number of bound states in a quantum system
with $n$ degrees of freedom scales like $\hbar^{-n}$, this suggests that the
quantity $\frac{D(K_E)+1}{2}$ represents the effective number of degrees of

ability to evolve in time, creating and suppressing interactions. We approach
this issue within the framework of an adaptive network of agents playing a
Prisoner's Dilemma game, where each agent plays with its local neighbors,
collects an aggregate payoff and imitates the strategy of its best neighbor. We
allow the agents to adapt their local neighborhood according to their
satisfaction level and the strategy played. We show that a steady state is
reached, where the strategy and network configurations remain stationary. While
the fraction of cooperative agents is high in these states, their average
payoff is lower than the one attained by the defectors. The system
self-organizes in such a way that the structure of links in the network is
quite inhomogeneous, revealing the occurrence of cooperator ``leaders'' with a
very high connectivity, which guarantee that global cooperation can be
sustained in the whole network. Perturbing the leaders produces drastic changes
of the network, leading to global dynamical cascades. These cascades induce a
transient oscillation in the population of agents between the nearly
all-defectors state and the all-cooperators outcome, before setting again in a
state of high global cooperation.

very interesting for a theoretical as well as an experimental point of view. In
this region one can apply different physical methods, starting from classical
current algebra methods - for processes invloving soft pions, through effective
Lagrangian approaches - or perturbative chiral symmetry theory (ChPT). The
essential simplification of the spin structure of matrix elements for threshold
regime results in better understanding of the underlying mechanisms and allows
the analysis of polarization phenomena. A dedicated formalism is developed here
for a wide class of processes including even such complicated processes as
production of pseudoscalar and vector mesons in nucleon-nucleon collisions.
Many interesting physical problems are discussed: hidden strangeness of
nucleons and OZI-violation, $\eta N$ -and $\omega N$ interactions in S-state,
the determination of P-parity of strange particles. Special attention is
devoted to the analysis of the spin structure and polarization phenomena for
nuclear processes with light nuclei which have important applications in
fundamental astrophysics and in nuclear fusion.

This is shown to lead to a highly nontrivial generalization of the result for
two-level systems in which degeneracy results in a ""monopole"" structure in
parameter space. The rich structures that arise are related to the geometry of
adjoint orbits in SU(3). The limiting case of a two-level degeneracy in a

employing the notion of electron-positron pair production in which the number
of electrons present in a process can increase. The Klein paradox also exists
in Maxwell's equations viewed as the wave equation for photons. In a medium
containing ``inverted energy populations'' of excited atoms, e.g. in a LASER
medium, one may again compute possible ``negative probabilities''. The
resolution of the electromagnetic Klein paradox is that when the atoms decay,
the final state may contain more photons then were contained the initial state.
The optical theorem total cross section for scattering photons from excited
