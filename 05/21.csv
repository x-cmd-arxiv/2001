  Harwit and Michael G. Hauser eds",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The extragalactic background light (EBL), exclusive of the cosmic microwave
background, consists of the cumulative radiative output from all energy sources
in the universe since the epoch of recombination. Most of this energy is
released at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths. However, observations show
that a significant fraction of the EBL falls in the 10 to 1000 micron
wavelength regime. This provides conclusive evidence that we live in a dusty
universe, since only dust can efficiently absorbs a significant fraction of the
background energy and reemit it at infrared wavelengths. The general role of
dust in forming the cosmic infrared background (CIB) is therefore obvious.
However, its role in determining the exact spectral shape of the CIB is quite
complex. The CIB spectrum depends on the microscopic physical properties of the
dust, its composition, abundance, and spatial distribution relative to the
emitting sources, and its response to evolutionary processes that can modify
all the factors listed above. This paper will present a brief summary of the
many ways dust affects the intensity and spectral shape of the cosmic infrared
background. In an Appendix we present new limits on the mid-infrared intensity

recent improved experimental data on the spin wave spectrum of La_2CuO_4.
Starting from a conventional three-band model we determine the exchange
couplings for the nearest and next-nearest neighbor Heisenberg exchange as well
as for 4- and 6-spin exchange terms via a direct perturbation expansion up to
12th (14th for the 4-spin term) order with respect to the copper-oxygen hopping
t_pd. Our results demonstrate that this perturbation expansion does not
converge for hopping parameters of the relevant size. Well behaved
extrapolations of the couplings are derived, however, in terms of Pade
approximants. In order to check the significance of these results from the
direct perturbation expansion we employ the Zhang-Rice reformulation of the
three band model in terms of hybridizing oxygen Wannier orbitals centered at
copper ion sites. In the Wannier notation the perturbation expansion is
reorganized by an exact treatment of the strong site-diagonal hybridization.
The perturbation expansion with respect to the weak intersite hybridizations is
calculated up to 4th order for the Heisenberg coupling and up to 6th order for
the 4-spin coupling. It shows excellent convergence and the results are in
agreement with the Pade approximants of the direct expansion. The relevance of
the 4-spin coupling as the leading correction to the nearest neighbor
Heisenberg model is emphasized.

This system shows rather different glass transition scenarios related to its
rich equilibrium behavior which ranges from a simple hard sphere fluid to a
long range ferroelectric orientational order. In the liquid phase close to the
ideal glass transition line and in the glassy regime a medium range
orientational order occurs leading to a softening of an orientational mode. To
investigate the role of this mode we use the molecular mode-coupling equations
to calculate the spectra $\phi_{lm}^{\prime \prime}(q,\omega)$ and $\chi

$\chi_{00}''(q,\omega)$ we found besides a high frequency peak at $\omega

the existence of this peak is related to the occurrence of the medium ranged

from the fact that the reference states for the two components have different
partial temperatures, leading to additional dependencies of the transport
coefficients on the concentration. The results hold for arbitrary degree of
inelasticity and are not limited to specific values of the parameters of the
mixture. Applications of this theory will be discussed in subsequent papers.

weak radiative hyperon decays in the VMD approach, and the violation of Hara's
theorem in particular, are also obtained when direct coupling e_q
\bar{q}\gamma_{\mu}q A^{\mu} of photon to quarks is used in place of VMD. Thus,
violation of Hara's theorem in VMD-based models does not result from the lack
of gauge invariance. It is further shown that, in the static limit of the quark
model, the CA commutator term in the p.v. amplitudes of nonleptonic hyperon
decays (NLHD) and the parity-violating \Sigma ^+ \to p \gamma decay amplitude
are proportional to each other. As a result, Hara's theorem may be satisfied in
this limit if and only if the contribution from the CA commutator in NLHD is
zero. Violation of Hara's theorem is traced back to the nonlocality of quark
model states in the static limit. It is argued that the ensuing intrinsic
baryon nonlocality does not have to be unphysical. It is stressed that the \Xi
^0 \to \Lambda \gamma asymmetry will provide very important information
concerning the presence or absence of nonlocal features in p.v. photon coupling
to baryons at vanishing photon momentum. If the \Xi ^0 \to \Lambda \gamma
asymmetry is found negative, Hara's theorem is satisfied but the
gauge-invariant quark model machinery predicting its violation must miss some
contribution, or be modified. If experiment confirms positive \Xi ^0 \to
\Lambda \gamma asymmetry, then, most likely, Hara's theorem is violated.
Although positive \Xi ^0 \to \Lambda \gamma asymmetry admits of the possibility
that Hara's theorem is satisfied, this alternative is in disagreement with
hints suggested by the similarity of photon and vector-meson couplings and the
observed size of p.v. nuclear forces.

that, in the lepton mixing matrix U, maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing
together with U_{e3}=0 can be obtained naturally. Alternatively, if one assumes
that there are two different scales in M_R and that the lepton number \bar L =
L_e - L_\mu - L_\tau is conserved in between them, then maximal solar neutrino
mixing follows naturally. If both the discrete symmetry and intermediate \bar L
conservation are introduced, bimaximal mixing is achieved.

Supersymmetry is broken spontaneously by a Fayet-Iliopoulos D-term which
naturally arises in a noncommutative U(n) theory. For a non-chiral matter
content the Fayet-Iliopoulos term is not renormalized and its tree-level value
can be chosen to be much smaller than the relevant string/noncommutativity
scale. In the low energy theory, the noncommutative U(n) gauge symmetry is
broken down to a commutative U(1) x SU(n). This breaking is triggered by the
IR/UV mixing and manifests itself at and below the noncommutativity mass scale
M_{NC}\sim \theta^{-1/2}. In particular, the U(1) degrees of freedom decouple
from the SU(n) in the infrared and become arbitrarily weakly coupled, thus
playing the role of the hidden sector for supersymmetry breaking.

self-consistent mean-field calculations, for spherical as well as for deformed
nuclei. For these nuclei, the respective merits of the energy differences
$\Delta^{(3)}$ and $\Delta^{(5)}$ to extract both the pairing gap and the
time-reversal symmetry breaking effect at the same time are extensively
discussed. The usual mass formula $\Delta^{(3)}$, is shown to contain
additional mean-field contributions when realistic pairing is used in the
calculation. A simple tool is proposed in order to remove time-reversal
symmetry breaking effects from $\Delta^{(5)}$. Extended comparisons with the
odd-even mass staggering obtained in the zero pairing limit (schematic model
and self-consistent calculations) show the non-perturbative contribution of
pairing correlations on this observable.

3 nuclei at large values of the Bjorken variable x is presented. The main
purpose is to estimate the theoretical uncertainties on the extraction of the
neutron DIS structure function from such nuclear measurements. On one hand,
within models in which no modification of the bound nucleon structure functions
is taken into account, we have investigated the possible uncertainties arising
from: i) charge symmetry breaking terms in the nucleon-nucleon interaction, ii)
finite Q**2 effects neglected in the Bjorken limit, iii) the role of different
prescriptions for the nucleon Spectral Function normalization providing baryon
number conservation, and iv) the differences between the virtual nucleon and
light cone formalisms. Although these effects have been not yet considered in
existing analyses, our conclusion is that all these effects cancel at the level
of ~ 1% for x < 0.75 in overall agreement with previous findings. On the other
hand we have considered several models in which the modification of the bound
nucleon structure functions is accounted for to describe the EMC effect in DIS
scattering from nuclei. It turns out that within these models the cancellation
of nuclear effects is expected to occur only at a level of ~ 3%, leading to an
accuracy of ~ 12 % in the extraction of the neutron to proton structure
function ratio at x ~ 0.7 -0.8$. Another consequence of considering a broad
range of models of the EMC effect is that the previously suggested iteration
procedure does not improve the accuracy of the extraction of the neutron to
proton structure function ratio.

(Kaivarainen, 2001, 2000, 1995, 1992), has been briefly described and
illustrated by computer simulations on examples of water and ice. Full
description of theory and its numerous applications are presented in series of
articles at the arXiv of Los-Alamos (see http://arXiv.org/abs/physics/0102086).
New clusterphilic interactions, intermediate between hydrophilic and
hydrphobic, are introduced. They can be subdivided into: intramolecular - when
water cluster is localized in the ''open'' states of big interdomain or
intersubunit cavities and intermolecular clusterphilic interactions.
Intermolecular clusterphilic interactions can be induced by very different
macromolecules. The latter displays themselves in bordering of water cluster by
macromolecules and forming so-called ''clustrons''. Clusterphilic interactions
can play an important role in self-organization of biosystems, especially
multiglobular allosteric enzymes, microtubules and the actin filaments. The
selected review of literature, devoted to antifreeze proteins (AFP) and
ice-nucleation proteins (INP) interaction with water is presented.
Corresponding experimental results were analyzed on the base of Hierarchic
theory. The possible mechanism of cryoproteins influence on water, changing its
freezing point has been proposed. The consequences of new model of AFP action
and ways of its experimental verification are described also.

sustaining the field. The unification problem is then reduced to the problem of

by extending Doppler cooling to forbidden transitions. A cloud of ^40Ca atoms
has been cooled and trapped to a temperature as low as 6 \mu K by operating a
magneto-optical trap on the spin-forbidden intercombination transition.
Quenching the long-lived excited state with an additional laser enhanced the
scattering rate by a factor of 15, while a high selectivity in velocity was
preserved. With this method more than 10% of pre-cooled atoms from a standard
magneto-optical trap have been transferred to the ultracold trap. Monte-Carlo
simulations of the cooling process are in good agreement with the experiments.
