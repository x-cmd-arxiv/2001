  systems","8 pages, 3 figures, accepted by A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20010690",,"astro-ph",,"  We present adaptive optics JHKs imaging observations of three main-sequence
late B-type stars listed in the Lindroos Catalogue: HD123445, HD127971 and
HD129791. Given their spectral types, these stars should not be X-ray emitters.
However, they have been detected by ROSAT and their X-ray emission has been
attributed to possible unresolved late-type companions. We have carried out
near-IR observations with ADONIS at the ESO 3.6m but have not detected any
late-type companions close to HD127971 and HD129791. This result leads us to
conclude that either (i) they are spectroscopic binaries with unresolved
low-mass companions, or (ii) they are intrinsic X-ray emitters. While the
former case would be consistent with the reported high multiplicity of
early-type (A and B) stars, the latter would yield a revision of stellar
activity theories which do not predict X-ray emission from these stars. On the
other hand, HD123445 does indeed show visual companions, namely an apparent
subarcsecond faint (Ks=10mag) binary system at a projected separation of 5""
from the late-B type star. The JHKs magnitudes and colors of the components are
consistent with a pair of Pre Main Sequence (PMS) K-type stars at 140 pc, i.e.
possible members of the Upper Centaurus Lupus association. In this case the
reported X-ray emission can be ascribed to the new binary system. Nevertheless,
spectroscopy is required to confirm the possible PMS nature of the pair.

observed in the solar convection zone, without requiring separate physical
mechanisms with different time scales at different depths.

of adsorption of noble gases on the surface of carbon nanotubes. We find
analytical results for the possible magnetization plateau values as a function
of the wrapping vectors of the cylinder, which in general introduce extra
geometric frustration besides the one due to the underlying triangular lattice.
We show that for particular wrapping vectors $(N,0)$, which correspond to the
zig-zag nanotubes, there is a macroscopically degenerate ground state in the
classical Ising limit. The Hilbert space for the degenerate states can be
enumerated by a mapping first into a path in a square lattice wrapped around a
cylinder (a Bratteli diagram), and then to free fermions interacting with a
single ${\bf Z}_N$ degree of freedom. From this model we obtain the spectrum in
the anisotropic Heisenberg limit, showing that it is gapless. The continuum
limit is a $c=1$ conformal field theory with compactification radius $R=N$ set
by the physical tube radius. We show that the compactification radius
quantization is exact in the projective $J_\perp/J_z \ll 1$ limit, and that
higher order corrections reduce the value of $R$. The particular case of a
$(N=2,0)$ tube, which corresponds to a 2-leg ladder with cross links, is

referred to as in--out intermittency, in both PDE and ODE models of mean field
dynamos. This type of intermittency (introduced in Ashwin et al 1999) occurs in
systems with invariant submanifolds and, as opposed to on--off intermittency
which can also occur in skew product systems, it requires an absence of skew
product structure. By this we mean that the dynamics on the attractor
intermittent to the invariant manifold cannot be expressed simply as the
dynamics on the invariant subspace forcing the transverse dynamics; the
transverse dynamics will alter that tangential to the invariant subspace when
one is far enough away from the invariant manifold.
  Since general systems with invariant submanifolds are not likely to have skew
product structure, this type of behaviour may be of physical relevance in a
variety of dynamical settings.
  The models employed here to demonstrate in--out intermittency are
axisymmetric mean--field dynamo models which are often used to study the
observed large scale magnetic variability in the Sun and solar-type stars. The
occurrence of this type of intermittency in such models may be of interest in

to on-off in systems with a skew product structure, has been found in the

in the form of trajectories that spend a long time near a symmetric state
interspersed with short bursts away from symmetry. In contrast to on-off
intermittency, there are clearly distinct mechanisms of approach towards and
away from the symmetric state, and this needs to be taken into account in order
to properly model the long time statistics. We do this by using a
diffusion-type equation with delay integral boundary condition. This model is
validated by considering the statistics of a two-dimensional map with and
