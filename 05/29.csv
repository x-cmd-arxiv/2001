'peculiar' Type Ia supernova 1999by in NGC 2841. The observations began one
week before visual maximum light which is well-defined by daily observations.
The light curves and spectra are similar to those of the prototypical
subluminous event SN 1991bg. We find that maximum light in B occurred on 1999
May 10.3 UT (JD 2,451,308.8 +/- 0.3) with B=13.66 +/- 0.02 mag and a color of
B_max-V_max=0.51 +/- 0.03 mag. The late-time color implies minimal dust
extinction from the host galaxy. Our photometry, when combined with the recent
Cepheid distance to NGC 2841 (Macri et al. 2001), gives a peak absolute
magnitude of M_B=-17.15 +/- 0.23 mag, making SN 1999by one of the least
luminous Type Ia events ever observed. We estimate a decline rate parameter of
dm15(B)=1.90 mag, versus 1.93 for SN 1991bg, where 1.10 is typical for
so-called 'normal' events. We compare SN 1999by with other subluminous events
and find that the B_max-V_max color correlates strongly with the decline rate
and may be a more sensitive indicator of luminosity than the fading rate for
these objects. We find a good correlation between luminosity and the depth of
the spectral feature at 580 nm, which had been attributed solely to Si II. We
show that in cooler photospheres the 580 nm feature is dominated by Ti II,
which provides a simple physical explanation for the correlation. Using only
subluminous Type Ia supernovae we derive a Hubble parameter of H_0=75 +12 -11
km/s Mpc, consistent with values found from brighter events.

effects will strongly vary with redshift. Using a simple idealized survey
geometry, we compute the smoothed correlation matrix of the redshift-space
correlation function, and the Fisher matrix for $\omm$ and $\oml$. These
represent the best possible measurement of these parameters given the geometry.
We find that the likelihood contours are turning, according to the behavior of
the angular-diameter distance relation. The clustering measures from redshift
surveys at intermediate-to-high redshifts can provide a surprisingly tight
constraint on $\oml$. We also estimate confidence contours for real survey
geometries, using the SDSS LRG and QSO surveys as specific examples. We believe
that this method will become a practical tool to constrain the nature of the

based on a helium content Ysim0.28 inferred from the dydz enrichment law are
more than 3sigma beyond the observations, suggesting that the initial helium
abundance is lower than expected from its supersolar metallicity. With the
photometric metallicity (FeH=0.144pm0.013 dex, Grenon (2000) we derive
Y=0.255\pm0.009. Because of the (Y,FeH) degeneracy in the M-L plane, the
uncertainty grows to Delta Y=0.013 if the metallicity from spectroscopy is
adopted (FeH=0.14pm0.05 dex, Cayrel de Strobel et al 1997). We use these
results to discuss the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram of the Hyades, in the
(Mv,B-V) plane, based on the very precise Hipparcos dynamical parallaxes.
Present models fit the tight observed sequence very well except at low
temperatures. In the low mass region of the HR diagram sensitive to the
mixing-length parameter (aMLT), the slope of the main sequence (MS) suggests
that aMLT could decrease from a solar (or even supersolar) value at higher mass
to subsolar values at low mass, which is also supported by the modeling of the
vB22 M-L relation. We find that the discrepancy at low temperatures (B-V\gtrsim
1.2) remains, even if an improved equation of state or better model atmospheres
are used. Finally, we discuss the positions of the stars at turn-off in the
light of their observed rotation rates and we deduce that the maximum age of
the Hyades predicted by the present models is sim650 Myr.

The method is based on the so-called ""minimum charge"" principle, recently
suggested by Elser. The electron density function $\rho$ is sought in the form
$\rho({\bf x})=|\psi({\bf x})|^2$, where $\psi$ is an $n{-component}$ real
function. The norm $\int|\psi({\bf x})|^2 d{\bf x}$ is minimized under the
constraint imposed by the measured data on the amplitudes of Fourier harmonics
of $\rho$. Compared to the straightforward implementation of the ""minimum
charge"" scheme, the method attenuates the Gibbs phenomenon and is also capable
of extrapolation of the diffraction data beyond the set of measured amplitudes.
The method is applicable to quasicrystals under the condition that the number
of components $n$ of the function $\psi$ is bigger than the dimensionality of
the ``atomic surface''. It is successfully tested on synthetic data for
Fibonacci chain and the octagonal tiling. In the latter case the reconstructed
density map shows the shape of the atomic surface, despite relatively low data
resolution.

(small size ratios) the resulting effective Hamiltonian of the one-component
fluid of big spheres, which consists of an infinite number of many-body
interactions, should be accurately approximated by truncating after the term
describing the effective pair interaction. Using a density functional treatment
developed originally for additive hard-sphere mixtures we determine the zero,
one, and two-body contribution to the effective Hamiltonian. We demonstrate
that even small degrees of positive or negative non-additivity have significant
effect on the shape of the depletion potential. The second virial coefficient
$B_2$, corresponding to the effective pair interaction between two big spheres,
is found to be a sensitive measure of the effects of non-additivity. The
variation of $B_2$ with the density of the small spheres shows significantly
different behavior for additive, slightly positive and slightly negative
non-additive mixtures. We discuss the possible repercussions of these results

measurements of $B_2$ might provide a means of determining the degree of
non-additivity in real colloidal mixtures.

The charge-image interaction cannot be treated perturbatively and the density

fundamental solutions of associated linear systems with spectral parameter in
terms of a pair of dressing (``scattering'') matrices give rise to a new set of
linear (quasi-Fredholm) integral equations equivalent to the symmetry reduced
Einstein equations. Unlike previously derived singular integral equations
constructed with the use of conserved (nonevolving) monodromy data on the
spectral plane for the fundamental solutions of associated linear systems, the
scalar kernels of the new equations include another kind of functional
parameters -- the evolving (``dynamical'') monodromy data for the scattering
matrices. For hyperbolic reductions, in the context of characteristic initial
value problem these data are determined completely by the characteristic
initial data for the fields. In terms of solutions of the new integral
equations the field components are expressed in quadratures.

dynamics is generated by a vector field inside the kernel of a presymplectic
form which is derived from the canonical left-invariant one-form on the

distributions are quite different from the final distributions due to
evaporation from the excited fragments, the values of a and b are not much
affected by sequential decays. a is shown to be mainly sensitive to the proton
and neutron composition of the emitting source and may be used to study
isospin-dependent properties in nuclear collisions such as the symmetry energy
in the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter.

and quantum gravity, respectively, as well as with self-organized criticality,
suffices to re-construct a large class of phenomena not only within the field
of physics proper, but also within chemistry, biology, and even the social
sciences. We show that questions of ultimate reality and meaning can only be
answered within a framework of speculative philosophy which is rooted though in
what sceptic philosophy is able to derive from scientific results.

divalent metals (Zn, Cd), and trivalent metals (Al, In), as well as to
theoretical predictions of jellium models, Woods-Saxon and wine bottle
potentials, and to the classification scheme using the 3n+l pseudo quantum

q-deformed harmonic oscillator correctly predicts all experimentally observed
magic numbers up to 1500 (which is the expected limit of validity for theories
based on the filling of electronic shells), while in addition it gives
satisfactory results for the magic numbers of clusters of divalent metals and
trivalent metals, thus indicating that Uq(3), which is a nonlinear extension of
the U(3) symmetry of the spherical (3-dimensional isotropic) harmonic
oscillator, is a good candidate for being the symmetry of systems of several
metal clusters. The Taylor expansions of angular momentum dependent potentials
approximately producing the same spectrum as the 3-dimensional q-deformed
harmonic oscillator are found to be similar to the Taylor expansions of the
symmetrized Woods-Saxon and wine-bottle symmetrized Woods-Saxon potentials,
which are known to provide successful fits of the Ekardt potentials.

the error probability in inferring the states, as well as with respect to
maximizing the probability of success for unambiguous discrimination. Moreover,
an implementation of error-minimizing discrimination between N symmetric

number of applications, the nonadiabatic transition of a Bose-Einstein
condensate between Bloch bands. Numerical analysis revealed a striking
phenomenon that tunneling occurs even in the adiabatic limit as the nonlinear
parameter $C$ is above a critical value equal to the gap $V$ of avoided
crossing of the two levels. In this paper, we present analytical results that
give quantitative account of the breakdown of adiabaticity by mapping this
quantum nonlinear model into a classical Josephson Hamiltonian. In the critical
region, we find a power-law scaling of the nonadiabatic transition probability
as a function of $C/V-1$ and $\alpha $, the crossing rate of the energy levels.
In the subcritical regime, the transition probability still follows an
exponential law but with the exponent changed by the nonlinear effect. For
$C/V>>1$, we find a near unit probability for the transition between the
adiabatic levels for all values of the crossing rate.

double well potential $V$ in one dimension. By starting from a trial function,
which is by itself the exact lowest even or odd eigenstate of a different
Hamiltonian with a modified potential $V+\delta V$, we construct the Green's
function for the modified potential. The true wave functions, $\psi_{ev}$ or
$\psi_{od}$, then satisfies a linear inhomogeneous integral equation, in which
the inhomogeneous term is the trial function, and the kernel is the product of
the Green's function times the sum of $\delta V$, the potential difference, and
the corresponding energy shift. By iterating this equation we obtain successive
approximations to the true wave function; furthermore, the approximate energy
shift is also adjusted at each iteration so that the approximate wave function
is well behaved everywhere. We are able to prove that this iterative procedure
converges for both the energy and the wave function at all $x$.

Their use in physics became popular with the introduction of the q-deformed
harmonic oscillator as a tool for providing a boson realization of the quantum
algebra SUq(2), although similar mathematical structures had already been
known. Initially used for solving the quantum Yang-Baxter equation, quantum
algebras have subsequently found applications in several branches of physics,
as, for example, in the description of spin chains, squeezed states, hydrogen
atom and hydrogen-like spectra, rotational and vibrational nuclear and
molecular spectra, and in conformal field theories. By now much work has been
done on the q-deformed oscillator and its relativistic extensions, and several
kinds of generalized deformed oscillators and SU(2) algebras have been
introduced. Here we shall confine ourselves to a list of applications of
quantum algebras in nuclear structure physics and in molecular physics and, in
addition, a recent application of quantum algebraic techniques to the structure
of atomic clusters will be discussed in more detail.
