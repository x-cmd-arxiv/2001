This allows us to calculate the temporal evolution of star and gas surface
densities at all galactic radii, in particular, the star formation history
(SFH) at the solar radius. A large range of cosmological mass aggregation
histories (MAHs) is capable of producing a galaxy with the present day
properties of the Milky Way. The resulting SFHs for the solar neighbourhood
bracket the available observational data for this feature, the most probable
MAH yielding the optimal comparison with these observations. We also find that
the rotation curve for our Galaxy implies the presence of a constant density
core in its dark matter halo.

range, arcsecond-resolution VLA radio maps of BL Lacs from the complete

previously available. Unlike BL Lacs from the complete X-ray-selected Einstein
Medium Sensitivity Survey (EMSS) sample (XBLs), most RBLs possess weak but
moderately luminous emission lines. And whereas nearly all XBLs have extended
power levels consistent with FR-1s, more than half of the RBLs have extended
radio power levels too luminous to be beamed FR-1 radio galaxies. In fact, we
find evidence for and examples of three distinct mechanisms for creating the BL
Lac phenomenon in the 1Jy sample: beamed FR-1s, beamed FR-2s and possibly a few
gravitationally-lensed quasars. The v/v_max determined for the 1Jy sample is
0.614+/-0.047, which is markedly different from the negative evolution seen in
the EMSS and other XBL samples. A correlation between logarithmic X-ray to
radio flux ratio and v/v_max is observed across the EMSS and 1Jy samples, from
negative evolution in the more extreme XBLs to positive evolution in the more
extreme RBLs. There is evidence that the selection criteria chosen by Stickel
et al. eliminates some BL Lac objects from the 1Jy sample, although how many is
unknown. And several objects currently in the sample have exhibited strong
emission lines in one or more epochs, suggesting they should be reclassified as
FSRQs. However these selection effects cannot account for the observed
discrepancy in XBL and RBL properties. From these observational properties we
conclude that RBLs and XBLs cannot be related by viewing angle alone, and that
RBLs are more closely related to FSRQs.

represents the first C/O estimates for bulge PNe. Out of 13 PNe with identified
dust types, 4 PNe have emission features associated with C-based grains, while
the remaining 9 have O-rich dust signatures. The low fraction of C-rich PNe,
<30%, contrasts with that for local PNe, around 80%, although it follows the
trend for a decreasing frequency of C-rich PNe with galactocentric radius
(paper~I). We investigate whether the PNe discussed here are linked to the
bulge stellar population (similar to type~IV, or halo, PNe) or the inner
Galactic disk (a young and super-metal-rich population). Although 60% of the
PNe with warm dust are convincing bulge members, none of the C-rich PNe satisfy
our criteria, and they are probably linked to the inner Galactic disk. In the
framework of single star evolution, the available information on bulge PNe
points towards a progenitor population similar in age to that of local PNe
(type I PNe are found in similar proportions), but super-metal-rich (to account
for the scarcity of C-rich objects). Yet the metallicities of bulge PNe, as
inferred from [O/H], fail to reach the required values - except for the C-rich
objects. It is likely that the sample discussed here is derived from a mixed
disk/bulge progenitor population and dominated by type IV PNe, as suggested by
Peimbert (1992). The much higher fraction of O-rich PNe in this sample than in
the solar neighbourhood should result in a proportionally greater injection of
silicate grains into the inner Galactic medium.

that the gravitational field red-shifts the frequency modes of the vacuum, a

real particle creation is derived. Application of this requirement on a
Schwartzchid black hole resulted in deducing an upper limit on the region,
outside the event horizon, where real particles can be created. Using this

(brane-like states) which exist at non-zero pictures only, i.e. are essentially
mixed with superconformal ghosts. Some of these states are massless, they are
responsible for creating D-branes. Other states are tachyonic (called ghost
tachyons) creating a problem for the vacuum stability of the NSR model. In this
paper we explore the role played by these tachyonic states in string dynamics.
We show that the ghost tachyons condense on D-branes, created by massless
brane-like states. Thus the vacuum stability is achieved dynamically, as the
effective ghost tachyon potential exactly cancels the D-brane tension, in full
analogy with Sen's mechanism. As a result, from perturbative NSR model point of
view, massless and tachyonic brane-like states appear to live in a parallel
world, as the brane is screened by the tachyonic veil. We extend the analysis
to the brane-antibrane pair in AdS space and show that in this case due to the
effect of the ghost tachyon condensation one can construct extra
time-dimensional phenomenological models without tachyons and antibranes.

proton-neutron pairing on the binding energies of pf-shell nuclei and his
influence on backbending rotors; coulomb energy differences and their
relationship with alignment. Proton-neutron correlations are found responsible
for the characteristic features of the isotopic shifts in calcium, the
parabolic dependence on A and the prominent odd-even staggering.

nucleus is investigated. A new approach, called the Uncorrelated Scattering
Approximation, is proposed. The main approximation involved is to neglect the
correlation between the fragments of the projectile in the region where the
interaction with the target is important. The formalism makes use of
hyper-spherical harmonics, Raynal-Revay coefficients and momentum-localized
wave functions to expand projectile channel wave functions in terms of products
of the channel wave function of the individual fragments. Within this approach,
the kinetic energy and angular momentum of each fragment is conserved during
the scattering process. The elastic, inelastic and break-up S-matrices are
obtained as an analytic combination involving the bound wave function of the
projectile and the product of the S-matrices of the fragments. The approach is
applied to describe the scattering of deuteron on $^{58}$Ni at several
energies. The results are compared with experimental data and
continuum-discretized coupled-channels calculations.

Two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell simulations show a transition from a
planar, electrostatic oscillation at $2\omega$, with $\omega$ the laser
frequency, to a 2D electromagnetic oscillation at frequency $\omega$ and
wavevector $k>\omega/c$. A new electron parametric instability, involving the
decay of a 1D electrostatic oscillation into two surface waves, is introduced
to explain the basic features of the 2D oscillations. This effect leads to the
rippling of the plasma surface within a few laser cycles, and is likely to have
a strong impact on laser interaction with solid targets.

"quant-ph/0105020","Bart Jongejan","Bart Jongejan","On Bell's Paradox","13 pages, TeX, 2 figures (stereograms)",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The correlations between the outcomes of pairs of spin component measurements
on particles in the singlet state exist and can be observed independently of
any a priori given frame of reference. We can even construct a frame of
reference that is based on these correlations. This observation-based frame of
reference is equivalent to the customary a priori given frame of reference of
the laboratory when describing real Bohm-Aharonov experiments.
  J.S. Bell has argued that local hidden parameter theories that reproduce the
predictions of Quantum Mechanics cannot exist, but the counterfactual reasoning
leading to Bell's conclusion is physically meaningless if the frame of
reference that is based on spin component measurements is accepted as the
backdrop for Bohm-Aharonov experiments.
  The refutal of Bell's proof opens up for the construction of a viable hidden
parameter theory. A model of a spin h/2 particle in terms of a non-flat metric
of space-time is shown to allow the predictions of quantum mechanics in the
Bohm-Aharonov experiment to be reproduced, without introducing non-locality.

Observability of vacuum-Rabi splitting depends on the strength and the
frequency dependence of the spectral density function characterizing the
interactions with phonons, both of which can be influenced by phonon
confinement.

Gen. 34, L631(2001)","10.1088/0305-4470/34/44/105",,"quant-ph",,"  Recently, it is proposed to do quantum computation through the Berry's
phase(adiabatic cyclic geometric phase) shift with NMR (Jones et al, Nature,
403, 869(2000)). This geometric quantum gate is hopefully to be fault tolerant
to certain types of errors because of the geometric property of the Berry
phase. Here we give a scheme to realize the NMR C-NOT gate through
Aharonov-Anandan's phase(non-adiabatic cyclic phase) shift on the dynamic phase
free evolution loop.
  In our scheme, the gate is run non-adiabatically, thus it is less affected by
the decoherence. And, in the scheme we have chosen the the zero dynamic phase
time evolution loop in obtaining the gepmetric phase shift, we need not take
any extra operation to cancel the dynamic phase.
