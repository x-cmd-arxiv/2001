be interpreted as the terminal velocities of the winds from Eta Car and from

the stellar X-ray emission from Eta Car and suggests that there was no

find that our viewing direction differs considerably from the commonly accepted
values, which has important implications for the structure of the LMC. The
discussion is based on an analysis of spatial variations in the apparent
magnitude of features in the near-IR color-magnitude diagrams extracted from
the DENIS and 2MASS surveys. Sinusoidal brightness variations with a
peak-to-peak amplitude of approximately 0.25 mag are detected as function of
position angle, for both AGB and RGB stars. This is naturally interpreted as
the result of distance variations, due to one side of the LMC plane being
closer to us than the opposite side. The best fitting geometric model of an
inclined plane yields an inclination angle i = 34.7 +/- 6.2 degrees and
line-of-nodes position angle Theta = 122.5 +/- 8.3 degrees. There is tentative
evidence that the LMC disk plane may be warped. Traditional methods to estimate
the position angle of the line of nodes have used either the major axis
position angle Theta_maj of the spatial distribution of tracers on the sky, or
the position angle Theta_max of the line of maximum gradient in the velocity
field, given that for a circular disk Theta_maj = Theta_max = Theta. The
present study does not rely on the assumption of circular symmetry, and is
considerably more accurate than previous studies of its kind. We find that the
actual position angle of the line of nodes differs considerably from both
Theta_maj and Theta_max, for which measurements have fallen in the range
140-190 degrees. This indicates that the intrinsic shape of the LMC disk is not
circular, but elliptical, as discussed further in Paper II. [Abridged]

viewing angles derived in Paper I, that the LMC is intrinsically elongated. I
argue that this is due to the tidal force from the Milky Way. The near-IR data
from the 2MASS and DENIS surveys are used to create a star count map of RGB and
AGB stars, which is interpreted through ellipse fitting. The radial number
density profile is approximately exponential with a scale-length 1.3-1.5 kpc.
However, there is an excess density at large radii that may be due to the tidal
effect of the Milky Way. The position angle and ellipticity profile converge to
PA_maj = 189.3 +/- 1.4 degrees and epsilon = 0.199 +/- 0.008 for r > 5 deg. At
large radii there is a drift of the center of the star count contours towards
the near side of the plane, which can be undrestood as due to viewing
perspective. The fact that PA_maj differes from the line of nodes position
angle Theta = 122.5 +/- 8.3 (cf. Paper I) indicates that the LMC disk is not
circular, but has an intrinsic ellipticity of 0.31. The LMC is elongated in the
general direction of the Galactic center, and is elongated perpendicular to the
Magellanic Stream and the velocity vector of the LMC center of mass. This
suggests that the elongation of the LMC has been induced by the tidal force of
the Milky Way. The position angle of the line of nodes differs from the
position angle Theta_max of the line of maximum line of sight velocity
gradient: Theta_max - Theta = 20-60 degrees. This could be due to: (a)
streaming along non-circular orbits in the elongated disk; (b) uncertainties in
the transverse motion of the LMC center of mass; (c) precession and nutation of
the LMC disk as it orbits the Milky Way (expected on theoretical grounds).

the recently discovered 16 ms X-ray pulsar PSR J0537-6910, the most rapidly
rotating young pulsar known.
  Using phase-resolved Chandra imaging, we pinpoint the location of the pulsar
to within an uncertainty of less than 1 arcsec. PSR J0537-6910 is not detected
in any other wavelength band. The X-ray observations resolve three distinct
features: the pulsar itself, a surrounding compact wind nebula which is
strongly elongated and a feature of large-scale diffuse emission trailing from
the pulsar. This latter comet tail-shaped feature coexists with enhanced radio
emission and is oriented nearly perpendicular to the major axis of the pulsar
wind nebula. We propose the following scenario to explain these features. The
bright, compact nebula is likely powered by a toroidal pulsar wind of
relativistic particles which is partially confined by the ram-pressure from the
supersonic motion of the pulsar. The particles, after being forced out from the
compact nebula (the head of the ``comet''), are eventually dumped into a bubble
(the tail), which is primarily responsible for the extended diffuse X-ray and
radio emission. The ram-pressure confinement also allows a natural explanation
for the observed X-ray luminosity of the compact nebula and for the unusually
small X-ray to spin-down luminosity ratio, compared to similarly energetic
pulsars. We estimate the pulsar wind Lorentz factor of N157B as about 4 times
10^6 (with an uncertainty of a factor about 2, consistent with that inferred

equivalent width ratio between the FeII blend at 4570 A and H-beta broad

accounted for if it is primarily driven by the ratio of AGN luminosity to black
hole mass (L/M proportional to Eddington ratio) convolved with source
orientation. L/M apparently drives the radio-quiet correlation only for
FWHM(H-beta) < 4000 km/s which includes Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies

requires convergent expansions in overlapping domains. If, in addition, the
initial values of the scaling fields associated with the unstable fixed point
can be calculated from the temperature and the parameters appearing in the
microscopic Hamiltonian, one can estimate the critical amplitudes. This
strategy has been developed using Dyson's hierarchical model where all the
steps can be approximately implemented with good accuracy. We show numerically
that for this model (and a simplified version of it), the required overlap

  Chemical Physics",,"10.1063/1.1383991",,"cond-mat",,"  Calculations of tunneling matrix elements associated with electron transfer
through molecular environments are usually done for given frozen nuclear
configurations, assuming that nuclear motions are slow relative to the
timescale of a tunneling event. The motivation for this study is a recent
calculation [Peskin et al, J. Chem. Phys. 111, 7558 (1999)] that indicates that
electron tunneling through water may be enhanced by tunneling resonances in the
range of ~1eV below the vacuum barrier and finds that the lifetimes of such
resonances are in the 10fs range, same order as OH stretch periods. Our
calculation is based on the absorbing-boundary-conditions-Green's-function
(ABCGF) method. First we consider the effect of a single symmetric OH-stretch
mode on electron tunneling in an otherwise frozen water environment and
establish that the inelastic tunneling probability is small enough to justify
an approach based on perturbation theory limited to single phonon transitions.
Next we note that on the short timescale of a tunneling event, even under
resonance conditions, water nuclear dynamics may be represented in the
instantaneous normal modes picture. We generalize the ABCGF method to take into
account low order inelastic scattering from a continuum of such harmonic normal
modes. We find that near resonance the total inelastic transmission probability
is of the same order as the elastic one, and may lead to an additional ~20-40%
enhancement of the overall transmission in the range of up to 1eV below the
vacuum barrier. The absolute energy exchange is small, of the order of 1% of
the incident electron energy. The main contribution to the inelastic
transmission is associated with energy transfer into the rotational-librational
range of the water instantaneous normal mode spectrum.

the singularity, is quantized in isotropic models of loop quantum cosmology by
using techniques which have been developed in quantum geometry for a
quantization of general relativity. This procedure results in a bounded
operator which is diagonalizable simultaneously with the volume operator and
whose eigenvalues are determined explicitly. For large scale factors (in fact,
up to a scale factor slightly above the Planck length) the eigenvalues are
close to the classical expectation, whereas below the Planck length there are
large deviations leading to a non-diverging behavior of the inverse scale
factor even though the scale factor has vanishing eigenvalues. This is a first
indication that the classical singularity is better behaved in loop quantum
cosmology.

and BELLE collaborations are in good agreement with the standard model (SM)
prediction, resulting from the unitarity of the CKM matrix. The so-called
minimal flavour violating (MFV) supersymmetric extensions of the standard
model, in which the CKM matrix remains the only flavour changing structure,
predict a(psi K) similar to the one in the SM. With the anticipated precision
in a(psi K) and other CP asymmetries at the B factories and hadron colliders,
one hopes to pin down any possible deviation from the SM. We discuss an
extension of the MFV-supersymmetric models which comfortably accommodates the
current measurements of the CP asymmetry a(psi K), but differs from the SM and
the MFV-supersymmetric models due to an additional flavour changing structure
beyond the CKM matrix. We suggest specific tests in forthcoming experiments in
B physics. In addition to the CP-asymmetries in B-meson decays, such as a(psi
K) and a(pi pi), and the mass difference Delta M_s in the Bs-bar(Bs) system, we
emphasize measurements of the radiative transition b -> d gamma as sensitive
probes of the postulated flavour changing structure. Interestingly, the
CKM-unitarity analysis in the Extended-MFV model also allows solutions rho < 0,
as opposed to the SM and the MFV models for which only rho > 0 solutions are
now admissible, implying gamma > pi/2, where gamma=- arg (Vub). Such large
values of gamma are hinted by the current measurements of the branching ratios
for the decays B -> pi pi and B -> K pi.

models pathogen mutation and individual memory immune responses, with contacted

significantly different from other strains in their memory repertoire. The
second model is a reduction of the first to a system of difference equations.
In this case, individuals spend a fixed amount of time in a generalized immune
class. In both models, we observe four fundamentally different types of
behavior, depending on parameters: (1) pathogen extinction due to lack of
contact between individuals, (2) endemic infection (3) periodic epidemic
outbreaks, and (4) one or more outbreaks followed by extinction of the epidemic
due to extremely low minima in the oscillations. We analyze both models to
determine the location of each transition. Our main result is that pathogens in
highly connected populations must mutate rapidly in order to remain viable.

Schroedinger equation, it has been not clear the role they play in describing
the physical systems. The main objective of this communication is precisely to
throw some light on the subject.

with a single linearly-polarized mode field. It is found that the degeneracy of
the atomic level affects the dissipation bahavior of the system as well as the
subsystems. The degeneracy of the atomic level augment the periods of
entanglement and increase the degree of the maxima statistical mixture states.
