clusters are at least a factor of 3 smaller than those observed in clusters
with similar velocity dispersions at z <= 0.4. These clusters contain a
significant population of elliptical-like galaxies, although these galaxies are
not nearly as dominant as in massive clusters at z <= 0.5. We also find a large
population of blue cluster members. Defining an active galaxy as one in which
the rest equivalent width of [OII] is greater than 15 Angstroms, the fraction
of active cluster galaxies, within the central 1.0 Mpc, is 45%. In the field
population, we find that 65% of the galaxies with redshifts between z = 0.40
and z = 0.85 are active, while the fraction is 79% for field galaxies at z >
0.85. The star formation rate normalized by the rest AB B-band magnitude, SFRN,
increases as the redshift increases at a given evolving luminosity. At a given
redshift, however, SFRN decreases linearly with increasing luminosity
indicating a remarkable insensitivity of the star formation rate to the
intrinsic luminosity of the galaxy over the range -18 >= ABB >= -22. Cluster
galaxies in the central 1 Mpc regions exhibit depressed star formation rates.
We are able to measure significant evolution in the B-band luminosity function
over the range 0.1 <= z <= 1. The characteristic luminosity increases by a
factor of 3 with increasing redshift over this range.

the line emission to previously observed optical line and radio emission. The
evidence indicates that the [FeII] emission is associated with the Seyfert

responsible for most of the [FeII] emission, although differences in [FeII] and
Pa-beta line profiles associated with radio emission suggests that the [FeII]
emission is enhanced by fast shocks associated with radio outflows. The H2
emission is not as strongly associated with outflows or ionization cones as is
the emission in other lines, but rather appears to be primarily associated with
the disk of the galaxy.

Group irregular galaxy IC 10. The images are used to determine the nature of
the stellar products in a portion of the recent starburst in this galaxy. We
identified 13 stellar associations and clusters, two of which are probably old
(>350 Myr) and the rest of which are young (4-30 Myr) and presumably formed in
the starburst. We found the following: 1) The slope of the stellar initial mass
function (IMF) for 6.3--18 Msolar stars formed in the starburst lies between
two limiting cases: a value of -1.9+/-0.4 under the assumption of coevality
over the past 13 Myr and of -0.9+/-0.3 under the assumption of constant star
formation over the past 40 Myr. Thus, most likely, the IMF of the intermediate
mass stars is not very unusual. The slope of the IMF for the underlying galaxy
population under the assumption of constant star formation is -2.6+/-0.3 for
4.8-18 Msolar stars. 2) The lower stellar mass limit in the starburst is <6.3
Msolar. This constraint is less than some predictions of what lower stellar
mass limits might be in starbursts, but higher than others. 3) There are two
modest-sized Halpha shells that could easily have been produced in the past few
Myr by the clusters they encircle. 4) The dominant mode of star formation in
the starburst has been that of a scaled-up OB association. This mode, with a
few compact clusters sprinkled in, is similar to the star formation that took
place in Constellation III in the LMC, as well as that in the Blue Compact
Dwarfs IZw18 and VIIZw403. The starburst in this part of IC10 has not produced
a super star cluster. We suggest that the high WC/WN ratio could be reproduced
if there were small, well-synchronized (<1 Myr), but widely scattered, pockets
of secondary star formation 3-4 Myr ago.

clusters and groups. Major cluster mergers are the most energetic events in the
Universe since the Big Bang. Mergers drive shocks into the intracluster gas,
and these shocks heat the intracluster gas, and should also accelerate
nonthermal relativistic particles. The thermal effects of merger shocks will be
briefly discussed. Mergers can increase the temperature and X-ray luminosities
of clusters, and this may affect statistical conclusions about cosmological
parameters. As a result of particle acceleration in shocks, clusters of
galaxies should contain very large populations of relativistic electrons and
ions. Electrons with Lorentz factors gamma~300 (energies E = gamma m_e c^2 ~
150 MeV) are expected to be particularly common. Observations and models for
the radio, extreme ultraviolet, hard X-ray, and gamma-ray emission from
nonthermal particles accelerated in these shocks will also be described. The
predicted gamma-ray fluxes of clusters should make them easily observable with

fractionally by $\sim 10^{-10} - 10^{-6}$. Glitches are ascribed to variable
coupling between the neutron star crust and its superfluid interior. With the
aim of distinguishing among different theoretical explanations for the glitch
phenomenon, we study the response of a neutron star to two types of
perturbations to the vortex array that exists in the superfluid interior: 1)
thermal motion of vortices pinned to inner crust nuclei, initiated by sudden
heating of the crust, (e.g., a starquake), and 2) mechanical motion of
vortices, (e.g., from crust cracking by superfluid stresses). Both mechanisms
produce acceptable fits to glitch observations in four pulsars, with the
exception of the 1989 glitch in the Crab pulsar, which is best fit by the
thermal excitation model. The two models make different predictions for the
generation of internal heat and subsequent enhancement of surface emission. The
mechanical glitch model predicts a negligible temperature increase. For a pure
and highly-conductive crust, the thermal glitch model predicts a surface
temperature increase of as much as $\sim$ 2%, occurring several weeks after the
glitch. If the thermal conductivity of the crust is lowered by a high
concentration of impurities, however, the surface temperature increases by
$\sim$ 10% about a decade after a thermal glitch. A thermal glitch in an impure
crust is consistent with the surface emission limits following the January 2000
glitch in the Vela pulsar. Future surface emission measurements coordinated
with radio observations will constrain glitch mechanisms and the conductivity
of the crust.

power-law distribution as indicated by the test particle limit of the diffusive

due to adiabatic expansion/compression, Coulomb collisions and inelastic p-p
scattering. Our results suggest that CR protons produced at shocks formed in
association with the process of large scale structure formation could amount to
a substantial fraction of the total pressure in the intra-cluster medium. Their
presence should be easily revealed by GLAST through detection of gamma-ray flux
from the decay of neutral pions produced in inelastic p-p collisions of such CR
protons with nuclei of the intra-cluster gas. This measurement will allow a
direct determination of the CR pressure contribution in the intra-cluster
medium. We also find that the spatial distribution of CR is typically more
irregular than that of the thermal gas because it is more influenced by the
underlying distribution of shocks. This feature is reflected in the appearance
of our gamma-ray synthetic images. Finally, the average CR pressure
distribution appears statistically slightly more extended than the thermal
pressure.

Luttinger-Ward functional, in terms of renormalized perturbation theory in the

at low temperatures by electrons. We also observe distinct changes in the
magnetoresistance associated with the transition between the electron- and
hole-dominated transport regimes. These results are of direct relevance to
MnAs/semiconductor hybrid heterostructures and their exploitation in electronic

the process of hadronization in such a picture for the case when the
quark-hadron transition is of first order, and argue that the inside region of
such a shell must correspond to a supercooled (to $T = 0$) deconfined vacuum.
Hadrons from that region escape out, leaving a bubble of pure deconfined vacuum
with large vacuum energy. This bubble undergoes relativistic collapse, with
highly Lorentz contracted bubble walls, and may concentrate the entire energy
into extremely small regions. Eventually different portions of bubble wall
collide, with the energy being released in the form of particle production.
Thermalization of this system can lead to very high temperatures. With a
reasonably conservative set of parameters, at LHC, the temperature of the hot
spot can reach as high as 3 GeV, and well above it with more optimistic
parameters. Such a hot spot can leave signals like large $P_T$ partons,
dileptons, and enhanced production of heavy quarks. We also briefly discuss a
speculative possibility where the electroweak symmetry may get restored in the
highly dense region resulting from the decay of the bubble wall via the
phenomenon of non-thermal symmetry restoration (which is usually employed in
models of pre-heating after inflation). If that could happen then the
possibility may arise of observing sphaleron induced baryon number violation in
relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

models with sub-millimeter extra dimensions provide naturally light sterile

having vacuum oscillations of the nu_e to its zero mode and MSW oscillations to
its first few Kaluza-Klein modes. While the prediction of the Super-Kamiokande
energy spectrum gives a fit probability of 73%, the superior energy resolution
of SNO's charged-current spectrum will determine whether this neutrino scheme
is correct and can demonstrate that an extra dimension of ~60 mu m exists.

approximations of continuous multivariable functions in both neuron-like and
quantum form. The implementation of this model in the form of a multi-barrier,
multiple-slit system is proposed and it is demonstrated that this single
neuron-like model is able to perform the XOR function unrealizable with single
classical neuron. For the simplified waveguide variant of this model it is
proved for different interfering quantum alternatives with no correlated
adjustable parameters, that the system can approximate any continuous function
of many variables. This theorem is applied to the 2-input quantum neural model
based on the use of the schemes developed for controlled nonlinear multiphoton
absorption of light by quantum systems. The relation between the field of
quantum neural computing and quantum control is discussed.

  Afterburner","5 pages, 3 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  By using a laser and maser in tandem, it is possible to obtain laser action
in the hot exhaust gases involved in heat engine operation. Such a ""quantum
afterburner"" involves the internal quantum states of working gas atoms or
molecules as well as the techniques of cavity quantum electrodynamics and is
therefore in the domain of quantum thermodynamics. As an example, it is shown
that Otto cycle engine performance can be improved beyond that of the ""ideal""
Otto heat engine.

the temporal non-locality of quantum mechanics by using the temporal Bell
inequality, which will be derived for a discretized network dynamics by
identifying the subsystem indices with (discrete) parameter time. However, the
direct ``observation'' of the quantum system will lead to no violation of the
temporal Bell inequality and to consistent histories of any subsystem. Its
violation can be demonstrated, though, for a delayed-choice measurement.
