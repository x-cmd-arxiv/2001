radiatively inefficient spherical accretion onto a black hole. The simulations
are initialized with a Bondi flow, and with a weak, dynamically unimportant,
large-scale magnetic field. The magnetic field is amplified as the gas flows
in. When the magnetic pressure approaches equipartition with the gas pressure,
the field begins to reconnect and the gas is heated up. The heated gas is
buoyant and moves outward, causing line stretching of the frozen-in magnetic
field. This leads to further reconnection, and more heating and
buoyancy-induced motions, so that the flow makes a transition to a state of
self-sustained convection. The radial structure of the flow changes
dramatically from its initial Bondi profile, and the mass accretion rate onto
the black hole decreases significantly. Motivated by the numerical results, we
develop a simplified analytical model of a radiatively inefficient spherical
flow in which convective transport of energy to large radii plays an important
role. In this ""convection-dominated Bondi flow"" the accretion velocity is
highly subsonic and the density varies with radius as ~R^{-1/2} rather than the
standard Bondi scaling ~R^{-3/2}. We estimate that the mass accretion rate onto
the black hole is significantly less than the Bondi accretion rate.
Convection-dominated Bondi flows may be relevant for understanding many
astrophysical phenomena, e.g. post-supernova fallback and radiatively
inefficient accretion onto supermassive black holes, stellar-mass black holes
and neutron stars.

consistent ties to the Hubble flow. However, we confirm a systematic offset of
about 0.25 mag in the distance zero points of the two methods, and we trace
this offset to their respective Cepheid calibrations. SBF has in the past been
calibrated with Cepheid distances from the H_0 Key Project team, while SNIa
have been calibrated with Cepheid distances from the team composed of Sandage,
Saha, and collaborators. When the two methods are calibrated in a consistent
way, their distances are in superb agreement. Until the conflict over the
``long'' and ``short'' extragalactic Cepheid distances among many galaxies is
resolved, we cannot definitively constrain the Hubble constant to better than
about 10%, even leaving aside the additional uncertainty in the distance to the
Large Magellanic Cloud, common to both Cepheid scales. However, recent
theoretical SBF predictions from stellar population models favor the Key
Project Cepheid scale, while the theoretical SNIa calibration lies between the
long and short scales. In addition, while the current SBF distance to M31/M32
is in good agreement with the RR Lyrae and red giant branch distances,
calibrating SBF with the longer Cepheid scale would introduce a 0.3 mag offset

association of gamma-ray bursts with massive stars. We argue that low ambient
density regions naturally exist in areas of active star formation as the
interiors of superbubbles. The evolution of the interior bubble density as a
function of time for different assumptions about the evaporative or
hydrodynamical mass loading of the bubble interior is discussed. We present a
number of reasons why there should exist a large range of inferred afterglow
ambient densities whether gamma-ray bursts arise in massive stars or some
version of compact star coalescence. We predict that many gamma-ray bursts will
be identified with X-ray bright regions of galaxies, corresponding to
superbubbles, rather than with blue localized regions of star formation.
Massive star progenitors are expected to have their own circumstellar winds.
The lack of evidence for individual stellar winds associated with the
progenitor stars for the cases with afterglows in especially low density
environments may imply low wind densities and hence low mass loss rates
combined with high velocities. If gamma-ray bursts are associated with massive

that this difference can be accommodated in the unified schemes if a minimum
level of Seyfert activity is required for a radio source to emerge from the
vicinity of the active nucleus. Below this level, Seyfert radio sources might
be suppressed by free-free absorption associated with the nuclear torus or a
compact narrow-line region, thus accounting for both the weakness of the radio

distinguishing the magneto-Jeans instability (MJI) that arises under
inner-galaxy rotation curves from the modified swing amplification (MSA) that
arises under outer-galaxy rotation curves. For axisymmetric density
fluctuations, instability is known to require a Toomre parameter Q<1. For
nonaxisymmetric fluctuations, any nonzero shear $q \equiv -d\ln \Omega /d \ln
R$ winds up wavefronts such that in linear theory amplification saturates. Any
Q threshold for nonaxisymmetric gravitational runaway must originate from
nonlinear effects. We use numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations to
demonstrate the anticipated threshold phenomenon, to analyze the nonlinear
processes involved, and to evaluate the critical value $Q_c$ for stabilization.
We find $Q_c \sim 1.2-1.4$ for a wide variety of conditions, with the largest
values corresponding to nonzero but subthermal mean magnetic fields. Our
findings for $Q_c$ are similar to those inferred from thresholds for active
star formation in the outer regions of spiral galaxies. MJI is distinct from
MSA in that opposition to Coriolis forces by magnetic tension, rather than
cooperation of epicyclic motion with kinematic shear, enables nonaxisymmetric
density perturbations to grow. We suggest that under low-shear inner-disk
conditions, $Q_c$ will be larger than that in outer disks by a factor $\sim
(v_A/q c_s)^{1/2}$, where $v_A$ and $c_s$ are the respective Alfven and sound
speeds.

worked out by borrowing a standard method from Molecular Dynamics: the time
averages of suitable quantities are numerically computed along the dynamical
trajectories to yield thermodynamic observables. The link between dynamics and
thermodynamics is made in the microcanonical ensemble of statistical mechanics.
The dynamics of self-gravitating $N$-body systems has been computed using two
different kinds of regularization of the newtonian interaction: the usual
softening and a truncation of the Fourier expansion series of the two-body
potential. $N$ particles of equal masses are constrained in a finite three
dimensional volume. Through the computation of basic thermodynamic observables
and of the equation of state in the $P - V$ plane, new evidence is given of the
existence of a second order phase transition from a homogeneous phase to a
clustered phase. This corresponds to a crossover from a polytrope of index
$n=3$, i.e. $p=K V^{-4/3}$, to a perfect gas law $p=K V^{-1}$, as is shown by
the isoenergetic curves on the $P - V$ plane. The dynamical-microcanonical
averages are compared to their corresponding canonical ensemble averages,
obtained through standard Monte Carlo computations. A major disagreement is
found, because the canonical ensemble seems to have completely lost any
information about the phase transition. The microcanonical ensemble appears as
the only reliable statistical framework to tackle self-gravitating systems.
Finally, our results -- obtained in a ``microscopic'' framework -- are compared
with some existing theoretical predictions -- obtained in a ``macroscopic''

minimum mass of objects taken into account. We find that for a given final halo
mass the redshift dependence of the merger fraction F_mg and the resulting
merger rate can be fitted well by a power law for redshifts z <= 1. The
normalization F_{mg}(0) and the slope m depend on the final halo mass. For a
given merger timescale t_merg and an assumed maximum mass ratio R_major for
major mergers, F_mg(0) and m depend exponentially on each other. The slope m
depends logarithmically on the ratio of the final halo mass and the minimum
halo mass taken into account. In addition, the local normalization F_{mg}(0)
increases for larger R_{major} while m decreases. We compare the predicted
merger fractionwith recent observations and find that the model cannot
reproduce both the merger index and the normalization at the same time. In
general the model underestimates F_{mg}(0) and m by a factor of 2.

persistent mass accretion rate. The presence of short bursts in GX 17+2 (and
similar bright X-ray sources) is not accounted for in the current X-ray bursts
theories at the high mass accretion rates encountered in these sources. We find
that in contrast to previous suggestions the persistent black-body emission
does NOT arise from the same site as the burst emission. The black-body
component of the persistent emission is consistent with arising in an expanded
boundary layer, as indicated by recent theoretical work. The total persistent
flux just before and after the radius expansion bursts is inferred to be up to
a factor of 2 higher than the net peak flux of the burst. If both the burst and
persistent emission are radiated isotropically, this would imply that the
persistent emission is up to a factor of 2 higher than the Eddington
luminosity. This is unlikely and we suggest that the persistent luminosity is
close to the Eddington luminosity and that the burst emission is (highly)
anisotropic. Assuming that the net burst peak fluxes equal the Eddington limit,
applying standard burst parameters (1.4 M_sun neutron star, cosmic composition,

on GaAs(001), a growth model is presented that builds on results of DFT
calculations for molecular processes on the beta2-reconstructed GaAs(001)

Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on the basis of the calculated energetics
enable us to model MBE growth of GaAs from beams of Ga and As_2 in atomistic
detail. The simulations show that island nucleation is controlled by the
reaction of As_2 molecules with Ga adatoms on the surface. The analysis reveals
that the scaling laws of standard nucleation theory for the island density as a
function of growth temperature are not applicable to GaAs epitaxy. We also
discuss heteroepitaxy of InAs on GaAs(001), and report first-principles DFT
calculations for In diffusion on the strained GaAs substrate. In particular we
address the effect of heteroepitaxial strain on the growth kinetics of
coherently strained InAs islands. The strain field around an island is found to
cause a slowing-down of material transport from the substrate towards the
island and thus helps to achieve more homogeneous island sizes.

classical Heisenberg Hamiltonian, the partition function for clusters with p =
2, 3, 4 ,...spins in the presence of the inhomogeneous symmetry breaking fields
(SBF) created by spins outside the unit is calculated. The effective fields
characterizing the interaction between units naturally arise as averages over
the SBF. These effective fields are fixed by a self-consistency condition. In
the paramagnetic regime, we recover all the results previously obtained in a
more phenomenological way, which were shown to be in excellent agreement with
Monte Carlo calculations for these lattices. In the absence of applied magnetic
field, it is found that, for antiferromagnetic interactions, the equilibrium
configuration is a non-collinear configuration in which the total magnetization
of the unit is zero, and the condition under which such an ordered state occurs
is also obtained from the calculation.
  However, frustration inhibits the formation of such an state, and the system
remains paramagnetic down to 0 K, if only nearest neighbor interactions are
taken into account, for all the systems considered. Furthermore, we also study
the effect of next nearest neighbor interactions (NNN) and site dilution by
non-magnetic impurities for the pyrochlore lattice. It is found that NNN
interactions can stabilize a non-collinear ordered state, or ferromagnetic one,
depending on the relation between NN and NNN interactions, and the phase
diagram is calculated. However, site dilution is not enough by itself to form
such an ordered state.

reduced Einstein-massless-Klein-Gordon model using a first order approach for
geometric quantities, because phenomenologically it is probably the most
relevant of all dilaton models with matter. After a Hamiltonian BRST analysis
path integral quantization is performed using temporal gauge for the Cartan
variables. Retrospectively, the simpler Faddeev-Popov approach turns out to be
sufficient. It is possible to eliminate all unphysical and geometric quantities
establishing a non-local and non-polynomial action depending solely on the
scalar field and on some integration constants, fixed by suitable boundary
conditions on the asymptotic effective line element.
  Then, attention is turned to the evaluation of the (two) lowest order tree
vertices, explicitly assuming a perturbative expansion in the scalar field
being valid. Each of them diverges, but unexpected cancellations yield a finite
S-matrix element when both contributions are summed. The phenomenon of a
""virtual black hole"" -- already encountered in the simpler case of minimally
coupled scalars in two dimensions -- occurs, as the study of the (matter
dependent) metric reveals. A discussion of the scattering amplitude leads to
the prediction of gravitational decay of spherical waves, a novel physical
phenomenon. Several possible extensions conclude this dissertation.

restoration high in the spectrum is consistent with the concept of quark-hadron

highly excited baryons, then the MacDowell symmetry requires the parity
doubling to appear, which shows that linear Regge trajectories and chiral
symmetry restoration are well compatible. On the contrary, in the low-energy

seen by observers trapped on a 3-brane, with the inflaton being the inter-brane
separation. Although most of our discussion refers to arbitrary p-branes, when
we need to be specific we assume that they are D-branes of Type II or Type I
string theory. For realistic brane couplings, such as those arising in string
theory, the inter-brane potentials are too steep to inflate the universe for
acceptably long times. However, for special regions of the parameter space of
brane-antibrane positions the brane motion is slow enough for there to be
sufficient inflation. Inflation would be more generic in models where the
inter-brane interactions are much weaker. The spectrum of primordial density
fluctuations predicted has index n slightly less than 1, and an acceptable
amplitude, provided that the extra dimensions have linear size 1/r ~ 10^{12}
GeV. Reheating occurs as in hybrid inflation, with the tachyonic instability of
the brane-antibrane system taking over for small separations. The tachyon field
can induce a cascade mechanism within which higher-dimension branes annihilate
into lower-dimension ones. We argue that such a cascade naturally stops with
the production of 3-branes in 10-dimensional string theory.

a scattering process in which the cloud, acting very much like a thin shell,
contracts and eventually bounces off the cores of the massive monopoles. The

which are numerically positive on analytic cycles, i.e. $\int_Y\alpha^p>0$ for
every irreducible analytic set $Y$ in $X$, \hbox{$p=\dim Y$}. This result is
new even in the case of projective manifolds, where it can be seen as a
generalization of the well-known Nakai-Moishezon criterion, and it also extends
previous results by Campana-Peternell and Eyssidieux. The principal technical
step is to show that every nef class $\{\alpha\}$ which has positive highest
self-intersection number $\int_X\alpha^n>0$ contains a K\""ahler current; this
is done by using the Calabi-Yau theorem and a mass concentration technique for
Monge-Amp\`ere equations. The main result admits a number of variants and
corollaries, including a description of the cone of numerically effective

that for an arbitrary deformation $\cX\to S$ of compact K\""ahler manifolds, the

studied for a general, localized, response function. It is shown that there
always exists a finite number of well-separated MI gain bands, with each of
them characterised by a unique maximal growth rate. This is a general property
and is demonstrated here for the Gaussian, exponential, and rectangular
response functions. In case of a focusing nonlinearity it is shown that
although the nonlocality tends to suppress MI, it can never remove it
completely, irrespectively of the particular shape of the response function.
For a defocusing nonlinearity the stability properties depend sensitively on
the profile of the response function. It is shown that plane waves are always
stable for response functions with a positive-definite spectrum, such as
Gaussians and exponentials. On the other hand, response functions whose spectra
change sign (e.g., rectangular) will lead to MI in the high wavenumber regime,
provided the typical length scale of the response function exceeds a certain
threshold. Finally, we address the case of generalized multi-component response
functions consisting of a weighted sum of N response functions with known
properties.

exchange produces realistic nuclear binding. The underlying saturation
mechanism is surprisingly simple (in the chiral limit), namely the combination
of an attractive $k_f^3$-term and a repulsive $k_f^4$-term. The empirical
saturation point and the nuclear compressibility $K\simeq 250 $MeV are well
reproduced at order ${\cal O}(k_f^5)$ with a momentum cut-off of $\Lambda

with eleven dimensional space-time with two boundary 9-branes separated by a
finite gap spanning an intervening bulk volume. The triplet transition starts
when the bulk 9-brane is generated from the hidden boundary 9-brane, and
collides with the pre-observable 9-brane. The collision starts the inflation
transition. The collision is the brane dimensional interference mixing between
the pre-observable 9-brane and the bulk 9-brane. The results are the mixed
branes (combined brane dimensions), the internal space (cancelled brane
dimensions), the bulk space, 3-brane vacuum, and cosmic radiation. Cosmic
radiation generated during the inflation leads to the big bang. Meanwhile, the
hidden brane undergoes stepwise fractionalization, changing in stepwise manner
