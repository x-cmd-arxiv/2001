The intensities are too large for the emission to originate solely in the Local

O VI-bearing gas fills a small volume. The observations can also be used to
estimate the cooling rate of the hot interstellar medium and constrain models.

in last two years has been deeply modified into a fountain beamed Jet exploding
and interacting on external shells to explain GRB fine time structure. On the
contrary earlier we proposed a unified scenario for both GRBs-SGRs where a
precessing Gamma Jet (of different intensity) and its geometrical beaming is
the source of both GRB and SGRs wide morphology. GRBs are peaked SNs Jet
spinning and precessing observed along the thin Jet axis. Their mysterious weak
X precursors bursts, corresponding to non-negligible energy powers, up to
million Supernova ones for GRB, are gamma Jet tails beamed off-axis, observed
at X-Ray tails. They are rare, about (3-6)% of all GRBs, but not unique at all.
Comparable brief X-ray precursor flashes occurred in rarest and most detailed
SGRs events as the 27 and the 29 August 1998 event from SGR 1900+14. The same
source has been in very power-full activity on recent 18 April 2001 once again

marginal blazing of outlying X conical precessing Jet, an off-axis tails

objects exposed to the external ultraviolet background (UVB) radiation.
Assuming spherical symmetry, we solve self-consistently radiative transfer of
photons, non-equilibrium H2 chemistry, and gas hydrodynamics. Although the UVB
does suppress the formation of low mass objects, the negative feedback turns
out to be weaker than previously suggested. In particular, the cut-off scale of
collapse drops significantly below the virial temperature 10^4 K at weak UV
intensities, due to both self-shielding of the gas and H2 cooling. Clouds above
this cut-off tend to contract highly dynamically, further promoting
self-shielding and H2 formation. For plausible radiation intensities and
spectra, the collapsing gas can cool efficiently to temperatures well below
10^4 K before rotationally supported and the final H2 fraction reaches 10^{-3}.
Our results imply that star formation can take place in low mass objects
collapsing in the UVB. The threshold baryon mass for star formation is \sim
10^9 solar mass for clouds collapsing at redshifts z \simlt 3, but drops
significantly at higher redshifts. In a conventional cold dark matter universe,
the latter coincides roughly with that of the 1 \sigma density fluctuations.
Objects near and above this threshold can thus constitute `building blocks' of
luminous structures, and we discuss their links to dwarf spheroidal/elliptical
galaxies and faint blue objects. These results suggest that the UVB can play a
key role in regulating the star formation history of the Universe.

early photospheric phase, while spectropolarimetry of SN 1999gi was obtained
near the start of the transition to the nebular phase. Uncorrected for
interstellar polarization (ISP), SN 1997ds is characterized by p_V = 0.85 +/-
0.02%, SN 1998A has p_V = 0.24 +/- 0.05%, and SN 1999gi is polarized at p_V =
5.72 +/- 0.01%. The low continuum polarization inferred for SN 1997ds and SN
1998A and the amplitude of polarization modulations across strong line features
are consistent with those measured at similar epochs for SN 1987A and the Type
II-plateau SN 1999em, and supports the growing consensus that core-collapse
events with hydrogen envelopes substantially intact at the time of explosion
are not significantly aspherical during the early photospheric phase.
  The spectral shape of the high continuum polarization of SN 1999gi closely
resembles a ``Serkowski'' ISP curve, and is inconsistent with the
wavelength-independent nature of electron scattering expected for an aspherical
SN atmosphere. Since Galactic reddening is minimal along this line-of-sight,
the majority of the observed polarization in SN 1999gi is believed to be due to
ISP of the host galaxy, although significant (up to p = 2%) intrinsic
polarization cannot be ruled out. The potential power of SN spectropolarimetry
to study the properties of interstellar dust in external galaxies is described
and applied to the SN 1999gi data, where it is shown that if the polarization
is indeed predominantly interstellar in origin, then R_V = 3.0 +/- 0.2 for the
dust along this line-of-sight in NGC 3184.

compare different strengths of SNe feedback.In combination with stellar
population synthesis, we derive the photometric properties of simulation
end-products, including the magnitude, color, half-light radius, and abundance
ratios, and compare them with the observed scaling relations directly and
quantitatively. We find that the extremely strong influence of SNe is required
to reproduce the observed color-magnitude relation (CMR), where we assume each
SN yields energy of 4x10^51 ergs and that 90% of this energy is ejected as
kinetic feedback. The feedback affects the evolution of lower mass systems more
strongly and induces the galactic wind by which a larger fraction of gas is
blown out in a lower mass system. Finally higher mass systems become more metal
rich and have redder colors than lower mass systems. We emphasize based on our
simulation results that the galactic wind is triggered mainly by SNe Ia rather
than SNe II. In addition we examined the Kormendy relation, which prescribes
the size of elliptical galaxies, and the [Mg/Fe]--magnitude relation, which
provides a strong constraint on the star formation history.

This paper deals with the question whether this assumption is applicable for
tenous circumstellar disks around young A stars. In this paper the thin
hydrostatic equilibrium models described by Kamp & Bertoldi (2000) are combined
with a detailed heating/cooling balance for the gas. The most important heating
and cooling processes are heating through infrared pumping, heating due to the
drift velocity of dust grains, and fine structure and molecular line cooling.
Throughout the whole disk gas and dust are not efficiently coupled by
collisions and hence their temperatures are quite different. Most of the gas in
the disk models considered here stays well below 300 K. In the temperature
range below 300 K the gas chemistry is not much affected by T_gas and therefore
the simplifying approximation T_gas = T_dust can be used for calculating the
chemical structure of the disk. Nevertheless the gas temperature is important
for the quantitative interpretation of observations, like fine structure and

exists for this equation, it is known to be ill-behaved, and thus very
sensitive to the statistical noise present in the input M2 sin i distribution.
To overcome that difficulty, we present two robust, independent approaches: (i)
the formal solution of the integral equation is numerically computed after
performing an optimal smoothing of the input distribution, (ii) the
Lucy-Richardson algorithm is used to invert the integral equation. Both
approaches give consistent results. The resulting statistical distribution of
exoplanet true masses reveals that there is no reason to ascribe the transition

ruled out. A reasonable representation of the observations can be obtained by a

from an optical to radio flux ratio caution should be paid to optical thickness

have been raised about the relevant phonon modes, and the gap and Fermi surface
anisotropies, in an effort to interpret spectroscopic and thermal data that

hand gestures have been explored as means of human-computer interaction (HCI).
Together with improved speech processing technology it is an important step
toward natural multimodal HCI. However, inclusion of non-predefined continuous
gestures into a multimodal framework is a challenging problem. In this paper,
we propose a structured approach for studying patterns of multimodal language
in the context of a 2D-display control. We consider systematic analysis of
gestures from observable kinematical primitives to their semantics as pertinent
to a linguistic structure. Proposed semantic classification of co-verbal
gestures distinguishes six categories based on their spatio-temporal deixis. We
discuss evolution of a computational framework for gesture and speech
integration which was used to develop an interactive testbed (iMAP). The
testbed enabled elicitation of adequate, non-sequential, multimodal patterns in
a narrative mode of HCI. Conducted user studies illustrate significance of
accounting for the temporal alignment of gesture and speech parts in semantic
mapping. Furthermore, co-occurrence analysis of gesture/speech production
suggests syntactic organization of gestures at the lexical level.

physics of Kaluza-Klein theory, brane theory and string theory. The so-called
canonical or warp metric in 5D effectively converts the manifold from a
coordinate space to a momentum space, resulting in a new force (per unit mass)
parallel to the 4D velocity. The form of this extra force is actually
independent of the form of the metric, but for an unbound particle is tiny
because it is set by the energy density of the vacuum or cosmological constant.
It can be related to a small change in the rest mass of a particle, and can be
evaluated in two convenient gauges relevant to gravitational and quantum
systems. In the quantum gauge, the extra force leads to Heisenberg's relation
between increments in the position and momenta. If the 4D action is quantized
then so is the higher-dimensional part, implying that particle mass is
quantized, though only at a level of 10^{-65} gm or less which is unobservably
small. It is noted that massive particles which move on timeline paths in 4D
can move on null paths in 5D. This agrees with the view from inflationary
quantum field theory, that particles acquire mass dynamically in 4D but are
intrinsically massless. A general prescription for dynamics is outlined,
wherein particles move on null paths in an N(>4)D manifold which may be flat,
but have masses set by an embedded 4D manifold which is curved.

multi-layer silicon vertex tracker surrounded by a cylindrical wire drift
chamber. Electromagentic showers from electrons and photons are detected in an
array of CsI crystals located just inside the solenoidal coil of a
superconducting magnet. Muons and neutral hadrons are identified by arrays of
resistive plate chambers inserted into gaps in the steel flux return of the
magnet. Charged hadrons are identified by dE/dx measurements in the tracking
detectors and in a ring-imaging Cherenkov detector surrounding the drift
chamber. The trigger, data acquisition and data-monitoring systems, VME- and
network-based, are controlled by custom-designed online software. Details of
the layout and performance of the detector components and their associated
electronics and software are presented.

degenerate flavors of dynamical quarks, identified with up and down quarks, and
with a strange quark treated in the quenched approximation. The lattice action

extrapolation to the continuum limit as well as chiral extrapolations. Gauge
configurations are generated with a renormalization-group improved gauge action
and a mean field improved clover quark action at three values of $\beta$ and
four sea quark masses. The sizes of lattice are chosen so that the physical
spatial size is kept constant. Hadron masses, light quark masses and meson
decay constants are measured at five valence quark masses. We also carry out
complementary quenched simulations with the same improved actions. The quenched
spectrum from this analysis agrees well in the continuum limit with the one of
our earlier work using the standard action. We find the two-flavor full QCD
meson masses in the continuum limit to be much closer to experimental meson
masses than those from quenched QCD. We take these results as manifestations of
sea quark effects in two-flavor full QCD. For baryon masses full QCD values for
strange baryons are in agreement with experiment, while they differ
increasingly with decreasing strange quark content, resulting in a nucleon mass
higher than experiment. The pattern suggests finite size effects as a possible
origin for this deviation. For light quark masses in the continuum limit we
obtain values which are reduced by about 25% compared to the values in quenched
QCD. We also present results for decay constants where large scaling violations
obstruct a continuum extrapolation. Need for a non-perturbative estimate of

small as a consequence of a PQ-like symmetry. There is a Higgs sector which is
somewhat similar to that of the MSSM and the scalar potential parameters have a

and D1-branes and momentum modes in type IIB string theory compactified on K3.
Since these black holes incorporate D5-branes wrapped on K3, an enhancon locus
appears in the spacetime geometry. With a `small' number of D1-branes, the
entropy of a black hole is maximised by including precisely half as many
D5-branes as there are D1-branes in the black hole. Any attempts to introduce
more D5-branes, and so reduce the entropy, are thwarted by the appearance of
the enhancon locus above the horizon, which then prevents their approach. The
enhancon mechanism thereby acts to uphold the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
This result generalises: For each type of bound state object which can be made
of both types of brane, we show that a new type of enhancon exists at
successively smaller radii in the geometry, again acting to prevent any
reduction of the entropy just when needed. We briefly explore the appearance of
the enhancon in the black hole interior.

  We also discuss the bosonic sector of 5d gauged supergravity with single
scalar and taking the boundary action as predicted by supersymmetry and discuss
the possibility to supersymmetrize dilatonic New Brane World. It is
demonstrated that for a number of superpotentials the flat SUSY dilatonic
brane-world (with dynamically induced brane dilaton) or quantum-induced de
Sitter dilatonic brane-world (not Anti-de Sitter one) where SUSY is broken by
the quantum effects occurs. The analysis of graviton perturbations indicates
that gravity is localized on such branes.
  New Brane World is useful in the study of FRW dynamics and cosmological
entropy bounds. Brane stress tensor is induced by quantum effects of dual CFT
and brane crosses the horizon of AdS black hole. The similarity between CFT
entropy at the horizon and FRW equations is extended on the quantum level. This
suggests the way to understand cosmological entropy bounds in quantum gravity.

numbers'' that are extensions of $\slk$ to the case of nonzerohomologous framed
knots.
  As a corollary we get that $|K|=\infty$ for all knots in an oriented (not
necessarily compact) 3-manifold $M$ that is not realizable as a connected sum
$(S^1\times S^2) # M'$. This result for compact manifolds was first stated by
Hoste and Przytycki. They referred to the works of McCullough for the idea of
the proof, however to the best of our knowledge the proof of this fundamental
fact was not given in literature. Our proof is based on different ideas. For
$M=(S^1\times S^2) # M'$ we construct $K$ in $M$ such that $|K|=2\neq \infty$.

(HER) is proposed, for the electrochemical reduction of hydrogen in the
presence of bisulfate on platinum(111). The formation of this compound, a
regular 2 dimensional honeycomb ice lattice, occurs by a first order phase
transitions that involves the reorientation of water molecules. The model is
analyzed using new and simple effective cluster approach which highlights the
relevant transitions in system. This method is based on the cluster variation
method used successfully in our previous work on the UPD of Cu onto Au(111),
and permits us to explore a large region of parameter space, an essential
feature to study this complex system. The theory makes full use of the
properties of the diffuse layer: The water molecule is reoriented as the
potential is changed. For positive potentials it forms linear chains which are
responsible for the $\sqrt 3 \times \sqrt 7$ structure of the sulfate observed
by STM. At negative potentials water turns so that its dipole points towards
the Pt. Then it will form a regular honeycomb network of hydrogen bonded
molecules, with the sulfate at the center of the hexagons. Then the bisulfate
is desorbed, leaving the honeycomb HER structure behind. Our model thus
provides an explanation of the well known fact that only 2/3 of the Pt atoms
participate in the electroreduction of the hydrogen. The theory implies
geometrical constraints to the water potential.

  Mechanics'', edited by J. G. Muga, R. Sala Mayato and I. L. Egusquiza",,,,"quant-ph",,"  This chapter reviews several quantities that have been proposed in scattering
theory to characterize the temporal aspects of one dimensional collisions: the
dwell time, the delay time, the decay time, and times characterizing transient
effects or the attainment of stationary conditions. Some aspects of tunnelling
times are also discussed.

  regularity to chaos in quantum systems","8 pages, 2 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  In this paper we continue to develop our approach to the chaoticity
properties of the quantum Hamiltonian systems. Our earlier suggested chaoticity
criterion characterizes the initial symmetry breaking and the destruction of
the corresponding integrals of motion in a perturbed system, which causes the
system's chaotisation. Transition from regularity to chaos in quantum systems
occurs at a certain critical value of the perturbation parameter. In our
previous papers we had to diagonalize the perturbed system's Hamiltonian matrix
in order to estimate this parameter. In the present paper we demonstrate that
the critical perturbation parameter for the transition from regularity to chaos
can be estimated in the framework of the first order perturbation theory. The
values of thus obtained critical parameter are in good agreement with the
results of our previous precise calculations for Hennon-Heiles Hamiltonian and
diamagnetic Kepler problem.

three-level lambda system in laser-cooled rubidium for the first time. When the
coupling field is non-adiabatically switched on using a Pockels cell, transient
probe gain without population inversion is obtained in the presence of
uncoupled absorptions. Our results are supported by three-state computations.
