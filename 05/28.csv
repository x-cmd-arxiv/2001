photometric solutions for detached eclipsing binaries in the Small Magellanic

with an automated version of the Wilson-Devinney program. By fitting mock
catalogs of eclipsing binaries we find that the normalized stellar radii
(particularly their sum) and the surface brightness ratio are accurately
described by the fitted parameters and estimated standard errors, despite
various systematic uncertainties. In many cases these parameters are well
constrained. In addition we find that systems exhibiting complete eclipses can
be reliably identified where the fractional standard errors in the radii are
small. We present two quantitatively selected sub-samples of eclipsing binaries
that will be excellent distance indicators. These can be used both for
computation of the distance to the SMC and to probe its structure. One
particularly interesting binary has a very well determined solution, exhibits
complete eclipses, and is comprised of well detached G-type, class $II$ giants.

unique constraint on cosmological characteristics, independent of Lambda and
biasing, such as the cosmological matter density parameter Omega_m and the
convergence of bulk flows on large scales. Significant progress towards
incorporating non-linear dynamics and improvements of velocity field
reconstruction techniques have led to a rigorous control of errors and much
refined cosmic flow analyses. Current investigations favor low-amplitude (< 250
km/s) bulk flows on the largest scales (< ~100 Mpc/h) probed reliably by
existing redshift-distance surveys, consistent with favored LambdaCDM
cosmogonies. Tidal field analyses also suggest that the Shapley Concentration,
located behind the Great Attractor (GA), might play an important dynamical
role, even at the Local Group. Low-amplitude density fluctuations on very large
scales generate the overall large-scale streaming motions while massive
attractors like the GA, and Perseus-Pisces account for smaller scale motions
which are superposed on the large-scale flow. Likelihood analyses of galaxy
PVs, in the framework of flat CDM cosmology, now provide tight constraints of
Omega_m = 0.35 +/- 0.05. A four-fold size increase of our data base is expected
in the next 4-5 years with the completion of next generation FP/TF surveys and
automated supernovae searches within 20,000 km/s.

  Starbursts and Implications for Starburst-Active Galactic Nucleus Connection","10 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.1086/322398",,"astro-ph",,"  We explore the formation of dusty gas walls induced by a circumnuclear
starburst around an AGN. We concentrate our attention on the role of the
radiation force by a starburst as well as an AGN, where the effects of optical
depth of dusty gas are taken into consideration. In two-dimensional
axisymmetric space, we analyze the configuration and the stability of
geometrically thin walls which are in balance between radiation pressure and
gravity. As a result, it is shown that the radiation force by the circumnuclear
starburst works to stabilize optically thick walls surrounding the nucleus. In
the case of a brighter starburst with a fainter AGN, there form double walls,
an inner one of which is located between the nucleus and the circumnuclear
starburst, and an outer one of which enshrouds both the starburst regions and
the nucleus. The total extinction (Av) of both walls turns out to be ~10 for a
brighter starburst. As a consequence, double walls could heavily obscure the
nucleus to make the AGN type 2. The outer wall may provide an explanation for
the recent indications for large-scale obscuring materials in Seyfert 2's.
Also, it is predicted that the AGN type is shifts from type 2 to type 1 in
several times 10^7 yr according to the stellar evolution in the starburst. In
contrast, if the AGN itself is much brighter than the starburst as a quasar is,
then neither wall forms regardless of the starburst activity and the nucleus is
likely to be identified as type 1. To conclude, the radiatively-supported gas
walls could be responsible for the putative correlation between AGN type and
the starbursts, whereby Seyfert 2 galaxies are more frequently associated with
circumnuclear starbursts than type 1, whereas quasars are mostly observed as
type 1 regardless of star-forming activity in the host galaxies.

the K-band Period-Luminosity (PLK) relation of RR Lyrae stars are presented. We
show that for each given metal content the predicted PLK is marginally
dependent on uncertainties of the stellar mass and/or luminosity. Then, by
considering the RR Lyrae masses suggested by evolutionary computations for the
various metallicities, we obtain that the predicted infrared magnitude M_K over
the range 0.0001< Z <0.02 is given by the relation
MK=0.568-2.071logP+0.087logZ-0.778logL/Lo, with a rms scatter of 0.032 mag.
Therefore, by allowing the luminosities of RR Lyrae stars to vary within the
range covered by current evolutionary predictions for metal-deficient (0.0001<
Z <0.006) horizontal branch models, we eventually find that the infrared
Period-Luminosity- Metallicity (PLZK) relation is
MK=0.139-2.071(logP+0.30)+0.167logZ, with a total intrinsic dispersion of 0.037
mag. As a consequence, the use of such a PLZK relation should constrain within
+-0.04 mag the infrared distance modulus of field and cluster RR Lyrae
variables, provided that accurate observations and reliable estimates of the
metal content are available. Moreover, we show that the combination of K and V
measurements can supply independent information on the average luminosity of RR
Lyrae stars, thus yielding tight constraints on the input physics of stellar
evolution computations. Finally, for globular clusters with a sizable sample of
first overtone variables, the reddening can be estimated by using the PLZK
relation together with the predicted MV-logP relation at the blue edge of the

Mixing episodes called third dredge-up enrich the photosphere with newly
synthesized C12 in the He-rich zone, and this is the source of the high
observed ratio between carbon and oxygen (C/O > 1 by number). Our spectroscopic
abundance estimates confirm that, in agreement with the general understanding
of the late evolutionary stages of low and intermediate mass stars, carbon
enrichment is accompanied by the appearance of s-process elements in the
photosphere. We discuss the details of the observations and of the derived
abundances, focusing in particular on rubidium, a neutron-density sensitive
element, and on the s-elements Sr, Y and Zr belonging to the first s-peak. The
critical reaction branching at Kr85, which determines the relative enrichment
of the studied species, is discussed. Subsequently, we compare our data with
recent models for s-processing in Thermally Pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch
stars, at metallicities relevant for our sample. A remarkable agreement between
model predictions and observations is found. Thanks to the different neutron
density prevailing in low and intermediate mass stars, comparison with the
models allows us to conclude that most C(N) stars are of low mass (M < 3Mo). We
also analyze the C12/C13 ratios measured, showing that most of them cannot be
explained by canonical stellar models. We discuss how this fact would require
the operation of an ad hoc additional mixing, currently called Cool Bottom

investigate the persistent current and its fluctuations in a ring with an
in-line quantum dot with an Aharonov-Bohm flux through the hole of the ring.
The Coulomb blockade leads to persistent current peaks at values of the gate
voltage at which two charge states of the dot have the same free energy. We
couple the structure to an external circuit and investigate the effect of the
zero-temperature (vacuum fluctuations) on the ground state of the ring. We find
that the ground state of the ring undergoes a crossover from a state with an
average persistent current much larger than the (time-dependent) mean squared
fluctuations to a state with a small average persistent current and large mean
squared fluctuations. We discuss the spectral density of charge fluctuations

particle-reinforced elastomers at finite strains. An amorphous rubbery polymer
is treated as a network of long chains linked by permanent junctions (chemical
crosslinks, entanglements and filler particles). A strand between two
neighboring junctions is thought of as a sequence of mers whose motion is
restricted to some tube by surrounding macromolecules. Unlike the conventional
approach that presumes the cross-section of the tube to be constant, we
postulate that its radius strongly depends on the longitudinal coordinate. This
implies that a strand may be modeled as a sequence of segments whose thermal
motion is totally frozen by the environment (bottle-neck points of the tube)
bridged by threads of mers which go through all possible configurations during
the characteristic time of a test. Thermal fluctuations affect the tube's
radius, which results in freezing and activation of regions with high molecular
mobility (RHMs). The viscoelastic response of an elastomer is associated with
thermally activated changes in the number of RHMs in strands. Stress-strain
relations for a rubbery polymer at finite strains and kinetic equations for the
concentrations of RHMs are developed by using the laws of thermodynamics. At
small strains these relations are reduced to the conventional integral
constitutive equation in linear viscoelasticity with a novel scaling law for
relaxation times. The governing equation is determined by 5 adjustable
parameters which are found by fitting experimental data in tensile dynamic
tests on a carbon black filled natural rubber vulcanizate.

truncation or clipping of sample values which lie in the outlier part of the

three-dimensional O(4) and O(2) models. The approach of these functions to the
infinite-volume scaling functions is studied in detail on the critical and
pseudocritical lines. For this purpose we determine the pseudocritical line in
two different ways. We find that the asymptotic form of the finite-size-scaling
functions is already reached at small values of the scaling variable. A
comparison with QCD lattice data for two flavours of staggered fermions shows a
similar finite-size behaviour which is compatible with that of the spin models.

for neutrino mass suppression, do not work out anymore and for realistic model
building some new ideas are needed. In this paper we suggest mechanism,
different from existing ones, which provides natural suppression of the
neutrino masses. The mechanism is realized through extended scalars of 4, 5 or
6 dimensional $SU(2)_L$ multiplets. Scenario, with fundamental mass scale $M_f$
in a $\sim 10^{3}$ TeV range, requires 4-plets guaranteeing neutrino masses
$\stackrel{<}{\sim}1$ eV. For theories with $M_f= few \cdot 10$ TeV 5-plets
should be involved, while in scenarios with $M_f=$ few TeV, 6-plets could be
efficient.
  The considered mechanism could be successfully applied also for
supersymmetric theories, building scenarios with various values of low $M_f$.
  Within considered models we also address the question of gauge coupling
unification. For low scale unification, existence of compact extra dimensions
turns out to be crucial. Due to additional scalar multiplets, some new examples
of unification are found for both - non SUSY and SUSY cases. Within non SUSY
scenarios introduced $SU(2)_L$ scalars take advantage and are important for
successful unification.

fine structure constant at LEP and TESLA energies and calculate the effective
fine structure constant. Substantial progress in a precise determination of
this important parameter is a consequence of substantially improved total cross
section measurements by the BES II collaboration and an improved theoretical
understanding. In the standard approach which relies to a large extend on
experimental data we find $\Delta \al_{\rm hadrons}^{(5)}(\mz) = 0.027896 \pm
0.000395$ which yields $\alpha^{-1}(\mz) = 128.907 \pm 0.054$. Another
approach, using the Adler function as a tool to compare theory and experiment,
allows us to to extend the applicability of perturbative QCD in a controlled
manner. The result in this case reads $\Delta\alpha^{(5)}_{\rm had}(M_Z^2) =
0.027730 \pm 0.000209$ and hence $\alpha^{-1}(\mz) = 128.930 \pm 0.029$. At
TESLA energies a new problem shows up with the definition of an effective
charge. A possible solution of the problem is presented. Prospects for further
progress in a precise determination of the effective fine structure constant

corresponds to one generation contains two sets of $\textbf{5}^{*}$'s in SU(5),
so that there are six flavors of lepton doublets and right-handed down-quark
triplets. It is known that the twisting (interchange) among the
$\textbf{5}^{*}$ representations may reproduce the observed quark and lepton
mixing matrices. If $E_6$ is directly broken down to $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L
\times U(1)_Y$ and two extra U(1)'s, the extra 3 sets of down-type quarks do
not necessarily decouple from the quark mass matrix, under the appropriate
choice of the U(1) flavor charges on the quark and Higgs fields. Then, by
diagonalizing the 6 $\times$ 6 down-quark mass matrix, we find a certain set of
parameters, in which the twisting between a pair of the right-handed
down-quarks occurs naturally, reproducing the reasonable values for the $d$-,
$s$- and $b$-quark masses, and for $V_{ud}$, $V_{us}$, $V_{cd}$, $V_{cs}$ and

mixings among the SM neutrinos, it is not possible to reconcile all these

when embedded in extra dimensions in a minimal way can account for all the

  First, the theoretical context and the motivations for this study are
discussed. In short, the hypercharge axion is introduced to explain the
dominance of matter over antimatter in the universe and the existence of
large-scale magnetic fields.
  Second, the phenomenological properties are analyzed and the distinguishing
marks are underlined. These are basically the products of photons and $Z^0$s
with high transverse momenta and invariant mass equal to that of the axion.
  Third, the simulation is carried out with two photons producing the axion
which decays into $Z^0$s and/or photons. The event simulation is run through
the simulator ATLFAST of ATLAS (A Toroidal Large Hadron Collider ApparatuS) at
CERN.
  Finally, the characteristics of the axion decay are analyzed and the criteria
for detection are presented. A study of the background is also included. The
result is that for certain values of the axion mass and the mass scale (both in
the order of a TeV), the hypercharge axion could be detected in ATLAS.
