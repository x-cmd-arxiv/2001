from a WFPC2 snapshot survey in the V and I-bands. Of these 34 galaxies, 29
have measurable globular cluster systems. The mean color of the GCSs of
individual galaxies vary from V-I=0.85 mag to V-I=1.17 mag. The average color
of GCSs in all 29 S0 galaxies, V-I=1.00 +/- 0.07 mag, is similar to the value
of V-I=1.04 +/- 0.04 derived for ellipticals in a companion paper. The mean
metallicity of a cluster system is correlated to the luminosity (or mass) of
the host galaxy, but is not dependent on the Hubble type. Our measurements of
the local specific frequency, on the other hand, confirm that the cluster
formation efficiency is a function of Hubble type. The mean local specific
frequency of our sample within the WFPC2 field-of-view is 1.0 +/- 0.6, lower
than S_(N Local)=2.4 +/- 1.8 derived for ellipticals in a similar analysis.
Although we are able to confirm a bimodal color distribution in only one galaxy
from the shallow 'snapshot' images analyzed in this paper statistical tests
suggest that 10-20% of S0s are bimodal it at the present level of photometric
accuracy. There are no significant trends in GCS properties with membership or
location of the S0 host in a galaxy cluster. We have measured the turnover
luminosity of the globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF) for the richest
few GCSs and find the GCLF distances to be in agreement with other estimates.
The globular clusters in S0 galaxies have average half-light radii of ~2.6 pc
which is similar to that of other galaxies, including our own.

the spatial distribution of the O II and [O III] lines. The [O III] emission
follows the H-beta emission measure; however, the O II emission peaks closer to
the central star. This suggests that radiative recombination may not be the
primary mechanism for producing the O II lines. O+2 abundances derived from O
II lines are 5-10 times larger than those derived from [O III] in the region
within 20"" of the central star, but agree to within 0.2-0.3 dex outside this
region. The [O III] electron temperature rises smoothly from about 10,000 K in
the outer shell to about 12,000 K in the center; we see no evidence for a
temperature jump that would be associated with a shock. If temperature
fluctuations are responsible for the discrepancy in O+2 abundances, the average
temperature would have to be approximately 6,500 K in the He$^{+2}$ zone and
about 9,000 K in the outer shell in order to force the [O III]-derived
abundance to equal that derived from O II. We therefore argue that temperature
fluctuations can not explain the abundance discrepancy. The O II emission does
not peak at the locations of dusty knots, creating difficulties for models
which explain the O II - [O III] discrepancy by density fluctuations. We
examine the possibility high-temperature dielectronic recombination in a
central hot bubble enhances the O II line strengths in the central nebula.
However, comparison of recombination rates with collisional excitation rates
shows that the increase in recombination emission due to dielectronic
recombination at T ~ 10^5 K is not sufficient to overcome the increase in [O
III] emission. (Abridged)

interactions with the interstellar medium. With the completion of EGRET

We systematically estimate the expected diffuse gamma-ray flux from Local Group
galaxies, and determine their detectability by new generation gamma-ray
observatories such as GLAST. For each galaxy, the expected gamma-ray flux
depends only on its total gas content and its cosmic ray flux. We present a
method for calculating cosmic ray flux in these galaxies in terms of the
observed rate of supernova explosions, where cosmic ray acceleration is
believed to take place. The difficulty in deriving accurate supernova rates
from observational data is a dominant uncertainty in our calculations. We
estimate the gamma-ray flux for Local Group galaxies and find that our

  symposium",,"10.1063/1.1419400",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a theory of ultrarelativistic collisionless shocks based on the
relativistic kinetic two-stream instability. We demonstrate that the shock
front is unstable to the generation of small-scale, randomly tangled magnetic
fields. These fields are strong enough to scatter the energetic incoming (in
the shock frame) protons and electrons over pitch angle and, therefore, to
convert their kinetic energy of bulk motion into heat with very high
efficiency. This validates the use of MHD approximation and the shock jump
conditions in particular. The effective collisions are also necessary for the
diffusive Fermi acceleration of electrons to operate and produce an observed
power-law. Finally, these strong (sub-equipartition) magnetic fields are also
required for the efficient synchrotron-type radiation emission from the shocks.
  The predicted magnetic fields have an impact on polarization properties of
the observed radiation (e.g., a linear polarization from a jet-like ejecta and
polarization scintillations in radio for a spherical one) and on its spectrum.
We present an analytical theory of jitter radiation, which is emitted when the
magnetic field is correlated on scales smaller then the gyration (Larmor)
radius of the accelerated electrons. A composite jitter+synchrotron model of
GRB $\gamma$-ray emission from internal shocks is capable of resolving many
puzzles of GRB spectra, such as the violation of the ``line of death'', sharp
spectral breaks, and multiple spectral components seen in some bursts (good
examples are GRB910503, GRB910402, etc.). We stress that simultaneous detection
of both spectral components opens a way to a precise diagnostics of the
conditions in GRB shocks. We also discuss the relation of our results to other
systems, such as internal shocks in blazars, radio lobes, and supernova shocks.

described by the unified freezeout conditions of fixed energy/particle $\simeq
1$GeV. The statistical model within the canonical formulation of strangeness
conservation provides a framework to describe the observed enhancement of
(multi)strange particles from p+A to A+A collisions measured at the SPS energy
and predicts that this enhancement should be larger for decreasing collision
energy. However, only at the SPS and RHIC chemical freezeout temperature is
consistent within error with the critical value required for deconfinement and
simultaneously strangeness is uncorrelated and distributed in the whole volume

measurements will allow to check the three neutrino scheme with mass
degeneracy, moreover, the possibility appears to measure the CP-violating
Majorana phase. Effects in the four neutrino schemes which can also explain the
LSND data are strongly restricted by the results of Bugey and CHOOZ oscillation
experiments: Apart from bending of the spectrum and the shift of the end point
one expects appearance of small kink of ($ < 2% $) size or suppressed tail
after bending of the spectrum with rate below 2 % of the expected rate for zero
neutrino mass. We consider possible implications of future beta decay
experiments for the neutrino mass spectrum, the determination of the absolute
scale of neutrino mass and for establishing the nature of neutrinos. We show
that beta decay measurements in combination with data from the oscillation and
double beta decay experiments will allow to establish the structure of the
scheme (hierarchical or non-hierarchical), the type of the hierarchy or
ordering of states (normal or inverted) and to measure the relative
CP-violating phase in the solar pair of states.

there are $n^{1-2\pi b+o(1)}$ points $x \in {\bf Z}^2$ for which
$L_n^{X}(x)L_n^{X'}(x)\geq b^2 (\log n)^4$. This is the discrete counterpart of
our main result, that for any $a<1$, the Hausdorff dimension of the set of {\it
thick intersection points} $x$ for which $\limsup_{r \to 0} {\mathcal
I}(x,r)/(r^2|\log r|^4)=a^2$, is almost surely $2-2a$. Here ${\mathcal I}(x,r)$
is the projected intersection local time measure of the disc of radius $r$
centered at $x$ for two independent planar Brownian motions run till time 1.
The proofs rely on a `multi-scale refinement' of the second moment method. In
addition, we also consider analogous problems where we replace one of the
Brownian motions by a transient stable process, or replace the disc of radius
$r$ centered at $x$ by $x+rK$ for general sets $K$.

  Quasispecies Model of Biological Evolution, BioSystems, 66, No. 3, 105 thru

information. Nevertheless, applications such as evolutionary theory demand
consideration of precisely this aspect of information, a need that has
motivated a largely unsuccessful search for a suitable measure of an ""amount of
meaning"". This paper represents an attempt to move beyond this impasse, based
on the observation that the meaning of a message can only be understood
relative to its receiver. Positing that the semantic value of information is
its usefulness in making an informed decision, we define pragmatic information
as the information gain in the probability distributions of the receiver's
actions, both before and after receipt of a message in some pre-defined
ensemble. We then prove rigorously that our definition is the only one that
satisfies obvious desiderata, such as the additivity of information from
logically independent messages. This definition, when applied to the
information ""learned"" by the time evolution of a process, defies the intuitions
of the few previous researchers thinking along these lines by being monotonic
in the uncertainty that remains after receipt of the message, but non-monotonic
in the Shannon entropy of the input ensemble. It then follows that the
pragmatic information of the genetic ""messages"" in an evolving population is a
global Lyapunov function for Eigen's quasi-species model of biological
evolution. A concluding section argues that a theory such as ours must
explicitly acknowledge purposeful action, or ""agency"", in such diverse fields
as evolutionary theory and finance.

we study how some species of molecules are preserved over cell generations and
play an important role in controlling the growth of a cell. We consider a model
consisting of protocells. Each protocell contains two mutually catalyzing
molecule species ($X$ and $Y$), each of which has catalytically active and
inactive types. One of the species $Y$ is assumed to have a slower synthesis
speed. Through divisions of the protocells, the system reaches and remains in a
state in which there are only a few active $Y$ and almost no inactive $Y$
molecules in most protocells, through selection of very rare fluctuations. In
this state, the active $Y$ molecules are shown to control the behavior of the
protocell. The minority molecule species act as the information carrier, due to
the relatively discrete nature of its population, in comparison with the
majority species which behaves statistically in accordance with the law of
large numbers. The relevance of this minority controlled state to evolvability
is discussed.

to the passage through resonance. It is followed by oscillations resulting from

and compared. The case of two non-canonical observables is breafly outlined.
Stanfard SU(1,1) and SU(2) group-related coherent states can be defined as
states that minimize Schroedinger inequality for the three pairs of generators
simultaneously. The symmetry of the Heisenberg and Schroedinger relations is
also discussed, and two natural generalizations to the cases of several

temporal evolution of the bright soliton by examining its waveshape propagating
along the space coordinate axis. We develop a singular theory. Equations
governing the evolution of the parameters of the bright soliton in the slow

  In the present first part of our investigation we consider the time-dependent
or Hamiltonian approach to bundle description of relativistic quantum
mechanics. In it the wavefunctions are replaced by (state) liftings of paths or
sections along paths of a suitably chosen vector bundle over space-time whose
(standard) fibre is the space of the wavefunctions. Now the quantum evolution
is described as a linear transportation (by means of the evolution transport
along paths in the space-time) of the state liftings/sections in the (total)
bundle space. The equations of these transportations turn to be the bundle
versions of the corresponding relativistic wave equations.
