implications of such a model on structure formation, looking at its impact on
matter perturbations and CMB anisotropies. We find that the model only deviates
from $\Lambda$CDM and minimally coupled theories at late times, and is well
fitted to current observational data. The signature left by the coupling, when
it breaks degeneracy at late times, presents a valuable opportunity to
constrain non-minimal couplings given the wealth of new observational data

photoionizing the medium with its afterglow, a GRB explosion drives a blast

determining the number of undiscovered contact binary systems falling below
photometric detection thresholds and thus lost to statistics, can serve as a
tool in determination of the mass-ratio distribution, Q(q), which is very
important for understanding of the evolution of contact binaries. Calculations
of the expected A(a) show that it tends to converge to a mass-ratio dependent
constant value for a->0. Strong dependence of A(a) on Q(q) can be used to
determine the latter distribution, but the technique is limited by the presence
of unresolved visual companions and by blending in crowded areas of the sky.
The bright-star sample to 7.5 magnitude is too small for an application of the
technique while the the Baade's Window sample from the OGLE project may suffer
stronger blending; thus the present results are preliminary and illustrative
only. Estimates based on the Baade's Window data from the OGLE project, for
amplitudes a>0.3 mag. where the statistics appear to be complete allowing
determination of Q(q) over 0.12<q<1, suggest a steep increase of Q(q) with
q->0. The mass-ratio distribution can be approximated by a power law, either
Q(q)~(1-q)^a1 with a1=6+/-2 or Q(q)~q^b1, with b1=-2+/-0.5, with a slight
preference for the former form. Both forms must be modified by the
theoretically expected cut-off caused by a tidal instability at about q_min
0.07-0.1. An expected maximum in Q(q), is expected to be mapped into a local

afterglow of GRB000214. We pose the importance to seek the physically natural
environment around GRB000214. For the reproduction of the observation, we need
the ring-like remnant around the progenitor like that of SN 1987A produced by
the mass-loss of the progenitor and the fireball spread over in every
directions. The observation of GRB000214, in which the continuum power law
spectrum decreased faster than the line, motivated us to consider the two
independent systems for the line emission and the continuum spectrum. At first,
the continuum spectrum can be fitted by the afterglow emission of the fireball
pointing toward the observer which does not collide with the ring because the
emission of GRB and the afterglow are highly collimated to the observer by the
relativistic beaming effect. Secondly, the line can be fitted by the
fluorescence of the Fe atoms in the ring illuminated by the X-ray afterglow.
The significance of this study is that our model may constrain strongly the GRB
model. Although the Supranova model assumes the extreme-ring-like remnant
produced by the usual supernova explosion, this may not be probable. It is
because the supernova remnants are known to be shell-like. The model also
assumes two steps of explosions, on the other hand, we need only one explosion
of the progenitor. In this sense, our scenario is more natural. Moreover, in
the numerical simulations of Hypernova, the jet of the opening angle of only 1
degree is generated. In our model, the fireball which spreads over in every
directions reconciles with the observation of 1 percent of the polarization in
the observation of SN1998bw which showed the explosion might not be so
collimated.

Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) of a 450 Hz quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO)
in the hard X-ray flux from the galactic microquasar GRO J1655-40. This is the
highest frequency QPO modulation seen to date from a black hole. The QPO is
detected only in the hard X-ray band above 13 keV. It is both strong and
narrow, with a typical rms amplitude of 4.5 % in the 13 - 27 keV range, and a
width of 40 Hz (FWHM). For two observations in which we detect the 450 Hz QPO a
previously known 300 Hz QPO is also observed in the 2 - 13 keV band. We show
that these two QPO sometimes appear simultaneously, thus demonstrating the
first detection of a pair of high frequency QPO in a black hole system. Prior
to this, pairs of high frequency QPO have only been detected in neutron star
systems. GRO J1655-40 is one of only a handful of black hole systems with a
good dynamical mass constraint. For a non-rotating black hole with mass between
5.5 - 7.9 solar masses, the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) ranges from
45 - 70 km. For any mass in this range the radius at which the orbital
frequency reaches 450 Hz is less than the ISCO radius, indicating that if the
modulation is caused by Kepler motion, the black hole must have appreciable
spin. If the QPO frequency is set by the orbital frequency of matter at the
ISCO then for this mass range the dimensionless angular momentum lies between
0.15 < j < 0.5. Moreover, if the modulation is caused by oscillation modes in
the disk or Lense-Thirring precession, then this would also require a rapidly
rotating hole. We briefly discuss the implications of our findings for models
of X-ray variability in black holes and neutron stars.

of the Type II SN 1999em. We combine these data with high-quality optical/IR
photometry beginning only three days after shock breakout, in order to study
the performance of the ``Expanding Photosphere Method'' (EPM) in the
determination of distances. With this purpose we develop a technique to measure
accurate photospheric velocities by cross-correlating observed and model
spectra. The application of this technique to SN 1999em shows that we can reach
an average uncertainty of 11% in velocity from an individual spectrum. Our
analysis shows that EPM is quite robust to the effects of dust. In particular,
the distances derived from the VI filters change by only 7% when the adopted
visual extinction in the host galaxy is varied by 0.45 mag. The superb time
sampling of the BVIZJHK light-curves of SN 1999em permits us to study the
internal consistency of EPM and test the dilution factors computed from
atmosphere models for Type II plateau supernovae. We find that, in the first
week since explosion, the EPM distances are up to 50% lower than the average,
possibly due the presence of circumstellar material. Over the following 65
days, on the other hand, our tests lend strong credence to the atmosphere
models, and confirm previous claims that EPM can produce consistent distances
without having to craft specific models to each supernova. This is particularly
true for the VI filters which yield distances with an internal consistency of
4%. From the whole set of BVIZJHK photometry, we obtain an average distance of
7.5+/-0.5 Mpc, where the quoted uncertainty (7%) is a conservative estimate of

potential difference across a magnetic dielectric constructed from wax and
steel balls. Their measurement has long been regarded as a verification of this
prediction. In 1995 Pelligrini and Swift questioned the theoretical basis of
experiment. In particular, they pointed out that it is not obvious that a
rotating medium may be treated as if each point in the medium is locally
inertial. They calculated the effect in the rotating frame and predicted a
potential different from both Wilson's theory and experiment. Subsequent
analysis of the experiment suggests that Wilson's experiment does not
distinguish between the two predictions due to the fact that their composite
steel-wax cylinder is conductive in the regions of magnetization. We report
measurements of the radial voltage difference across various rotating
dielectric cylinders, including a homogeneous magnetic material (YIG), to
unambiguously test the competing calculations. Our results are compatible with
the traditional treatment of the effect using a co-moving locally inertial

around a~0.1fm for thin link staggered fermion actions to show the expected

look at the under-lying Fock space structure. This exercise becomes all the
more important in order to provide a general classification scheme for various
forms of statistics, and establish interconnections among them whenever it is
possible. We formulate a theory of generalized Fock spaces, which has a three
tired structure consisting of Fock space, statistics and algebra. This general
formalism unifies various forms of statistics and algebras, which were earlier
considered to describe different systems. Besides, the formalism allows us to
construct many new kinds of quantum statistics and the associated algebras of
creation and destruction operators. Some of these are: orthostatistics, null
statistics or statistics of frozen order, quantum group based statistics and
its many avatars, and `doubly-infinite' statistics. The emergence of new forms
of quantum statistics for particles interacting with singular potential is also
highlighted.
