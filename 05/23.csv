believed to contribute significantly to the soft X-ray flux of the Anomalous
X-ray Pulsars. We compare the detailed predictions of models of the surface
emission from a magnetar to the observed properties of AXPs. In particular, we
focus on the combination of their luminosities and energy-dependent pulsed
fractions. We use the results of recent calculations for strongly magnetized
atmospheres to obtain the angle- and energy-dependence of the surface emission.
We include in our calculations the effects of general relativistic photon
transport and interstellar extinction. We find that the combination of the
large pulsed fractions and the high luminosities of AXPs cannot be accounted
for by surface emission from a magnetar with two antipodal hot regions or a
temperature distribution characteristic of a magnetic dipole. This result is
robust for reasonable neutron star radii, for the range of magnetic field
strengths inferred from the observed spin down rates, and for surface
temperatures consistent with the spectral properties of AXPs. Models with a
single hot emitting region can reproduce the observations, provided that the
distance to one of the sources is ~30% less than the current best estimate, and
allowing for systematic uncertainties in the spectral fit of a second source.
Finally, the thermal emission models with antipodal emission geometry predict a
characteristic strong increase of the pulsed fraction with photon energy, which
is apparently inconsistent with the current data. The energy-dependence of the
pulsed fraction in the models with one hot region shows a wider range of
behavior and can be consistent with the existing data. Upcoming high-resolution
observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton will provide a conclusive test.

stellar component, and their overall colors are quite blue ((U-B)_rest < 0).
  Both Type-1 and Type-2 BSCs have internal velocity dispersions measured from
emission lines sigma < 80$ km/sec and estimated dynamical masses of only a few

nearly five orders of magnitude in luminosity. The RXTE spectra are dominated
by a power-law component and a comparatively weak soft component was also
detected for the first two observations. The source made a transition to the
canonical hard state near a luminosity of 9E36 erg/s over several observations
as evidenced by a drop in the flux of the soft component in the RXTE energy
band and a hardening of the power-law component to a photon index near 1.6. The
power-law did not exhibit this behavior for the previous XTE J1550-564
outburst. For some observations, we detect a high energy cutoff and find that
the cutoff is more significant and at lower energy during the transition than
in the hard state. The cutoff in the hard state is at higher energy than has
been seen for most previous accreting BHCs. The Chandra spectrum provides
evidence for spectral evolution after the hard state transition. It is well,
but not uniquely, described by a power-law with a photon index of
2.30^{+0.41}_{-0.48} (90% confidence) and interstellar absorption.
Advection-dominated accretion flow models predict gradual spectral softening as
the luminosity drops, but our observations do not allow us to determine if the
spectral evolution is gradual or sudden. The lowest luminosity we measure for
XTE J1550-564 with Chandra is 5E32 erg/s (0.5-7 keV, for a distance of 4 kpc).

useful upper limit on this quantity.

phase space into regular and chaotic orbit regions which is shown to play an
important role in shaping the stellar velocity distribution in the Solar
neighbourhood. A detailed orbital analysis within an analytical 2D rotating
barred potential reveals that this splitting is mainly dictated by the value of
the Hamiltonian H and the bar induced resonances. Test particle and N-body
simulations reveal how the decoupled evolution of the disc distribution
function in the two kind of regions and the process of chaotic mixing lead to
overdensities in the H>H_12 chaotic part of the u-v velocity distributions
outside corotation, where H_12 is the effective potential at the Lagrangian
points L_1/2. In particular, for realistic space positions of the Sun near or
slightly beyond the outer Lindblad resonance and if u is defined positive
towards the anti-centre, the eccentric quasi-periodic orbits trapped around the
stable x1(1) orbits - i.e. the bar-aligned closed orbits which asymptotically
become circular at larger distances - produce a broad u<0 regular arc in
velocity space extending within the H>H_12 zone, whereas the corresponding u>0
region appears as an overdensity of chaotic orbits forced to avoid that arc.
This chaotic overdensity provides an original interpretation, distinct from the
anti-bar elongated quasi-periodic orbit interpretation proposed by Dehnen
(2000), for the prominent stream of high asymmetric drift and predominantly
outward moving stars clearly emerging from the Hipparcos data. The effects of
spiral arms and of molecular clouds are also briefly discussed within this
context.

all seven objects are Ly-alpha emitting galaxies. Deep images also obtained
with the VLT in the B and I bands show that five of the seven galaxies have
very faint continuum fluxes (I(AB) approx. 26.8 and B(AB) approx. 27.3). The
star formation rates of these seven galaxies estimated from the rest-frame UV
continuum around 2000AA, as probed by the I-band detections, as well as from
the Ly-alpha luminosities, are 1-4 M_sun yr^{-1}. This is 1-3 orders of
magnitude lower than for other known populations of star-forming galaxies at
similar redshifts (the Lyman-Break galaxies and the sub-mm selected sources).
The inferred density of the objects is high, 16+-4 per arcmin^2 per unit
redshift. This is consistent with the integrated luminosity function for
Lyman-Break galaxies down to R=27 if the fraction of Ly-alpha emitting galaxies
is approx. 70% at the faint end of the luminosity function. However, if this
fraction is 20% as reported for the bright end of the luminosity function then
the space density in this field is significantly larger (by a factor of 3.5)
than expected from the luminosity function for Lyman-Break galaxies in the
HDF-North. This would be an indication that at least some radio quiet QSOs at
high redshift reside in overdense environments or that the faint end slope of
the high redshift luminosity function has been underestimated. These
observations show that Ly-alpha emission is an efficient method by which to
probe the faint end of the luminosity function at high redshifts.

Survey (SDSS). Morphological classification is carried out by correlating
results of several human classifiers. Our purpose is to examine the statistical
properties of color indices, scale lengths, and concentration indices as
functions of morphology for the SDSS photometric system. We find that $u'-g'$,
$g'-r'$, and $r'-i'$ colors of SDSS galaxies match well with those expected
from the synthetic calculation of spectroscopic energy distribution of template
galaxies and with those transformed from $UBVR_CI_C$ color data of nearby
galaxies. The agreement is somewhat poor, however, for $i'-z'$ color band with
a discrepancy of $0.1-0.2$ mag. With the aid of the relation between surface
brightness and radius obtained by Kent (1985), we estimate the averages of the
effective radius of early type galaxies and the scale length of exponential
disks both to be 2.6 kpc for $L^*$ galaxies. We find that the half light radius
of galaxies depends slightly on the color bands, consistent with the expected
distribution of star-forming regions for late type galaxies and with the known
color gradient for early type galaxies. We also show that the (inverse)
concentration index, defined by the ratio of the half light Petrosian radius to
the 90% light Petrosian radius, correlates tightly with the morphological type;
this index allows us to classify galaxies into early (E/S0) and late (spiral
and irregular) types, allowing for a 15-20% contamination from the opposite
class compared with eye-classified morphology.

on the assumption that we know the equation of state for all mass-energy other
than normal pressureless matter; popular models are based on either the
cosmological constant or on the more general quintessence formulation. But this
assertion also depends on a number of other assumptions, implicit in the
derivation of the standard cosmological field equations: large-scale isotropy
and homogeneity, the flatness of the Universe, and the validity of general
relativity on cosmological scales (where it has not been tested). A detailed
examination of the effects of these assumptions on the interplay between the
luminosity distance-redshift relation and the acceleration of the Universe is
not possible unless one can define the precise nature of the failure of any
particular assumption. However a simple quantitative investigation is possible
and reveals a number of considerations about the relative importance of the
different assumptions. In this paper we present such an investigation. We find
that the relationship between the distant-redshift relation and the sign of the
deceleration parameter is fairly robust and is unaffected if only one of the
assumptions that we investigate is invalid so long as the deceleration
parameter is not close to zero (it would not be close to zero in the

penetration of the helium flash driven convective zone into the inner tail of
the extinguishing H-burning shell. As a consequence, protons are mixed into
high-temperature regions triggering a H-burning runaway. The subsequent
dredge-up of matter processed by He and H burning enriches the stellar surface
with large amounts of helium, carbon and nitrogen. Extending previous results
by Hollowell et al. (1990) and Fujimoto et al. (2000), who claimed that the
H-burning runaway is an intrinsic property of extremely metal-poor low-mass
stars, we found that its occurrence depends on additional parameters like the
initial composition and the treatment of various physical processes.
  We perform some comparisons between predicted surface chemical abundances and
observational measurements for extremely metal-deficient stars. As in previous
investigations, our results disclose that although the described scenario
provides a good qualitative agreement with observations, considerable
discrepancies still remain. They may be due to a more complex evolutionary path
of `real' stars, and/or some shortcomings in current evolutionary models.
  In addition, we analyze the evolutionary properties after the He core flash,
during both the central and shell He-burning phases, allowing us to deduce some
interesting differences between models whose Red Giant Branch progenitor has
experienced the H-flash and canonical models. In particular, the Asymptotic
Giant Branch evolution of extremely metal-deficient stars and the occurrence of
thermal pulses are strongly affected by the previous RGB evolution.

different behaviors as regards the resistance changes, namely the tendency to
decrease the resistance by annealing at T = 200 degree C, but to increase the

($t=t_i$). Using $Y_i$ to fix the radial coordinate and the topology
(homeomorphic class) of $\Ti$, and scaling the time evolution in terms of an
adimensional scale factor $y=Y/Y_i$, we show that the dynamics, regularity
conditions and geometric features of the models are determined by $\rho_i$,
$\Ri$ and by suitably constructed volume averages and contrast functions
expressible in terms of invariant scalars defined in $\Ti$. These quantities
lead to a straightforward characterization of initial conditions in terms of
the nature of the inhomogeneity of $\Ti$, as density and/or curvature
overdensities (``lumps'') and underdensities (''voids'') around a symmetry
center. In general, only models with initial density and curvature lumps evolve
without shell crossing singularities, though special classes of initial
conditions, associated with a simmultaneous big bang, allow for a regular
evolution for initial density and curvature voids. Specific restrictions are
found so that a regular evolution for $t>t_i$ is possible for initial voids. A
step-by-step guideline is provided for using the new variables in the

problem of renormalizing interacting models in a transparent way using
dimensional regularization. The evolution is generated by a renormalized
effective Lagrangian which incorporates the dynamics of the mean fields and
their associated fluctuations at one-loop order. We apply our method to two
problems of physical interest: (i) a simple two-field model which exemplifies
applications to reheating in inflation, and (ii) a supersymmetric hybrid
inflation model. This second case is interesting because inflation terminates
via a smooth phase transition which gives rise to a spinodal instability in one
of the fields. We study the evolution of the zero mode of the fields and the
energy density transfer to the fluctuations from the mean fields. We conclude
that back reaction effects can be significant over a wide parameter range. In
particular for the supersymmetric hybrid model we find that particle production
can be suppressed due to these effects.

distinctive experimental signatures. We focus on a class of these that do not
require any form factor information and therefore may be especially suitable
for extracting information on the angles $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ of the unitarity
triangle. The nonfactorizable effects, such as vertex-type and penguin-type
corrections to the two-body b decay and hard spectator corrections to the
3-body decay are calculable in the heavy quark limit. QCD factorization is
applicable when the emitted meson is a light meson or a charmonium. We discuss
the issue of the CPT constraint on partial rate asymmetries. The strong phase
coming from final-state rescattering due to hard gluon exchange between the
final states can induce large rate asymmetries for tree-dominated
color-suppressed modes $(\pi^0,\rho^0,\omega)X_{\bar s}$. The nonfactorizable
hard spectator interactions in the 3-body decay, though phase-space suppressed,
are extremely important for the tree-dominated modes
$(\pi^0,\rho^0,\omega)X_{\bar s}, \phi X$, $J X_s,J X$ and the
penguin-dominated mode $\omega X_{s\bar s}$. In fact, they are dominated by the
hard spectator corrections. Our result for ${\cal B} (B\to J/\psi X_s)$ is in
agreement with experiment. The semi-inclusive decay modes: $B^0_s\to

certain singular spaces in their large volume limit. The approach exploits the
non-commutative structure of D-branes, so the space is described by an
algebraic geometry of non-commutative rings. The paper is devoted to the study
of examples of these algebras. In our study there is an auxiliary commutative
algebraic geometry of the center of the (local) algebras which plays an
important role as the target space geometry where closed strings propagate. The
singularities that are resolved will be the singularities of this auxiliary
geometry. The singularities are resolved by the non-commutative algebra if the
local non-commutative rings are regular. This definition guarantees that
D-branes have a well defined K-theory class. Homological functors also play an
important role. They describe the intersection theory of D-branes and lead to a
formal definition of local quivers at singularities, which can be computed
explicitly for many types of singularities. These results can be interpreted in
terms of the derived category of coherent sheaves over the non-commutative
rings, giving a non-commutative version of recent work by M. Douglas. We also
describe global features like the Betti numbers of compact singular Calabi-Yau
threefolds via global holomorphic sections of cyclic homology classes.

the fractional statistics of point particles which has been shown essential for
our understanding of the fractional quantum Hall effects. Furthermore these
ideas are applied to the study of high Tc superconductivity. We present here an
recently proposed model for fractional spin with the Pauli term. On the other
hand, in D=4 space-time, a Schwarz-type topological gauge theory with
antisymmetric tensor gauge field, namely BF model, is reviewed. Antisymmetric
tensor fields are conjectured as mediator of string interaction. A dimensional
reduction of the previous model provides a (2+1) dimensional topological
theory, which involves a 2-form B and a 0-form $\phi$. Some recent results on
this model are reported. Recently, there have been thoughts of generalizing
unusual statistics to extended objects in others space-time dimensions, and in
particular to the case of strings in four dimensions. In this context,
discussions about fractional spin and antisymmetric tensor field are presented.

parametrizes the gauge invariant operators of the field theory and either side
of the duality is uniquely determined by the other. We follow this same chain

to $SL(2,R)\times U(1)$ and breaks supersymmetry in the sense of $N=4, d=4$
supergravity as well. However, it shares with BR such properties as confinement
of timelike geodesics and discreteness of the energy of test fields on the
geodesically complete manifold. Conformal mechanics governing the radial
geodesic motion coincides with that for a charged particle in the BR background
(a relativistic version of the De Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan model), with the
azimuthal momentum playing the role of a charge. Similarly to the BR case, the
transition from Poincar\'e to global coordinates leads to a redefinition of the
Hamiltonian making the energy spectrum discrete. Although the metric does not
split into a product space even asymptotically, it still admits an
infinite-dimensional extension of $SL(2,R)$ as asymptotic symmetry. The latter
is shown to be given by the product of one copy of the Virasoro algebra and
U(1), the same being valid for the extremal Kerr throat.

equations which generalize the hypergeometric equation of Gauss-Riemann. In a

triples of spectral flags have finitely many orbits of the diagonal action of
the general linear group in the space of solutions. We also construct a scalar
product such that A, B, and C are self-adjoint with respect to it. In the
context of Fuchsian systems, this scalar product becomes a monodromy invariant
complex symmetric bilinear form in the space of solutions.

with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, are shown to provide the
major mechanism for the ideal mixing between pseudoscalar strange and
non-strange quarkonia. As long as 't Hooft's interaction captures most of the
basic features of the axial QCD gluon anomaly, we identify the anomaly as the
main culprit for the appearance of octet flavor symmetry in the anomalous
sectors of the pseudoscalar (and axial vector) mesons. Within this context,
unitary spin is shown to be an accidental symmetry due to anomalous gluon
dynamics rather than a fundamental symmetry in its own right. Though we find
the eta-nucleon coupling constant to obey a Goldberger-Treiman like relation,
the latter does not take its origin from a pole dominance of the induced
pseudoscalar form factor of the octet axial current, but from a subtle
flavor-mixing mechanism that is traced back to instanton dynamics. The model
presented allows for possible generalizations to non-ideal mixing angles and
different values of the meson decay constants in the strange and non-strange
sectors, respectively. Finally, we discuss the issue as to what extent the eta
meson may be considered as a Goldstone boson under the constraints of the
anomaly-produced unitary spin.

considerable theoretical and experimental interest. A particular example of
laser-modified reaction dynamics is laser catalysis, a process in which the
tunneling through a potential barrier is enhanced by transient excitation to a

catalysis on one- and two-dimensional potentials, as a function of the
reactants' collision energy and the laser's central frequency. In agreement
with previous CW results, the reactive lineshapes are Fano-type curves,
resulting from interference between nonradiative tunneling and the optically
assisted pathway. In contrast to the CW process, the power requirements of
pulsed laser catalysis are well within the reach of commonly used pulsed laser
sources, making an experimental realization possible. The laser catalysis
scenario is shown to be equivalent in the ``dressed'' state picture, to
resonant tunneling through a double-barrier potential, admitting perfect
transmission when the incident energy matches a quasibound state of the well
within the barriers. Possible applications for atom optics, solid-state

  equivalence","27 pages, 0 figures","International Journal of Theoretical Physics, 38, 1999, 259",,,"quant-ph",,"  We show that the natural mathematical structure to describe a physical entity
by means of its states and its properties within the Geneva-Brussels approach
is that of a state property system. We prove that the category of state
property systems (and morphisms), SP, is equivalent to the category of closure
spaces (and continuous maps), Cls. We show the equivalence of the 'state
determination axiom' for state property systems with the 'T0 separation axiom'
for closure spaces. We also prove that the category SP0 of state determined
state property systems is equivalent to the category L0 of based complete
lattices. In this sense the equivalence of SP and Cls generalizes the
equivalence of Cls0 and L0, proven in Erne 1984.

  approach","64 pages, 3 figures","International Journal of Theoretical Physics, 38, 1999, 289",,,"quant-ph",,"  We present a general formalism with the aim of describing the situation of an
entity, how it is, how it reacts to experiments, how we can make statistics
with it, and how it changes under the influence of the rest of the universe.
Therefore we base our formalism on the following basic notions: (1) the states
of the entity; they describe the modes of being of the entity, (2) the
experiments that can be performed on the entity; they describe how we act upon
and collect knowledge about the entity, (3) the probabilities; they describe
our repeated experiments and the statistics of these repeated experiments, (4)
the symmetries; they describe the interactions of the entity with the external
world without being experimented upon. Starting from these basic notions we
formulate the necessary derived notions: mixed states, mixed experiments and
events, an eigen closure structure describing the properties of the entity, an
ortho closure structure introducing an orthocomplementation, outcome
determination, experiment determination, state determination and atomicity
giving rise to some of the topological separation axioms for the closures. We
define the notion of sub entity in a general way and identify the morphisms of
our structure. We study specific examples in detail in the light of this
formalism: a classical deterministic entity and a quantum entity described by
the standard quantum mechanical formalism. We present a possible solution to
the problem of the description of sub entities within the standard quantum
mechanical procedure using the tensor product of the Hilbert spaces, by
introducing a new completed quantum mechanics in Hilbert space, were new 'pure'
states are introduced, not represented by rays of the Hilbert space.

  2001",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The influence of losses in the transmission of continuous-variable entangled
light through linear devices such as optical fibers is studied, with special
emphasis on Gaussian states. Upper bounds on entanglement and the distance to
the set of separable Gaussian states are calculated. Compared with the distance
measure, the bounds can substantially overestimate the entanglement and thus do
not show the drastic decrease of entanglement with increasing mean photon
number, as does the distance measure. In particular, it shows that losses give
rise to entanglement saturation, which principally limits the amount of
information that can be transferred quantum mechanically in continuous-variable
teleportation. Even for an initially infinitely squeezed two-mode squeezed
vacuum, high-fidelity teleportation is only possible over distances that are
much smaller than the absorption lengths.

operatorial formulation. This was pioneered by Koopman and von Neumann (KvN) in
the 30's. They basically formalized, via the introduction of a classical
Hilbert space, earlier work of Liouville who had shown that the classical time
evolution can take place via an operator, nowadays known as the Liouville
operator. In this paper we study how to perform the coupling of a point
particle to a gauge field in the KvN version of CM. So we basically implement
at the classical operatorial level the analog of the minimal coupling of QM. We
show that, differently than in QM, not only the momenta but also other
variables have to be coupled to the gauge field. We also analyze in details how
the gauge invariance manifests itself in the Hilbert space of KvN and indicate
the differences with QM. As an application of the KvN method we study the
Landau problem proving that there are many more degeneracies at the classical
operatorial level than at the quantum one. As a second example we go through
the Aharonov-Bohm phenomenon showing that, at the quantum level, this
phenomenon manifests its effects on the spectrum of the quantum Hamiltonian
while at the classical level there is no effect whatsoever on the spectrum of
the Liouville operator.
