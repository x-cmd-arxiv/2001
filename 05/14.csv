described by the log-normal PDF. On the other hand, we note that the one-to-one

profiles reveal that the hot gas seen with ISO is at the velocity of the
protostar, arguing against a location in the outflow or in shocks. Radiative
transfer calculations using a depth-dependent density and temperature structure
show that the data rule out a constant abundance throughout the envelope, but
that a model with a jump of the abundance in the inner part by two orders of
magnitude matches the observations. Such a jump is consistent with the sharp
increase in HCN abundance at temperatures >~230 K predicted by recent chemical
models in which atomic oxygen is driven into water at these temperatures.

suggests that we may be witnessing the birth of a hot core. Thus, GL 2591 may
represent a rare class of objects at an evolutionary stage just preceding the

developed to locate the ZAMS of these field stars in color-magnitude diagrams

to these ZAMS relations results in a distance modulus of 5.61+/-0.03 mag in
contrast to the Hipparcos modulus of 5.36+/-0.06 mag. Hence, we cannot confirm
the recent claim by Grenon (1999) that the distance problem is solved by
adopting a low metallicity of the Pleiades ([Fe/H]=-0.11) as determined from
Geneva photometry. The metallicity sensitivity of the ZAMS determined by the
field stars is investigated, and by combining this sensitivity in all three
color/temperature indices b-y, v-y, and beta we get a independent test of the
Pleiades distance modulus which support our value of 5.61 mag. Furthermore, the
field star sample used for the comparison is tested against theoretical
isochrones of different ages to show that evolutionary effects in the field
star sample are not biasing our distance modulus estimate significantly.

rich for their X-ray luminosities when compared to X-ray-selected clusters.
Apparently, X-ray and optical surveys do not necessarily sample identical mass

as well as low-lying excited states in AFM system with $m$-fold rotational
symmetry around the $\hat{z}$ axis. The energy level spectrum and the

significantly on the parity of the excess spins at sufficiently low
temperatures. Possible relevance to experiments is also discussed.

virtual radiative corrections which are related to the long-range Coulomb
forces. They may be sizeable for heavy nuclei since Z\alpha is not a small
parameter. So far these corrections are known only for two processes, elastic
scattering and bremsstrahlung on the Coulomb field of a point-like target.
While the former amplitude acquires only a phase, in the latter case the cross
section is modified also. Although the problem of Coulomb corrections for DIS
on nuclei is extremely difficult, it should be challenged rather than 'swept
under the carpet'. The importance of these radiative corrections is questioned
in present paper. We show that in the simplest case of a constant hadronic
current the Coulomb corrections provide a phase to the Born amplitude,
therefore the cross section remains the same. Inclusion of more realistic
hadronic dynamics changes this conclusion. The example of coherent production
of vector mesons off nuclei reveals large effects. So far a little progress has
been made deriving exact lepton wave functions in the Coulomb field of an
extended target. Employing available results based on the first-order
approximation in Z\alpha, we conclude that the Coulomb corrections are still
important for heavy nuclei. We also consider an alternative approach for
extended nuclear targets, the eikonal approximation, which we demonstrate to
reproduce the known exact results for Coulomb corrections. Calculating
electroproduction of vector mesons we again arrive at a large deviation from
the Born approximation. We conclude that one should accept with caution the
experimental results for nuclear effects in DIS based on analyses done in the

particle physics and cosmology. Current fashionable supersymmetric models
provide a natural dark matter candidate which is the lightest supersymmetric
particle (LSP). Such models combined with fairly well understood physics like
the quark substructure of the nucleon and the nuclear structure (form factor
and/or spin response function), permit the evaluation of the event rate for
LSP-nucleus elastic scattering. The thus obtained event rates are, however,
very low or even undetectable. So it is imperative to exploit the modulation
effect, i.e. the dependence of the event rate on the earth's annual motion.
Also it is useful to consider the directional rate, i.e its dependence on the
direction of the recoiling nucleus. In this paper we study such a modulation
effect both in non directional and directional experiments. We calculate both
the differential and the total rates using both isothermal, symmetric as well
as only axially asymmetric, and non isothermal, due to caustic rings, velocity
distributions. We find that in the symmetric case the modulation amplitude is
small. The same is true for the case of caustic rings. The inclusion of
asymmetry, with a realistic enhanced velocity dispersion in the galactocentric
direction, yields an enhanced modulation effect, especially in directional
experiments.

of conservative systems in mathematical physics. Recently, Y. Guo and the
author employed them to construct stable steady states for the Vlasov-Poisson
system in stellar dynamics, where the energy-Casimir functionals act on number
density functions on phase space. In the present paper we construct natural,
reduced functionals which act on mass densities on space and study compactness
properties and the existence of minimizers in this context. This puts the
techniques developed by Y.Guo and the author into a more general framework. We
recover the concentration-compactness principle due to P.L.Lions in a more
specific setting and connect our stability analysis with the one of G.Wolansky.

are stationary to a much better approximation than in previous simulations that

number. Energy spectra and shear-stress cospectra show that local isotropy is
satisfactorily obeyed at the level of second-order moments. However, derivative
moments of high-order up to n=7 yield increasing moments for n>=4 for the
spanwise vorticity and the transverse derivative of the streamwise velocity in
the range of Taylor Reynolds numbers 59<R_lambda<99. These findings, which are
in apparent violation of local isotropy, agree with recent measurements.

  in eps format)",,,,"nlin.CD",,"  The Harper (or ``almost Mathieu'') equation plays an important role in
studies of localization. Through a simple transformation, this equation can be
converted into an iterative two dimensional skew--product mapping of the
cylinder to itself. Localized states of the Harper system correspond to fractal
attractors with nonpositive maximal Lyapunov exponent in the dynamics of the
associated Harper map. We study this map and these strange nonchaotic
attractors (SNAs) in detail in this paper. The spectral gaps of the Harper
system have a unique labeling through a topological invariant of orbits of the
Harper map. This labeling associates an integer index with each gap, and the
scaling properties of the width of the gaps as a function of potential
strength, $\epsilon$ depends on the index. SNAs occur in a large region in
parameter space: these regions have a tongue--like shape and end on a Cantor
set on the line $\epsilon = 1$ where the states are critically localized, and
the spectrum is singular continuous. The SNAs of the Harper map are described
in terms of their fractal properties, and the scaling behaviour of their
power--spectra. These are created by unusual bifurcations and differ in many
respects from SNAs that have hitherto been studied. The technique of studying a
quantum eigenvalue problem in terms of the dynamics of an associated mapping
can be applied to a number of related problems in 1~dimension. We discuss
generalizations of the Harper potential as well as other quasiperiodic
potentials in this context.

basis yields a good separation of scales, as shown by an examination of the
contribution of different wavelet levels to the power spectrum. At most scales,
including the most energetic ones, we find essentially Gaussian dynamics. We
also show that removal of certain wavelet modes can be made without altering
the dynamics of the system as described by the Lyapunov spectrum.

two points in a plane by a smooth curve that goes through these points with a
given slope. The smoothness of any curve depends both on its curvature and its
length. The smoothest curves correspond to a particular compromise between
minimal curvature and minimal length. They can be described by a class of
functions that satisfy certain boundary conditions and minimize a weight
functional. The value of this functional is given essentially by the average of
the curvature raised to some power \nu times the length of the curve. The
parameter \nu determines the importance of minimal curvature with respect to
minimal length. In order to find the functions that obtain the minimal weight,
we use extensively notions that are well-known in classical mechanics. The
minimization of the weight functional via the Euler-Lagrange formalism leads to
a highly non-trivial differential equation. Using the symmetries of the problem
it is possible to find conserved quantities, that help to simplify the problem
to a level where the solution functions can be written in a closed form for any
given \nu. Applying the appropriate coordinate transformation to these
solutions allows to adjust them to all possible boundary conditions.
