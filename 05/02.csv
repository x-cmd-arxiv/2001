neutrino-driven protoneutron star winds, which immediately follow core-collapse

composition profiles and explore the systematics and structures generic to such
a wind for a variety of protoneutron star characteristics. Furthermore, we
derive the entropy, dynamical timescale, and neutron-to-seed ratio in the
general relativistic framework essential in assessing this site as a candidate
for $r$-process nucleosynthesis. Generally, we find that for a given mass
outflow rate ($\dot{M}$), the dynamical timescale of the wind is significantly
shorter than previously thought. We argue against the existence or viability of
a high entropy ($\gtrsim300$ per k$_{B}$ per baryon), long dynamical timescale
$r$-process epoch. In support of this conclusion, we model the protoneutron
star cooling phase, calculate nucleosynthetic yields in our steady-state
profiles, and estimate the integrated mass loss. We find that transonic winds
enter a high entropy phase only with very low $\dot{M}$
($\lesssim1\times10^{-9}$ M$_\odot$ s$^{-1}$) and extremely long dynamical
timescale ($\tau_\rho\gtrsim0.5$ seconds). Our results support the possible
existence of an early $r$-process epoch at modest entropy ($\sim150$) and very
short dynamical timescale, consistent in our calculations with a very massive
or very compact protoneutron star that contracts rapidly after the preceding
supernova. We explore possible modifications to our models, which might yield
significant $r$-process nucleosynthesis generically. Finally, we speculate on
the effect of fallback and shocks on both the wind physics and nucleosynthesis.

an X-ray emitting cluster of galaxies at a redshift of z=0.570 and a group at

redshift system, however, is a gravitational lens, with the lensed galaxy an
unusual AGN or star-forming system at z=3.356.

matter potential. The lower redshift group of galaxies at z=0.543 has, at most
1/5, more likely 1/10, of the X-ray luminosity of RX J0848+4456. Despite being

$CII\lambda$1036 interstellar absorption-line is essentially black in five of
the UV-brightest local starburst galaxies. Since the opacity of the neutral ISM
below the Lyman-edge will be significantly larger than in the $CII$ line, these
data provide strong constraints on the escape of ionizing radiation from these
starbursts. Interpreted as a a uniform absorbing slab, the implied optical
depth at the Lyman edge is huge ($\tau_0 \geq 10^2$). Alternatively, the areal
covering factor of opaque material is typically $\geq$ 94%. Thus, the fraction
of ionizing stellar photons that escape the ISM of each galaxy is small: our
conservative estimates typically yield $f_{esc} \leq 6%$. Inclusion of
extinction due to dust will further decrease $f_{esc}$. An analogous analysis
of the rest-UV spectrum of the star-forming galaxy $MS 1512-CB58$ at $z$ =2.7
leads to similar constraints on $f_{esc}$. These new results agree with the
constraints provided by direct observations below the Lyman edge in a few other
local starbursts. However, they differ from the recently reported properties of
star-forming galaxies at $z \geq$ 3. We assess the idea that the strong
galactic winds seen in many powerful starbursts clear channels through their
neutral ISM. We show empirically that such outflows may be a necessary - but
not sufficient - part of the process for creating a relatively porous ISM. We
note that observations will soon document the cosmic evolution in the
contribution of star-forming galaxies to the metagalactic ionizing background,
with important implications for the evolution of the IGM.

belonging to M31, the Andromeda galaxy. Our observations with HST/WFPC2 provide
data for the (I vs. V-I) and (V vs. V-I) color-magnitude diagrams. From model
fitting, we determine a rather high mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = --0.95 +-
0.09, somewhat similar to 47 Tucanae. We find a larger spread in V-I than can
be explained by the measurement errors, and we attribute this to an intrinsic
metallicity dispersion amongst the stars of G1. So far, only omega Centauri,
the giant Galactic globular cluster, has been known to exhibit such an
intrinsic metallicity dispersion.
  Three estimates of the total mass of this globular cluster can be obtained:
King mass = 15 x 10^6 with M/Lv ~ 7.5, Virial mass = 7.3 x 10^6 with M/Lv ~
3.6, and King-Michie mass range from 14 to 17 x 10^6. Although uncertain, all
of these mass estimates make G1 more than twice as massive as omega Centauri.
  Such large masses relate to the metallicity spread whose origin is still
unknown (either self-enrichment, an inhomogeneous proto-cluster cloud, or
remaining core of a dwarf galaxy). When considering the positions of G1 in the
different diagrams defined by Kormendy (1985), G1 always appears on the
sequence defined by globular clusters, and definitely away from the other
sequences defined by elliptical galaxies, bulges, and dwarf spheroidal
galaxies. The same is true for omega Centauri and for the nucleus of the dwarf
elliptical NGC 205. This does not prove that all (massive) globular clusters
are the remnant cores of nucleated dwarf galaxies.

Center. Each source has a main component with a brightness temperature in
excess of 10^{7.5} K, confirming that the sources are active galactic nuclei.
The sources have simple structure that can be characterized by one or two
Gaussian components. The frequency dependence of the structure indicates that
the positions of Sgr A* determined by the VLA astrometry of Backer & Sramek
(1999) at 4.8 and 8.4 GHz should have an offset of \sim 2 mas. This offset is
in the same direction as the 5 mas shift measured by Backer & Sramek (1999).
The structure is unlikely to bias the 43 GHz VLBA results of Reid et al (1999).
Motions of components in the calibrator sources could lead to errors in the

  All three sources show frequency dependent structure consistent with
scattering which is significantly stronger than that of the Galactic scattering
model of Taylor & Cordes (1993) but significantly weaker than that of the

D'Antona & Mazzitelli (1997), Baraffe et al. (1998), and Palla & Stahler (1999)
are tested against these dynamical mass measurements. Due to the intrinsic
color/T_eff variation within the K5 spectral class, each pre-main-sequence
model provides a mass range for the primary. The theoretical mass range derived
from the Baraffe et al. (1998) tracks that use a mixing length parameter
alpha=1.0 is closest to our measured primary mass, deviating between 1.3 and
1.6 sigma. The set of Baraffe et al. (1998) tracks that use alpha=1.9 deviate
between 1.6 and 2.1 sigma from our measured primary mass. The mass range given
by the Palla & Stahler (1999) tracks for the primary star deviate between 1.6

deviates by at least 3.0 sigma from our derived primary mass, strongly
suggesting that these tracks are inconsistent with our observation.
Observations of the secondary are less constraining than those of the primary,
but the deviations between the dynamical mass of the secondary and the mass
inferred for the secondary from the various pre-main-sequence tracks mirror the
deviations of the primary star. All of the pre-main-sequence tracks are
consistent with coevality of the components of NTT 045251+3016.

complicated histories of star formation ranging from a single very old episode
to a series of bursts over most of the Hubble time. We start from virialized
haloes of dark matter, and follow the infall of gas into the potential wells
and the formation of stars. We find that in objects of the same total mass,
different star formation histories are possible, if the collapse phase started
at different initial densities. We predict the final structure of dwarf
spheroidal galaxies, their kinematics, their large scale distribution of gas

enrichment. Using a population synthesis technique, star formation and metal

relatively flat mass distribution near the center, a magnetically supercritical

Jeans limit. It is expected to break up, through both gravitational and
possibly magnetic interchange instabilities, into a number of supercritical
dense cores, whose dynamic collapse may give rise to a burst of star formation.
Non-axisymmetric calculations are needed to follow in detail the expected ring
fragmentation into multiple cores and the subsequent core evolution.

unusual dispersion curve. The energy is an approximately quadratic function of
(p-p_0), the difference between the magnitude of the momentum p and a

velocity parallel to its momentum, when p<p_0 the velocity and momentum are
antiparallel. When p=p_0, the roton has non-zero momentum but zero velocity.
These kinematic properties lead to unusual trajectories when rotons scatter or
experience external forces. This paper examines this behavior in the classical
(ray optics) limit, where the roton wavelength is small compared with all other
dimensions. Several experiments illustrate these effects. The examples are
interesting in themselves, and also offer unconventional pedagogical

An adaptive scheme is used to optimize load balancing. We then demonstrate how
computing speeds of our parallel micro-simulations can be systematically
predicted once the scenario and the computer architecture are known. This makes
it possible, for example, to decide if a certain study is feasible with a
certain computing budget, and how to invest that budget. The main ingredients
of the prediction are knowledge about the parallel implementation of the
micro-simulation, knowledge about the characteristics of the partitioning of
the transportation network graph, and knowledge about the interaction of these

question of observational detection of possible non-trivial topologies in
universes with $\Omega_0 \sim 1$, which include a cosmological constant. Using
a number of indicators we find that as $\Omega_0 \to 1$, increasing families of
possible manifolds (topologies) become either undetectable or can be excluded
observationally. Furthermore, given a non-zero lower bound on $|\Omega_0 - 1|$,
we can rule out families of topologies (manifolds) as possible candidates for
the shape of our universe. We demonstrate these findings concretely by
considering families of topologies and employing bounds on cosmological
parameters from recent observations. We find that given the present bounds on
cosmological parameters, there are families of both hyperbolic and spherical
manifolds that remain undetectable and families that can be excluded as the
shape of our universe. These results are of importance in future search
strategies for the detection of the shape of our universe, given that there are
an infinite number of theoretically possible topologies and that the future
observations are expected to put a non-zero lower bound on $|\Omega_0 - 1|$

intervene between these two phases which are guaranteed to be present. The
simplest possibility, however, is a single first order phase transition between
CFL and nuclear matter. Such a transition, in space, could take place either
through a mixed phase region or at a single sharp interface with electron-free
CFL and electron-rich nuclear matter in stable contact. Here we construct a
model for such an interface. It is characterized by a region of separated
charge, similar to an inversion layer at a metal-insulator boundary. On the CFL
side, the charged boundary layer is dominated by a condensate of negative

hard core potential model D with slightly attractive $YY$ interactions. The
second potential set is based on the recent SU(3) extension of the Nijmegen
soft-core potential NSC97 with strongly attractive $YY$ interactions which may
allow for deeply bound hypernuclear matter. The results show that, for the
first potential set, the $\Sigma$ hyperon does not appear at all in the bulk at
any baryon density and for all strangeness fractions. The binding energy curves
of the resulting $N\Lambda\Xi$ system vary smoothly with density and the system
is stable (or metastable if we include the weak force). However, the situation
is drastically changed when using the second set where the $\Sigma$ hyperons
appear in the system at large baryon densities above a critical strangeness
fraction. We find strange hadronic matter undergoes a first order phase
transition from a $N\Lambda\Xi$ system to a $N\Sigma\Xi$ for strangeness
fractions $f_S>1.2$ and baryonic densities exceeding twice ordinary nuclear
matter density. Furthermore, it is found that the system built of $N\Sigma\Xi$
is deeply bound. This phase transition affects significantly the equation of
state which becomes much softer and a substantial drop in energy density and
