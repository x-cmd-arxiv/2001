emission line near 6.4 keV, with an equivalent width of 50 eV. The energy and
strength of this line is consistent with fluorescence from `neutral' iron in
the molecular torus, and we note the emerging ubiquity of this feature in
XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of Seyfert 1 galaxies over a wide

`soft excess', evident as an upward curvature in the continuum flux below 1.5

The RGS spectrum shows only weak discrete emission and absorption features in
the soft X-ray spectrum, supporting our conclusion that the soft excess
emission in Mkn 509 represents the high energy portion of optically thick,

resolution N-body simulations. This so-called cold dark matter (CDM) crisis has
been addressed in several ways, ranging from a change in fundamental physics by
introducing self-interacting cold dark matter particles to a tuning of complex
astrophysical processes such as global and/or local feedback. All these efforts
attempt to soften density profiles and reduce the abundance of satellites in
simulated galaxy halos. In this paper, we explore a somewhat different approach
which consists of filtering the dark matter power spectrum on small scales,
thereby altering the formation history of low mass objects. The physical
motivation for damping these fluctuations lies in the possibility that the dark
matter particles have a different nature i.e. are warm (WDM) rather than cold.
We show that this leads to some interesting new results in terms of the merger
history and large-scale distribution of low mass halos, as compared to the
standard CDM scenario. However, WDM does not appear to be the ultimate
solution, in the sense that it is not able to fully solve the CDM crisis, even
though one of the main drawbacks, namely the abundance of satellites, can be
remedied. Indeed, the cuspiness of the halo profiles still persists, at all
redshifts, and for all halos and sub-halos that we investigated. Despite the
persistence of the cuspiness problem of DM halos, WDM seems to be still worth
taking seriously, as it alleviates the problems of overabundant sub-structures
in galactic halos and possibly the lack of angular momentum of simulated disk
galaxies. WDM also lessens the need to invoke strong feedback to solve these
problems, and may provide a natural explanation of the clustering properties
and ages of dwarfs.

growing magnetic fluctuations is excited at subviscous scales. We study the
statistical correlations that are set up in the field pattern and show that the
magnetic-field lines possess a folding structure, where most of the scale
decrease is due to rapid transverse field direction reversals, while the scale
of the field variation along itself stays approximately constant. Specifically,
we find that the field strength and the field-line curvature are
anticorrelated, and the curvature possesses a stationary limiting distribution
with the bulk located at the values of curvature comparable to the
characteristic wave number of the velocity field and a power tail extending to
large values of curvature. The regions of large curvature, therefore, occupy
only a small fraction of the total volume of the system. Our theoretical
results are corroborated by direct numerical simulations. The implication of
the folding effect is that the advent of the Lorentz back reaction occurs when
the magnetic energy approaches that of the smallest turbulent eddies. Our
results also directly apply to the problem of statistical geometry of the

association with relatively nearby, large, active galaxies. The pattern is that
of clusters paired equidistant across a central galaxy with the apparent

The clusters and the galaxies in them tend to be strong X-ray and radio
emitters and their redshifts occur at preferred redshift values. The central,
low redshift galaxies often show evidence of ejection in the direction of these
higher redshift clusters and the clusters often show elongation along these
lines. In most of these respects the clusters resemble quasars which have been
increasingly shown for the last 34 years to be similarly associated with active

previously claimed. Radial velocity measurements covering suitable time spans
in order to detect a spectroscopic binary with the claimed period of about 7
days have been performed. The scatter of the radial velocity does not exceed
2.4 km/s, defining an upper mass limit of 24 Jupiter masses for any eclipsing
companion orbiting this star with the claimed period. Photometric observations
of RXJ1608.6-3922 in 7 consecutive nights (i.e. as long as the claimed orbital
period) reveal brightness variations of the order of 0.2 mag with a period of
3.6 days. The shape of the detected light curve differs from a light curve of
the star recorded in 1996. The small variations of the radial velocity, the
variable shape of the light curve, as well as (B-V) color variations suggest
that the flux of RXJ 1608.6-3922 is modulated by spots on the stellar surface
with a rotational period of 3.6 days. The stellar activity of this star seems
to be highly variable, taking into account the variable shape of the light
curve, with an amplitude varying from 0.5 to 0.2 mag in a few years, as well as
hints for a variable H$_{\alpha}$ equivalent width.

cosmic background radiation and hydrogen molecular production. We follow the
evolution of the structure since the recombination era until the present epoch.
As an application of this code we study the formation of voids starting from
negative density perturbations which evolved during and after the recombination
era. We analyse a set of COBE-normalized models, using different spectra to see
their influence on the formation of voids. Our results show that large voids
with diameters ranging from 10h^{-1} Mpc up to 50h^{-1} Mpc can be formed in a
universe model dominated by the cosmological constant (\Omega_\Lambda ~ 0.8).
This particular scenario is capable of forming large and deep empty regions
(with density contrasts \delta < -0.6). Our results also show that the physical
processes acting on the baryonic matter produce a transition region where the
radius of the dark matter component is greater than the baryonic void radius.
The thickness of this transition region ranges from about tens of kiloparsecs
up to a few megaparsecs, depending on the spectrum considered. Putative objects
formed near voids and within the transition region would have a different
amount of baryonic/dark matter when compared with \Omega_b/\Omega_d. If one
were to use these galaxies to determine, by dynamical effects or other
techniques, the quantity of dark matter present in the Universe, the result

structured shape, which depends on the position of the excitation spot. We
demonstrate that the power Fourier transform (PFT) of the emission spectrum
exhibits a certain peak-like structure, which also depends on the excitation
spot. Our intriguing observation is that averaging the individual PFTs does not
lead to a structureless curve, but rather yields a series of distinct transform
peaks. This suggests universality, namely that the underlying random resonators
that are responsible for the laser emission from the pi-conjugated polymer film
are almost identical. We argue that the reason for such an universality is the
large size of a typical resonator, which we determined from the PFT, as
compared to the emission wavelength, lambda. This fact is, in turn, a
consequence of the large light mean free path, l* approximately 10 lambda in
the polymer film. This contrasts previous observations of random lasing in
powders, where l* approx. lambda. We develop a simple theory that explains the
presence of peaks in the average PFT and predicts their shape. The results of

between PVs, and the nonlinear JV core size $\lambda_J$. It is shown that the
``shifted'' PV lattice (PVs displaced mainly along JVs in the crossing vortex
lattice structure), formed in high out-of-plane magnetic fields transforms into
the PV lattice ``trapped'' by the JV sublattice at a certain field, lower than
$\Phi_0/\gamma^2s^2$, where $\Phi_0$ is the flux quantum, $\gamma$ is the
anisotropy parameter and $s$ is the distance between CuO$_2$ planes.
  With further decreasing $B_z$, the free energy of the crossing vortex lattice
structure (PV and JV sublattices coexist separately) can exceed the free energy
of the tilted lattice (common PV-JV vortex structure) in the case of $\gamma

is realized in the intermediate field orientations, while the tilted vortex
lattice can exist if the magnetic field is aligned near the $c$-axis and the

$\gamma\Phi_0/\lambda_{ab}^2\lesssim B_x \lesssim \Phi_0/\gamma s^2$, the

contents of light-flavour isoscalars. This approach is based on
phenomenological laws of hadron production related to the spin, isospin,
strangeness content and mass of the particles. The ``effective'' numbers of s
and \bar{s} quarks in the isoscalar partners i_1 and i_2 are given by the
nonstrange-strange mixing angle \phi: k(i_1)=2\sin^2\phi and
k(i_2)=2\cos^2\phi. From the total production rates per hadronic Z decay of all
light-flavour hadrons measured so far at LEP the values for k are found to be:
k(\eta) \equiv 2-k(\eta^{\prime}) = 0.91 \pm 0.12, k(\phi) \equiv 2-k(\omega) =
1.94 \pm 0.09, k(f_2^{\prime}) \equiv 2-k(f_2) = 1.84 \pm 0.21 and k(f_0) =
0.09 \pm 0.13. Our results on the \eta--\eta^{\prime}, \omega--\phi and
f_2--f_2^{\prime} isoscalar mixing are consistent with the present experimental
evidence. Quite remarkably, our value for k(\eta) corresponds to the
singlet-octet mixing angle \theta_P = -12.4^{\circ} \pm 3.5^{\circ}. The
obtained strangeness content of the f_0(980) scalar/isoscalar is not consistent
with the values supported by different model studies. However, taking the
f_0(980) in our analysis with the mass of the bare state (K-matrix pole)
f_0^{bare}(720 \pm 100), the mixing angle is found to be: |\phi_S^{bare}| =
73^{\circ} \pm 7^{\circ} \pm 24^{\circ}, in good agreement with the prediction

Q-matrices of the integrable lattice systems associated with the quantum

presented to obtain an integral representation of generalized form factors. The
general techniques are applied to the quantum sine-Gordon model alias the
massive Thirring model. Exact expressions of all matrix elements are obtained
for several local operators. In particular soliton form factors of charge-less
operators as for example all higher currents are investigated. It turns out
that the various local operators correspond to specific scalar functions called
p-functions. The identification of the local operators is performed. In
particular the exact results are checked with Feynman graph expansion and full
agreement is found. Furthermore all eigenvalues of the infinitely many
conserved charges are calculated and the results agree with what is expected
from the classical case. Within the frame work of integrable quantum field
theories a general model independent `crossing' formula is derived. Furthermore
the `bound state intertwiners' are introduced and the bound state form factors
are investigated. The general results are again applied to the sine-Gordon
model. The integrations are performed and in particular for the lowest
breathers a simple formula for generalized form factors is obtained.

To make this procedure more efficient, we prove two new theorems that identify

terms of the facial structure of the original set.
  Let $K$ be a convex set in a real linear space $X$ and let $H$ be a subspace

The existence of such a bound for curves in P^3 was announced by Halphen in

bound is stated and proved by Chiantini, Ciliberto and Di Gennaro in 1993. The
bound is sharp, at least for d sufficiently large (Chiantini-Ciliberto- Di
Gennaro give examples of extremal curves for d large, that are in general
singular). The classification and the existence of curves of genus G(d, r, s)
is known for r=3 and d>s^2-s (Gruson and Peskine), and for r=4 and d> 12s^2

test particle in high-Reynolds number Lagrangian turbulence is correctly
described by Tsallis statistics with entropic index q=3/2. We present
theoretical arguments why Tsallis statistics can naturally arise in Lagrangian
turbulence and why at the smallest scales q=3/2 is relevant. A generalized
Heisenberg-Yaglom formula is derived from the nonextensive model.

  superconducting loop","4 pages, 4 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  In order to verify a possibility of a dc voltage predicted on segments of an
inhomogeneous superconducting loop the Little-Parks oscillations are
investigated on symmetrical and asymmetric Al loops. The amplitude of the
voltage oscillations $\Delta V$ measured on segments of symmetrical loop
increases with the measuring current $I_{m}$ and $\Delta V = 0$ at $I_{m}= 0$
in accordance with the classical Little-Parks experiment. Whereas the $\Delta
V$ measured on segments of asymmetric loop has a maximum value at $I_{m}= 0$.
The observation of the dc voltage at $I_{m}= 0$ means that one of the loop
segments is a dc power source and others is a load. The dc power can be induced
by both thermal fluctuation and a external electric noise.

C$_6$H$_6$, was computed fully {\em ab initio} by means of W2h theory as 1306.6
kcal/mol, to be compared with the experimentally derived value 1305.7+/-0.7
kcal/mol. The computed result includes contributions from inner-shell
correlation (7.1 kcal/mol), scalar relativistic effects (-1.0 kcal/mol), atomic
spin-orbit splitting (-0.5 kcal/mol), and the anharmonic zero-point vibrational
energy (62.1 kcal/mol). The largest-scale calculations involved are
CCSD/cc-pV5Z and CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ; basis set extrapolations account for 6.3
kcal/mol of the final result. Performance of more approximate methods has been
analyzed. Our results suggest that, even for systems the size of benzene,
chemically accurate molecular atomization energies can be obtained from fully
first-principles calculations, without resorting to corrections or parameters
derived from experiment.

the attainment of the classical limit in terms of measurement-induced
state-localization. It is possible to study the transition by fixing the
environmentally induced disturbance at a sufficiently small value, and
examining the dynamics as the system is made more macroscopic. When the system
action is relatively small, the dynamics is quantum mechanical and when the
system action is sufficiently large there is a transition to classical
behavior. The dynamics of the rotor in the region of transition, characterized
by the late-time momentum diffusion coefficient, can be strikingly different
from both the purely quantum and classical results. Remarkably, the early time
diffusive behavior of the quantum system, even when different from its
classical counterpart, is stabilized by the continuous measurement process.
This shows that such measurements can succeed in extracting essentially quantum
effects. The transition regime studied in this paper is accessible in ongoing
experiments.

lattice from one with boundaries; any classical deterministic LGA algorithm
distinguishing these two spatial topologies would have expected running time on
