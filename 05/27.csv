binaries and most galatic nuclei, based on different measuremental approaches,
but black holes aren't finally identified for the lack of very firm
observational evidence up to now. Because the direct evidence for BHs should
come from determination of strong gravitational redshift, we hope an object can
fall into the region near the BH horizon where radiation can be detected.
Therefore the object must be compact stars as neutron stars(NSs), then the
intense astrophysical processes will release very high energy radiation which
is transient, fast-variant. These phenomena may point to gamma-ray bursts(GRBs)
observed. And recent observations of iron lines suggest that afterglows of GRBs
show the similar property in active galatic nuclei(AGNs), implying GRBs may
originate from intense events related to black holes. In this letter, a model
for GRBs and afterglows is proposed to obtain the range of gravitational
redshifts($z_g$) of GRBs with known cosmological redshifts. Hence, we provide a
new method that with a search for high-energy emission lines(X- or
$\gamma$-rays) in GRBs, one can determine the gravitational redshift. We expect
$z_g>0.5$ or even larger, so that we can rule out the possibility of other
compact objects such as NSs, suggesting that the central progenitors of GRBs
should be black holes.

formal expansion is exact-assuming that the model under the study is
perturbative-only if diagrams to all orders are included, it is shown that for
large-on-site-Coulomb-repulsion-U systems weak-coupling expansions to a few
orders may already converge. We show that the screened interaction for the
large-U system can be vanishingly small at a certain intermediate electron
filling; and it is found that our approximation for the imaginary part of the
one-particle self energy agrees well with the QMC results in the low energy
scales at this particular filling. But, the usefulness of the approximation is
hindered by the fact that it has the incorrect filling dependence when the
filling deviates from this value. We also calculate the exact QMC Fermi
surfaces for the two-dimensional (2-D) Hubbard model for several fillings. Our
results near half filling show extreme violation of the concepts of the band
theory; in fact, instead of growing, Fermi surface vanishes when doped toward
the half-filled Mott-Hubbard insulator. Sufficiently away from half filling,
noninteracting-like Fermi surfaces are recovered. These results combined with
the Luttinger theorem might show that diagrammatic expansions for the
nearly-half-filled Hubbard model are unlikely to be possible; however, the
nonperturbative part of the solution seems to be less important as the filling
gradually moves away from one half. Results for the 2-D one-band Hubbard model
for several hole dopings are presented. Implications of this study for the
