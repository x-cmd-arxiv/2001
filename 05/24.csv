identified with SAX J1808.4-3658 if we assume that the BeppoSAX positional

on the similarities (position and luminosity) of this source with the above

the same source. If this source is not the millisecond pulsar, then during all

hollow elongated magnetotail. Reconnection of the magnetic field is observed in
the tail which may lead to acceleration of particles. Similar powers are
estimated to be released in the bow shock wave and in the magnetotail. The
estimated powers are, however, below present detection limits. Results of our

argument explains why rapid convective overturns persist within a newly formed
neutron star for roughly 10 seconds ($> 10^3$ overturns), consistent with
recent numerical models. A dynamical balance between turbulent and magnetic
stresses within this convective layer corresponds to flux densities in excess

becomes strongly convective. We compare the expected magnetic stresses in this
convective `gain layer' with those deep inside the neutron core.
  Buoyant motions of magnetized fluid are greatly aided by the intense neutrino
flux. We calculate the transport rate through a medium containing free neutrons
protons, and electrons, in the limiting cases of degenerate or non-degenerate
nucleons. Fields stronger than $\sim 10^{13}$ G are able to rise through the
outer degenerate layers of the neutron core during the last stages of

candidate with superluminal jet, GRO J1655-40, acquired during its 1996--1997

optically thick disk spectrum and a power-law. When the estimated 1--100 keV
power-law luminosity exceeds 1E37 erg/s (assuming a distance of 3.2 kpc), the
inner disk radius and the maximum color temperature derived from a simple
accretion disk model (a multi-color disk model) vary significantly with time.
These results reconfirm the previous report by Sobczak et al. (1999). In this
strong power-law state (once called ``very high state''), the disk luminosity
decreases with temperature, in contradiction to the prediction of the standard
Shakura-Sunyaev model. In the same state, the intensity of the power-law
component correlates negatively with that of the disk component, and positively
with the power-law photon index, suggesting that the strong power-law is simply
the missing optically thick disk emission. One possible explanation for this
behavior is inverse-Compton scattering in the disk. By re-fitting the same data
incorporating a disk Comptonization, the inner radius and temperature of the
underlying disk are found to become more constant. These results provide one of
the first observational confirmations of the scenario of disk Comptonization in
the strong power-law state. This strong power-law state seems to appear when
color temperature of the disk exceeds the certain threshold, 1.2 -- 1.3 keV.

compared to a newly compiled sample of normal galaxies. We present results of a

sample of 11 accretors (10 counterrotators and 1 polar ring). The SEST sample
is enlarged with published data from 48 galaxies, for which observational
evidence of counterrotation in the gas and/or the stars has been found.
Furthermore, the available data on a sample of 46 polar ring galaxies has been
compiled. It was found that the normalized content of cold gas (M_gas/L_B) in
polar rings is ~1 order of magnitude higher than the reference value derived
for normal galaxies. The inferred gas masses are sufficient to stabilize polar
rings through self-gravity. In contrast, it was found that the cold gas content
of counterrotators is close to normal for all galaxy types. Although
counterrotators and polar rings probably share a common origin, the gas masses
estimated here confirm that light gas rings accreted by future counterrotators
may have evolved faster than the self-gravitating structures of polar rings. In
this scenario, the transformation of atomic into molecular gas could be
enhanced near the transition region between the prograde and the retrograde
disks, especially in late-type accretors characterized by a high content of
primordial gas. This is tentatively confirmed in this work: the measured H_2/HI

sound in an electron liquid, while near the stellar surface they behave as
electromagnetic waves in a medium. The magnetosonic waves propagate across the
crust and transform into electromagnetic radiation at the surface. The vortex
contribution has the spectral index -0.45 and can explain nonthermal radiation

Detection of vortex radiation allows direct determination of the core
temperature. Comparing the theory with available spectra observations we find
that the core temperature of the Vela pulsar is T=8*10^8K, while the core
temperature of PSR B0656+14 exceeds 2*10^8K. This is the first measurement of

alternatively, the existence of a metal-insulator transition in the presence of
strong electron-electron interactions in two dimensions. We argue that under
the extreme conditions of ultra clean systems not only is the electron-electron
interaction very strong but the role of other system specific properties are
also enhanced. In particular, we emphasize the role of valleys in determining
the transport properties of the dilute electron gas in silicon inversion layers
(Si-MOSFETs). It is shown that for a high quality sample the temperature
behavior of the resistivity in the region close to the critical region of the
metal-insulator transition is well described by a renormalization group
analysis of the interplay of interaction and disorder if the electron band is
assumed to have two distinct valleys. The decrease in the resistivity up to
five times has been captured in the correct temperature interval by this
analysis, without involving any adjustable parameters. The considerable
variance in the data obtained from different Si-MOSFET samples is attributed to
the sample dependent scattering rate across the two valleys, presenting thereby
with a possible explanation for the absence of universal behavior in Si-MOSFET
samples of different quality.

equally spaced singularities in the density of states. Based on the
Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule a semiclassical theory is proposed to
understand these singularities. For disk geometries two kinds of states can be
distinguished: states either contribute through whispering gallery modes or are
Andreev states strongly coupled to the superconductor. Controlled by two
relevant material parameters, three kinds of energy spectra exist in disk
geometry. The first is dominated by Andreev reflections, the second, by normal
reflections in an annular disk geometry. In the third case the coherence length
is much larger than the radius of the superconducting region, and the spectrum
is identical to that of a full disk geometry.

transparently during movement. Mobile IP is the proposed standard by IETF.
Several studies, however, have shown that Mobile IP has several drawbacks, such
as triangle routing and poor handoff performance. Multicast-based mobility has
been proposed as a promising solution to the above problems, incurring less
end-to-end delays and fast smooth handoff. Nonetheless, such architecture
suffers from multicast state scalability problems with the growth in number of
mobile nodes. This architecture also requires ubiquitous multicast deployment
and more complex security measures. To alleviate these problems, we propose an
intra-domain multicast-based mobility solution. A mobility proxy allocates a
multicast address for each mobile that moves to its domain. The mobile uses
this multicast address within a domain for micro mobility. Also, aggregation is
considered to reduce the multicast state. We conduct multicast state analysis
to study the efficiency of several aggregation techniques. We use extensive
simulation to evaluate our protocol's performance over a variety of real and
generated topologies. We take aggregation gain as metric for our evaluation.
  Our simulation results show that in general leaky aggregation obtains better
gains than perfect aggregation. Also, we notice that aggregation gain increases
with the increase in number of visiting mobile nodes and with the decrease in
number of mobility proxies within a domain.

We present new anti-self-dual exact solutions of the Einstein field equations
with Euclidean and neutral (ultra-hyperbolic) signatures that admit only one
rotational Killing vector. Such solutions of the Einstein field equations are
determined by non-invariant solutions of Boyer-Finley ($BF$) equation. For the
case of Euclidean signature such a solution of the $BF$ equation was first
constructed by Calderbank and Tod. Two years later, Martina, Sheftel and
Winternitz applied the method of group foliation to the Boyer-Finley equation
and reproduced the Calderbank-Tod solution together with new solutions for the
neutral signature. In the case of Euclidean signature we obtain new metrics
which asymptotically locally look like a flat space and have a non-removable
singular point at the origin. In the case of ultra-hyperbolic signature there
exist three inequivalent forms of metric. Only one of these can be obtained by
analytic continuation from the Calderbank-Tod solution whereas the other two
are new.

automatically imply charge universality on the brane. We study whether this
condition is satisfied in the two known proposals aimed to localize vector
field in flat bulk space. We construct a simple calculable model with
confinement in the bulk and deconfinement on the brane, as in the
Shifman--Dvali set up. We find that in our model the 4-dimensional Coulomb law
is indeed reproduced on the brane due to the massless localized photon mode.
The charge universality is enforced by the presence of ``confining strings''.
On the other hand, charge universality condition is not satisfied in another,
brane-induced localization mechanism when the number of extra dimensions d is
larger than two. We demonstrate that in the non-Abelian case the gauge fields
inside the brane are never four-dimensional and their self-interaction is
strong at all distances of interest. Hence this mechanism does not work for
d>2. At d=2 the charge universality is still a problem, but it holds
automatically at d=1. At d=1, however, the bulk gauge fields are strongly
coupled in the non-Abelian case.

be scaled up, and transformed into a ""hadronic constant"" and into ""strong
masses"", respectively. Due to the unusual range of Lambda and M values
considered, we met a series of solutions of the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter

those solutions be stable, i.e., that their temperature (or surface gravity) be
vanishingly small, implies the coincidence of at least two of their (in
general, three) horizons. Imposing the stability condition of a certain horizon
does yield (once chosen the values of J, q and Lambda) mass and radius of the
associated black-hole (hereafter BH). In the case of ordinary Einstein
equations and for stable BHs of the KNdS type, we get in particular Regge-like
(hereafter RL) relations among mass M, angular momentum J, charge q and
cosmological constant Lambda; which did not receive enough attention in the

If a subdivision is convex, then according to the Viro theorem a combinatorial
hypersurface is isotopic to an algebraic one. We study combinatorial
hypersurfaces resulting from non-convex subdivisions of convex polytopes, show
that they are almost complex varieties, and in the real case, they satisfy the

fact, occurs in a number of important applied problems. In that case the
deterministic exponent is negligible, so the n^{-1/2} Monte Carlo and the
n^{-1} quantum speedup essentially constitute the entire convergence rate. We
observe that -- there is an exponential speed-up of quantum algorithms over
deterministic (classical) algorithms, if k/d tends to zero; -- there is a
(roughly) quadratic speed-up of quantum algorithms over randomized classical
algorithms, if k/d is small.

most general attack, by using the techniques of *two*-way entanglement
purification. We demonstrate clearly the advantage of classical post-processing
with two-way classical communications over classical post-processing with only
one-way classical communications in QKD. This is done by the explicit
construction of a new protocol for (the error correction/detection and privacy
amplification of) BB84 that can tolerate a bit error rate of up to 18.9%, which
is higher than what any BB84 scheme with only one-way classical communications
can possibly tolerate. Moreover, we demonstrate the advantage of the six-state
scheme over BB84 by showing that the six-state scheme can strictly tolerate a
higher bit error rate than BB84. In particular, our six-state protocol can
tolerate a bit error rate of 26.4%, which is higher than the upper bound of 25%
bit error rate for any secure BB84 protocol. Consequently, our protocols may
allow higher key generation rate and remain secure over longer distances than
previous protocols. Our investigation suggests that two-way entanglement
purification is a useful tool in the study of advantage distillation, error
correction, and privacy amplification protocols.
