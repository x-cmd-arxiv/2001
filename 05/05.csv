extrasolar planetary systems is omega, the argument of pericenter of a given
planet's orbit referenced to the plane of the sky. Curiously, the omega's of
the outer two planets orbiting Upsilon Andromedae are presently nearly
identical: Delta-omega = omega_D - omega_C = 4.8 deg +/- 4.8 deg (1 sigma).
This observation is least surprising if planets C and D occupy orbits that are
seen close to edge-on (sin i_C, sin i_D > 0.5) and whose mutual inclination
Theta does not exceed 20 deg. In this case, planets C and D inhabit a secular
resonance in which Delta-omega librates about 0 deg with an amplitude of 30 deg
and a period of 4000 yr. The resonant configuration spends about one-third of
its time with |Delta-omega| < 10 deg. If Theta > 40 deg, either Delta-omega
circulates or the system is unstable. This instability is driven by the Kozai
mechanism which couples the eccentricity of planet C to Theta to drive the
former quantity to values approaching unity. Our expectation that Theta < 20
deg suggests that planets C and D formed in a flattened, circumstellar disk,
and may be tested by upcoming astrometric measurements with the FAME satellite.

transfer equation (RTE), sophisticated techniques are required. Various
techniques have been employed for the attenuation in disc galaxies, but a
quantitative comparison of them is difficult, because of the differing
assumptions, approximations and accuracy requirements which are adopted in the
literature. In this paper, we present an unbiased comparison of four methods to
solve the RTE, in terms of accuracy, efficiency and flexibility. We apply them
all on one problem that can serve as a first approximation of large portions of
disc galaxies: a one-dimensional plane-parallel geometry, with both absorption
and multiple scattering taken into account, with an arbitrary vertical
distributions of stars and dust and an arbitrary angular redistribution of the
scattering. We find that the spherical harmonics method is by far the most
efficient way to solve the RTE, whereas both Monte Carlo simulations and the
iteration method, which are straightforward to extend to more complex
geometries, have a cost which is about 170 times larger.

an improper treatment of scattering dominate those due to an imprecise

the period of 350 to 1000 days after the burst. These radio data clearly
indicate that there is a persistent source at the position of GRB980703 with a
flux density of approximately 70 $\mu$Jy at 1.43 GHz, and a spectral index,
$\beta\approx 0.32$, where $F_\nu\propto \nu^{-\beta}$. We show that emission
from the afterglow of GRB980703 is expected to be one to two orders of
magnitude fainter, and therefore cannot account for these observations. We
interpret this persistent emission as coming from the host galaxy --- the first
example of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) host detection at radio wavelengths. We show
that emission from an AGN is unlikely, and find that it can be explained as a
result of a star-formation rate (SFR) of massive stars (M>5M$_\odot$) of 90
M$_\odot$/yr, which gives a total SFR of $\approx 500$ M$_\odot$/yr. Using the
correlation between the radio and far-IR (FIR) luminosities of star-forming
galaxies, we find that the host of GRB980703 is at the faint end of the class
of Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs), with L_{FIR}\sim few\times
10^{12} L$_\odot$. From the radio measurements of the offset between the burst
and the host, and the size of the host, we conclude that GRB980703 occurred
near the center of the galaxy in a region of maximum star formation. A
comparison of the properties of this galaxy with radio and optical surveys at a
similar redshift ($z\approx 1$) reveals that the host of GRB980703 is an
average star-forming galaxy. This result has significant implications for the
potential use of a GRB-selected galaxy sample for the study of galaxies and the

of dark matter haloes obtained by Bullock et al. from high resolution N-body
simulations of structure formation in a LCDM Universe. We find that although
the disk mass fractions are significantly smaller than the Universal baryon
fraction, the total specific angular momenta of the disks are in good agreement
with those of dark matter haloes. This suggests that disks form out of only a
small fraction of the available baryons, but yet manage to draw most of the
available angular momentum. In addition we find that the angular momentum
distributions of disks are clearly distinct from those of the dark matter;
disks lack predominantly both low and high specific angular momentum.
Understanding these findings in terms of a coherent picture for disk formation
is challenging. Cooling, feedback and stripping, which are the main mechanisms
to explain the small disk mass fractions found, seem unable to simultaneously
explain the disk's angular momentum distribution. In fact, it seems that the
baryons that make up the disks must have been born out of angular momentum
distributions that are clearly distinct from those of LCDM haloes. Therefore,
understanding the angular momentum content of disk galaxies remains an
important challenge for our picture of galaxy formation.

and elliptical galaxies, and are generally similar to those of local starburst
galaxies with modest amounts of reddening. We use stellar population synthesis
models to study the properties of the stars that dominate the light from LBGs.
Under the assumption that the star-formation rate is continuous or decreasing
with time, the best-fitting models provide a lower bound on the LBG mass
estimates. LBGs with ``L*'' UV luminosities are estimated to have minimum
stellar masses ~ 10^10 solar masses, or roughly 1/10th that of a present-day L*
galaxy. By considering the effects of a second component of maximally-old
stars, we set an upper bound on the stellar masses that is ~ 3-8 times the
minimum estimate. We find only loose constraints on the individual galaxy ages,
extinction, metallicities, initial mass functions, and prior star-formation
histories. We find no galaxies whose SEDs are consistent with young (< 10^8
yr), dust-free objects, which suggests that LBGs are not dominated by ``first
generation'' stars, and that such objects are rare at these redshifts. We also
find that the typical ages for the observed star-formation events are
significantly younger than the time interval covered by this redshift range (~
1.5 Gyr). From this, and from the relative absence of candidates for quiescent,
non-star-forming galaxies at these redshifts in the NICMOS data, we suggest
that star formation in LBGs may be recurrent, with short duty cycles and a
timescale between star-formation events of < 1 Gyr. [Abridged]

boundary are first incorporated (via a canonical transformation) into an
effective potential, rendering the one-particle motion in the 2D rippled
billiard equivalent to that of two-interacting particles in 1D geometry. We
show that classical counterparts of SES and LDOS in the case of strong chaotic
motion reveal quite a good correspondence with the quantum quantities. We also
show that the main features of the SES and LDOS can be explained in terms of
the underlying classical dynamics, in particular of certain periodic orbits. On
the other hand, statistical properties of eigenstates and LDOS turn out to be
different from those prescribed by random matrix theory. We discuss the quantum
effects responsible for the non-ergodic character of the eigenstates and
individual LDOS that seem to be generic for this type of billiards with a large

instantons using mirror symmetry to a large class of D-branes wrapped over

the notion of ``flat coordinates'' for the boundary theory. We also discover an
integer IR ambiguity needed to define the quantum theory of D-branes wrapped
over non-compact Lagrangian submanifolds. In the large $N$ dual Chern-Simons
theory, this ambiguity is mapped to the UV choice of the framing of the knot.
In a type IIB dual description involving $(p,q)$ 5-branes, disk instantons of
type IIA get mapped to $(p,q)$ string instantons. The M-theory lift of these
results lead to computation of superpotential terms generated by M2 brane
