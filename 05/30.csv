4686 emission comparable in strength to H beta. V2069 Cyg appears to be a
luminous novalike variable, and the strong HeII suggests it may be an
intermediate polar. The period of KUV 03580+0614 is similar to members of the
SW Sex-type novalike variables, and it shows the phase-dependent absorption in
the Balmer and He I lines typical of this subclass. AF Cam shows absorption
features from a K-type secondary, as expected given its rather long orbital
period. The secondary spectrum and the outburst magnitude both suggest that AF
Cam is about 1 kpc distant. The spectrum of PG 0935+075 resembles that of a
dwarf nova at minimum light, with a noticeable contribution from an M-dwarf
secondary star. The secondary spectrum and a tentative outburst magnitude both
suggest a distance near 500 pc.

redshift survey (2dFGRS). The 2dFGRS is over an order of magnitude larger than
previous redshift surveys used to address this issue. We measure the projected
two-point correlation function of galaxies in a series of volume-limited
samples. The projected correlation function is free from any distortion of the
clustering pattern induced by peculiar motions and is well described by a
power-law in pair separation over the range 0.1 < r /h Mpc < 10. The clustering
of L* galaxies in real space is well fit by a correlation length r0 = 4.9 +/-
0.3 /h Mpc and power-law slope gamma = 1.71 +/- 0.06. The clustering amplitude
increases slowly with absolute magnitude for galaxies fainter than M*, but
rises more strongly at higher luminosities. At low luminosities, our results
agree with measurements from the SSRS2 by Benoist et al. However, we find a
weaker dependence of clustering strength on luminosity at the highest
luminosities. The correlation function amplitude increases by a factor of 4.0
between $M_{b_{J}} -5\log_{10}h = -18$ and -22.5, and the most luminous
galaxies are 3.0 times more strongly clustered than L* galaxies. The power-law
slope of the correlation function shows remarkably little variation for samples
spanning a factor of 20 in luminosity. Our measurements are in very good
agreement with the predictions of the hierarchical galaxy formation models of
Benson et al.

third dimension becomes a priori important as soon as matter clumping causes a

calculate the gravitational forces via a particle-mesh FFT-method, increasing
the performance with respect to previous direct force calculations. Persistent

characteristic depend on the dissipation rate are obtained and described. Some
of our simulations reveal first signs of mass-size and velocity dispersion-size
power-law relations, but a clear scale invariant behavior will require more

Compton scattering and the effects of continuum opacities of the most important
metal species (C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe, Ni). With these new effects
incorporated, we compute the predicted spectrum from black holes accreting at
nearly the Eddington luminosity (L/L_Edd = 0.3) and central masses of 10^6,
10^7, and 10^8 M_sun. We also consider two values of the Shakura-Sunyaev alpha
parameter, 0.1 and 0.01. Although it has little effect when M > 10^8 M_sun,
Comptonization grows in importance as the central mass decreases and the
central temperature rises. It generally produces an increase in temperature
with height in the uppermost layers of hot atmospheres. Compared to models with
coherent electron scattering, Comptonized models have enhanced EUV/soft X-ray
emission, but they also have a more sharply declining spectrum at very high
frequencies. Comptonization also smears the hydrogen and the He II Lyman edges.
The effects of metals on the overall spectral energy distribution are smaller
than the effects of Comptonization for these parameters. Compared to pure
hydrogen-helium models, models with metal continuum opacities have reduced flux
in the high frequency tail, except at the highest frequencies, where the flux
is very low. Metal photoionization edges are not present in the overall
disk-integrated model spectra. In addition to our new grid of models, we also

to distinguish three types of low-frequency QPOs (one more than those reported
by Wijnands, Homan, & van der Klis 1999). For the most common type, the phase
lag is correlated with both the QPO frequency and the amplitude. The physical
significance of the QPO types is evident in the relationships between QPO
properties and the apparent temperature and flux from the accretion disk. There
is also a clear pattern in how the QPO types relate to the presence of
high-frequency QPOs. In general, both the amplitude and the Q value
(freq./FWHM) of low-frequency QPOs decrease as the high-frequency oscillations
increase in frequency (100 to 284 Hz) and in Q value. We speculate that the
antagonism between low-frequency and high-frequency QPOs arises from competing
structures in a perturbed accretion disk. However, we find that the frequencies
of slow (< 20 Hz) and fast (> 100 Hz) QPOs are not correlated. In addition, we
encounter systematic problems in attempting to reliably compare the QPO
frequencies with broad features in the power continuum, since there are a
variable number of such features in the power spectra. These results cast some
doubt on the reported global relationship between QPOs from neutrons stars and
those from black hole systems.

respectively $2\times10^{-11}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $2\times10^{41}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. These are about 10 times higher than the extrapolation from the soft

the hard X-ray emission most likely arises from a low luminosity active

This suggests that hidden low luminosity AGNs may well be present in other

the line of sight over several years, suggesting that the Compton thick
absorption material may be present on a spatial scale of a parsec. Apart from

outer carbonaceous belt, about 0.5 AU wide and centered at R~3.2 AU. The colors
of Hungarias, Mars crossers, and near-Earth objects are more similar to the

the same time, the correlation integral method is compared and contrasted with

Tafalla et al., and this result confirms that infall speeds in starless cores
are generally faster than expected from ambipolar diffusion in a strongly
sub-critical core. In addition, the observed infall regions are too extended to
be consistent with the `inside-out' collapse model applied to a very low-mass
star. In the largest cores, the spatial extent of the CS spectra with infall
asymmetry is larger than the extent of the $\rm N_2H^+$ core by a factor of
2-3. All these results suggest that extended inward motions are a common
feature in starless cores, and that they could represent a necessary stage in
the condensation of a star-forming dense core.

which we derive the orbital parameters. We find a spectroscopic period of
P=2.56387 +/- (4 times 10^{-5}) days and a semiamplitude of K_2=132.9 +/- 4.0
km/s. The resulting mass function, which is a firm lower limit on the mass of
the white dwarf, is then f(M)=0.624 +/- 0.056 solar masses. The secondary star
is a ``stripped giant'', and using relations between the core mass and the
luminosity and the core mass and the radius we derive a lower limit of M_2 >
0.165 solar masses for the secondary star. The rotational velocity of the
secondary star is not resolved in our spectra and we place a limit of
V_rot*sin(i) < 40 km/s. The long-term light curve shows variations of up to 0.4
mag on short (1-5 days) time scales, and variations of 0.2-0.4 mag on longer
(3-9 months) time scales. In spite of these variations, the ellipsoidal light
curve of the secondary star is easily seen when the data are folded on the
spectroscopic ephemeris. Ellipsoidal models fit to the mean light curve give an
inclination in the range 66.96 < i < 78.08 degrees (90 per cent confidence).
This inclination range, and the requirement that M_2 > 0.165 solar masses and
V_rot*sin(i) < 40 km/s yields a white dwarf mass of M_1=0.977^{+0.168}_{-0.098}
solar masses and a secondary star mass of M_2=0.172^{+0.029}_{-0.012} solar
masses (90 per cent confidence limits). Our findings confirm the suggestion of

predicts an absorption distribution consistent with that found from the

enough, there is evidence of a decoupling between X-ray absorption and optical

equation of state of the interstellar gas, the molecular cloud cores experience
several different phases as collapse proce eds. In the isothermal run-away
collapse ($n \lesssim 10^{10}{\rm H_2 cm}^{-3}$), a pseudo-disk is formed and
it continues to contract till the opaque core is fo rmed at the center. In this
disk, a number of MHD fast and slow shock pairs appear running parallelly to
the disk. After the equation of state becomes hard, an adiabatic core is
formed, which is separated from the isothermal contracting pseudo-disk by the
accretion shock front facing radially outwards. By the effect of the magnetic
tension, the angular momentum is transferred from the disk mid-plane to the
surface. The gas with excess angular momentum near the surface is finally
ejected, which explains the molecular bipolar outflow. Two types of outflows
are observed. When the poloidal magnetic field is strong (magnetic energy is
comparable to the thermal one), a U-shaped outflow is formed in which fast
moving gas is confined to the wall whose shape looks like a capit al letter U.
The other is the turbulent outflow in which magnetic field lines and velocity
fi elds are randomly oriented. In this case, turbulent gas moves out almost
perpendicularly from the disk. The continuous mass accretion leads to the
quasistatic contraction of the first core. A second collapse due to
dissociation of H$_2$ in the first core follows. Finally another quasistatic
core is again formed by atomic hydrogen (the second core). It is found that
another outflow is ejected around the second atomic core, which seems to
correspond to the optical jets or the fast neutral winds.

``Swiss cheese'' picture of a single CuO_2 layer, in which a substitutional Zn
impurity creates a normal region of area $\pi\xi_{ab}^2$ around it as
originally suggested by Nachumi et al. Here $\xi_{ab}$ is the zero-temperature
in-plane coherence length at x = 0. We use this picture to calculate the
variation of the in-plane superfluid density with x at temperature T = 0, using
both a numerical approach and an analytical approximation. For $\delta = 0.37$,
if we use the value $\xi_{ab}$ = 18.3 angstrom, we find that the in-plane
superfluid decreases with increasing x and vanishes near $x_c = 0.01$ in the
analytical approximation, and near $x_c = 0.014$ in the numerical approach.
$x_c$ is quite sensitive to $\xi_{ab}$, whose value is not widely agreed upon.
The model also predicts a peak in the real part of the conductivity,
Re$\sigma_e(\omega, x)$, at concentrations $x \sim x_c$, and low frequencies,
and a variation of critical current density with x of the form $J_c(x) \propto
n_{S,e}(x)^{7/4}$ near percolation, where $n_{S,e}(x)$ is the in-plane
superfluid density.

this solution from previous ones in the literature. The singularity structure
of the manifold is explored: some models in the class do not exhibit a big

initial singularity, the equation of state of the induced matter evolves from
radiation like at early epochs to Milne-like at late times and the big bang

5D null geodesics onto the 4D submanifold is shown to be compatible with

magnetic field $\vec B$ and noncommutative parameter $\te$. We prove that the
degeneracy of Landau levels can be lifted by the $\te$-term appearing in the

temperature limit, the system exibits a magnetic $\te$-dependent behaviour,
which is missing in the commutative case. Moreover, a correction to
susceptibility at low $T$ is observed. Using the {\it Fermi-Dirac} trace
formulas, a generalization of the thermodynamical potential, the average number
of electrons and the magnetization is obtained. There is a critical point where
the thermodynamical potential becomes infinite in both of two methods above. So
at this point we deal with the partition function by adopting another approach.
The standard results in the commutative case for this model can be recovered by
switching off the $\te$-parameter.

generalised Brinkhuis triples. The problem of finding such triples can
essentially be reduced to a combinatorial problem, which can efficiently be
treated by computer. In particular, it is shown that the number of square-free

  11 figures",,"10.1007/PL00013289",,"physics.flu-dyn",,"  The dynamic model for large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent flows requires
test filtering the resolved velocity fields in order to determine model
coefficients. However, test filtering is costly to perform in large-eddy
simulation of complex geometry flows, especially on unstructured grids. The
objective of this work is to develop and test an approximate but less costly
dynamic procedure which does not require test filtering. The proposed method is
based on Taylor series expansions of the resolved velocity fields. Accuracy is
governed by the derivative schemes used in the calculation and the number of
terms considered in the approximation to the test filtering operator. The
expansion is developed up to fourth order, and results are tested a priori
based on direct numerical simulation data of forced isotropic turbulence in the
context of the dynamic Smagorinsky model. The tests compare the dynamic
Smagorinsky coefficient obtained from filtering with those obtained from
application of the Taylor series expansion. They show that the expansion up to
second order provides a reasonable approximation to the true dynamic
coefficient (with errors on the order of about 5 % for c_s^2), but that
including higher-order terms does not necessarily lead to improvements in the
results due to inherent limitations in accurately evaluating high-order
derivatives. A posteriori tests using the Taylor series approximation in LES of
forced isotropic turbulence and channel flow confirm that the Taylor series
approximation yields accurate results for the dynamic coefficient. Moreover,
the simulations are stable and yield accurate resolved velocity statistics.

contractive channels render the states of the computer less distinguishable in
the sense of quantum detection theory. Starting from the premise that all
experimental procedures can be carried out with finite precision, we argue that
there exists a physically meaningful connection between strictly contractive
channels and errors in physically realizable quantum computers. We show that,
in the absence of error correction, sensitivity of quantum memories and
computers to strictly contractive errors grows exponentially with storage time
and computation time respectively, and depends only on the constant $k$ and the
measurement precision. We prove that strict contractivity rules out the
possibility of perfect error correction, and give an argument that approximate

computing are limited by low initial polarization. To address this problem, we
have investigated the use of optical pumping techniques to enhance the
polarization of a 2-qubit NMR quantum computer (13C and 1H in 13CHCl3). To
efficiently use the increased polarization, we have generalized the procedure
for effective pure state preparation. With this new, more flexible scheme, an
effective pure state was prepared with polarization-enhancement of a factor of
10 compared to the thermal state. An implementation of Grover's quantum search
algorithm was demonstrated using this new technique.

Oscillator (OPO) to reduce the quantum fluctuations of the reflected pump beam
below the shot noise limit. The OPO consisted of a triply resonant cavity
containing a Periodically-Poled Lithium Niobate crystal pumped by a Nd:YAG
laser and giving signal and idler wavelengths close to 2.12 microns and a
threshold as low as 300 microwatts. We detected the quantum fluctuations of the
pump beam reflected by the OPO using a slightly modified homodyne detection
technique. The measured noise reduction was 30 % (inferred noise reduction at
the output of the OPO 38 %).

J. D v.19 p.263 (2002)","10.1140/epjd/e20020077",,"quant-ph cond-mat nlin.CD",,"  A legend tells that once Loschmidt asked Boltzmann on what happens to his
statistical theory if one inverts the velocities of all particles, so that, due
to the reversibility of Newton's equations, they return from the equilibrium to
a nonequilibrium initial state. Boltzmann only replied ``then go and invert
them''. This problem of the relationship between the microscopic and
macroscopic descriptions of the physical world and time-reversibility has been
hotly debated from the XIXth century up to nowadays. At present, no modern
computer is able to perform Boltzmann's demand for a macroscopic number of
particles. In addition, dynamical chaos implies exponential growth of any
imprecision in the inversion that leads to practical irreversibility. Here we
show that a quantum computer composed of a few tens of qubits, and operating
even with moderate precision, can perform Boltzmann's demand for a macroscopic
number of classical particles. Thus, even in the regime of dynamical chaos, a
realistic quantum computer allows to rebuild a specific initial distribution
from a macroscopic state given by thermodynamic laws.

confined in a linear ion trap. Using several consecutive steps of averaging we
derive, from the full quantum mechanical master equation, an equation for the
total mechanical energy of the one dimensional crystal, defined on a
coarse-grained energy scale whose grid size is smaller than the linewidth of
the electronic transition. This equation describes the cooling dynamics for an
arbitrary number of ions and in the quantum regime. We discuss the validity of
the ergodic assumption (i.e. that the phase space distribution is only a
function of energy). From our equation we derive the semiclassical limit (i.e.
when the mechanical motion can be treated classically) and the Lamb-Dicke limit
(i.e. when the size of the mechanical wave function is much smaller than the
laser wavelength). We find a Fokker-Planck equation for the total mechanical
energy of the system, whose solution is in agreement with previous analytical
calculations which were based on different assumptions and valid only in their
specific regimes. Finally, in the classical limit we derive an analytic
expression for the average coupling, by light scattering, between motional
states at different energies.
