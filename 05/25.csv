Maser emission was observed over four epochs spaced by three weeks during late
1998. SVS13 is associated with the millimeter continuum SED Class I source
SSV13A1. High resolution CO observations have secured the association of the
flow with the continuum object on arc-second scales. A 1998 Aug 12 VLA
observation places the blueshifted masers within 80 AU (0''.2) of the 2.7 mm
position for A1 reported from BIMA. We report observations of two groups of
masers, one redshifted by about 6 km s-1 and one blueshifted by about 2-3 km
s-1, separated by about 100 AU in projected distance along position angle 21
degrees. Redshifted masers were present only in the latter two epochs. During
all epochs, an arclike structure was present with similar morphology; over time
this structure moved relative to the southernmost blue maser toward the
southeast, roughly along the position angle defined by the Herbig-Haro objects,
with a proper motion of about 13 km s-1. Both redshifted and blueshifted masers
are clearly part of the same lobe of the flow; their observed Doppler shifts
are artifacts of the opening angle of the flow. Our data suggest that the
opening angle is about 10 degrees. We measure lower expansion velocities and a
wider opening angle than has been found in some other flows near Class 0 SED
objects, perhaps indicating that the flows open and slow as they age.

cloud sedimentation predict redder i'-z' colors--by up to 2 magnitudes--than
models that neglect sedimentation. We explore the previously known J-K color
trends where objects first become redder, then bluer with decreasing effective
temperature. Only models that include sedimentation of condensates are able to
reproduce these trends. We find that the exact track of a cooling brown in J-K

efficiency of sedimentation of condensates in its atmosphere. We also find that
clouds still affect the strength of the J, H, and K band fluxes of even the

behavior of the only known accretion-driven millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX
J1808.4-3658 during its 2000 outburst, as observed with RXTE. The maximum
observed luminosity is ~2.5 x 10^35 erg s^-1 (3-25 keV; for a distance of 2.5
kpc), which is a factor of ~10 lower than that observed during the 1996 and
1998 outbursts. Due to solar constraints, the source could not be observed for
several months with RXTE before 21 Jan. 2000. Therefore, the exact moment of
the outburst onset is unknown and the peak luminosity could have been
significantly higher. On some occasions SAX J1808.4-3658 was observed with
luminosities of ~10^35 erg s^-1, but on other occasions it could not be
detected with RXTE resulting in upper limits of a few times 10^33 erg s^-1
(3-25 keV). The non-detections of the source during its 2000 outburst obtained
with BeppoSAX demonstrate that its luminosity was at times <10^32 erg s^-1
(0.5-10 keV). However, only a few days after these BeppoSAX observations, we
detected the source again with RXTE at high luminosities, giving a factor of
>1000 of luminosity swings in this system on time scales of days. The last
detection of SAX J1808.4-3658 with RXTE was on 2000 May 13, almost 4 months
after the first detection. Due to the lack of sensitivity and observations
during the 1996 and 1998 outbursts, it cannot be excluded that after those
outbursts the source remained active for months and that the source behavior
during the 2000 outburst is not unique. Long duration activity at low
luminosities has been observed in other transients (both neutron stars and
black holes), although not with such extreme variability which might point to a
different origin for this behavior for the pulsar.

absorption to extrinsic free-free absorption by a intervening cloud of thermal

turnover in the integrated continuum spectrum and from the detection of radio
recombination lines toward the remnant. Our observations confirm the basic
conclusions of those measurements, and our observations have resolved the
absorber into a complex of classical HII regions surrounded either partially or
fully by low-density HII gas. We identify this low-density gas as an extended

using the information annotated in the genomes we discover that in most of the

preferentially locate near the 3' end of the nearest coding regions. We also
show that IRs characterized by large values of the stem length locate
preferentially in short non-coding regions bounded by two 3' ends of convergent

deposition and desorption primary processes) is investigated theoretically and
probed experimentally. The scaling approach to kinetic roughening is
generalized to cyclical processes by substituting the time by the number of
cycles $n$. The roughness is predicted to grow as $n^{\beta}$ where $\beta$ is
the cyclical growth exponent. The roughness saturates to a value which scales
with the system size $L$ as $L^{\alpha}$, where $\alpha$ is the cyclical
roughness exponent. The relations between the cyclical exponents and the
corresponding exponents of the primary processes are studied. Exact relations
are found for cycles composed of primary linear processes. An approximate
renormalization group approach is introduced to analyze non-linear effects in
the primary processes. The analytical results are backed by extensive numerical
simulations of different pairs of primary processes, both linear and
non-linear. Experimentally, silver surfaces are grown by a cyclical process
composed of electrodeposition followed by 50% electrodissolution. The roughness
is found to increase as a power-law of $n$, consistent with the scaling
behavior anticipated theoretically. Potential applications of cyclical scaling
include accelerated testing of rechargeable batteries, and improved

cancellation of Witten's global SU(2)_L anomaly requires N_c to be odd, while
the cancellation of triangle anomalies determines the consistent N_c-dependent
values of the quark charges. In this theory, the width of the neutral pion
decay into two photons is not proportional to (N_c)^2. In fact, in the case of
a single generation and hence for two quark flavors (N_f = 2), N_c does not
appear explicitly in the low-energy effective theory of the standard model.
Hence, contrary to common lore, it is impossible to see the number of colors in
low-energy experiments with just pions and photons. For N_f > 2, on the other
hand, N_c explicitly enters the chiral Lagrangian as the quantized prefactor of
the Wess-Zumino-Witten term, but the contribution of this term to photon-pion
vertices is completely canceled by the N_c-dependent part of a
Goldstone-Wilczek term. However, the width of the eta decay into pi^+ pi^-
gamma survives the cancellation and is indeed proportional to (N_c)^2. By
detecting the emerging photon, this process thus allows one to literally see
N_c for N_f > 2.

the deuteron, gamma D -> pi^0 D, at large momentum transfer using the reduced
amplitude formalism. The cluster decomposition of the deuteron wave function at
small binding only allows the nuclear coherent process to proceed if each
nucleon absorbs an equal fraction of the overall momentum transfer.
Furthermore, each nucleon must scatter while remaining close to its mass shell.
Thus the nuclear photoproduction amplitude, M_{gamma D -> pi^0 D}(u,t),
factorizes as a product of three factors: (1) the nucleon photoproduction
amplitude, M_{gamma N_1 -> pi^0 N_1}(u/4,t/4), at half of the overall momentum
transfer, (2) a nucleon form factor, F_{N_2}(t/4), at half the overall momentum
transfer, and (3) the reduced deuteron form factor, f_d(t), which according to
perturbative QCD, has the same monopole falloff as a meson form factor. A
comparison with the recent JLAB data for gamma D -> pi^0 D of Meekins et al.
[Phys. Rev. C 60, 052201 (1999)] and the available gamma p -> pi^0 p data shows
good agreement between the perturbative QCD prediction and experiment over a
large range of momentum transfers and center of mass angles. The reduced
amplitude prediction is consistent with the constituent counting rule, p^11_T
M_{gamma D -> pi^0 D} -> F(theta_cm), at large momentum transfer. This is found
to be consistent with measurements for photon lab energies E_gamma > 3 GeV at
theta_cm=90 degrees and $\elab > 10$ GeV at 136 degrees.

discussing the analytical structure of the vacuum polarization tensor, showing
how Cutkoski's rules and positivity of the spectral function are realized when
non-commutativity does not affect the temporal coordinate. When instead
non-commutativity involves time, we find the presence of extra troublesome
singularities on the $p_0^2$-plane that seem to invalidate the perturbative
unitarity of the theory. The existence of new tachyonic poles, with respect to
the scalar case, is also uncovered. Then we turn our attention to a different
unitarity check in the ordinary theories, namely time exponentiation of a
Wilson loop. We perform a $O(g^4)$ generalization to the (spatial)
non-commutative case of the familiar results in the usual Yang-Mills theory. We
show that exponentiation persists at $O(g^4)$ in spite of the presence of Moyal
phases reflecting non-commutativity and of the singular infrared behaviour

  Statistical Physics', ed. by M. Laessig and A. Valleriani",,,,"nlin.AO cond-mat q-bio.PE",,"  Simulations of the coevolution of many interacting species are performed
using the Webworld model. The model has a realistic set of predator-prey
equations that describe the population dynamics of the species for any
structure of the food web. The equations account for competition between
species for the same resources, and for the diet choice of predators between
alternative prey according to an evolutionarily stable strategy. The set of
species present undergoes long-term evolution due to speciation and extinction
events. We summarize results obtained on the macro-evolutionary dynamics of
speciations and extinctions, and on the statistical properties of the food webs
that are generated by the model. Simulations begin from small numbers of
species and build up to larger webs with relatively constant species number on
average. The rate of origination and extinction of species are relatively high,
but remain roughly balanced throughout the simulations. When a `parent' species
undergoes speciation, the `child' species usually adds to the same trophic
level as the parent. The chance of the child species surviving is significantly
higher if the parent is on the second or third trophic level than if it is on
the first level, most likely due to a wider choice of possible prey for species
on higher levels. Addition of a new species sometimes causes extinction of
existing species. The parent species has a high probability of extinction
because it has strong competition with the new species. Non-parental
competitors of the new species also have a significantly higher extinction
probability than average, as do prey of the new species. Predators of the new
species are less likely than average to become extinct.

investigated within the generalized quantum dynamics (GQD). It is shown that
the GQD provides an extension of Hamiltonian dynamics which can describe the
evolution of systems of hadrons whose interaction is nonlocal in time due to
quark-gluon retardation effects. This is illustrated by the example of the
dynamics of nucleons with internal structure described by a constitute quark
model. It is shown that quark-gluon retardation effects result in an anomalous
off-shell behavior of the two-nucleon amplitudes, and in a lack of continuity
of the evolution operator describing nucleon dynamics; for this reason
low-energy nucleon dynamics is not governed by the Schr{\""o}dinger equation.
This is shown to have substantial effects on the dynamics of many nucleon
systems. It is also shown that the GQD allows one to take into account
retardation effects from quark confinement in describing the short-range part

  quantum paradoxes remain","14 pages, 4 figures","International Journal of Theoretical Physics, 37, 291, 1998.",,,"quant-ph",,"  In the hidden measurement formalism that we develop in Brussels we explain
the quantum structure as due to the presence of two effects, (a) a real change
of state of the system under influence of the measurement and, (b) a lack of
knowledge about a deeper deterministic reality of the measurement process. We
show that the presence of these two effects leads to the major part of the
quantum mechanical structure of a theory where the measurements contain the two
mentioned effects. We present a quantum machine, where we can illustrate in a
simple way how the quantum structure arises as a consequence of the two
effects. We introduce a parameter 'epsilon' that measures the amount of the
lack of knowledge on the measurement process, and by varying this parameter, we
describe a continuous evolution from a quantum structure (maximal lack of
knowledge) to a classical structure (zero lack of knowledge). We show that for
intermediate values of epsilon we find a new type of structure that is neither
quantum nor classical. We analyze the quantum paradoxes and show that they can
be divided into two groups: (1) The group (measurement problem and Schrodingers
cat paradox) where the paradoxical aspects arise mainly from the application of
standard quantum theory as a general theory (e.g. also describing the
measurement apparatus). This type of paradox disappears in the hidden
measurement formalism. (2) A second group collecting the paradoxes connected to
the effect of non-locality (the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox and the
violation of Bell inequalities). We show that these paradoxes are internally
resolved because the effect of non-locality turns out to be a fundamental
property of the hidden measurement formalism itself.

monitors certain observables of the system, destroying interference between the

environment-induced superselection or einselection, a quantum process
associated with selective loss of information. Einselected pointer states are
stable. They can retain correlations with the rest of the Universe in spite of
the environment. Einselection enforces classicality by imposing an effective
ban on the vast majority of the Hilbert space, eliminating especially the
flagrantly non-local ""Schr\""odinger cat"" states. Classical structure of phase
space emerges from the quantum Hilbert space in the appropriate macroscopic
limit: Combination of einselection with dynamics leads to the idealizations of
a point and of a classical trajectory. In measurements, einselection replaces
quantum entanglement between the apparatus and the measured system with the
classical correlation.
