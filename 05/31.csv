cluster 47Tucanae (NGC 104) with the Chandra X-ray Observatory to study the
population of compact binaries in the high stellar density core. A 70 kilosec
exposure of the cluster reveals a centrally concentrated population of faint
(Lx ~10^{30-33} erg/s) x-ray sources, with at least 108 located within the
central 2arcmin X 2.5arcmin and at least half with Lx <10^{30.5} erg/s. All 15
millisecond pulsars (MSPs) recently located precisely by radio observations are
identified, though two are unresolved by Chandra. The x-ray spectral and
temporal characteristics, as well as initial optical identifications with the
Hubble Space Telescope, suggest that >~50% are millisecond pulsars, ~30% are
accreting white dwarfs, ~15% are main sequence binaries in flare outbursts and
only 2 to 3 are quiescent low mass x-ray binaries containing neutron stars, the
conventional progenitors of MSPs. An approximate upper limit of ~470Msun for
the mass of an accreting central black hole in the cluster is derived. These
observations provide the first x-ray ""color-magnitude"" diagram for a globular
cluster and census of its compact object and binary population.

Such compact objects are commonly interpreted as Black Holes (BHs). However, we
point out that while such Black Hole Candidates (BHCs) must be similar to BHs
in many respects they, actually, can not be BHs because existence of Black
Holes would violate the basic tenet of the General Theory of Relativity that
the worldline of a material particle must be TIMELIKE at any regular region of
spacetime. We arrive at this unique conclusion by approaching the problem from
various directions. We feel that such ``operational'' Black Holes could be able
to explain hard X-ray tail found in the galactic BHCs because Lorentz factor of
the plasma accreting on such objects should be considerably higher than the

involving evolution of high temperature plasmas. Unfortunately, calculating an
accurate cooling coefficient generally requires the solution of over a hundred
differential equations to follow the ionization. We discuss here a simple
2-parameter approximation for the cooling coefficient due to elements heavier
than H and He, for the temperature range $T= 10^{4}-10^{8}$K. Tests of the
method show that it successfully tracks the ionization level in severe
dynamical environments, and accurately approximates the non-equilibrium cooling
coefficient of the trace elements, usually to within 10% in all cases for which
cooling is actually important. The error is large only when the temperature is
dropping so rapidly due to expansion that radiative cooling is negligible, but
even in this situation, the ionization level is followed sufficiently
accurately. The current approximation is fully implemented in publicly
available FORTRAN code. A second paper will discuss general approaches to
approximation methods of this type, other realizations which could be even more
accurate, and the potential for extension to calculations of non-equilibrium

unambiguous signatures of recent episodes of star formation within $\approx$300
pc from the nucleus. When we relate this property with the Hubble type of the
host galaxy, we find that the incidence of recent circumnuclear star formation
increases along the Hubble sequence, and seems to be larger than in non-Seyfert
galaxies for the early Hubble types S0 and Sa, but similar to that in
non-Seyfert galaxies for later Hubble types. Both in early-type and late-type
Seyferts, the presence of recent star-formation is related to the galaxy
morphology in the inner few kiloparsecs, as observed in HST images through the
filter F606W by Malkan et al., who has assigned a late ``inner Hubble type'' to
most Seyfert 2s with recent nuclear star-formation. This new classification is
due to the presence of dust lanes and spiral structures in the inner region.
The presence of recent star formation in Seyfert 2 nuclei is also related to
interactions: among the 13 galaxies of the sample with close companions or in
mergers, 9 have recent star formation in the nucleus. These correlations
between the presence of companions, inner morphology and the incidence of
recent star formation suggest an evolutionary scenario in which the interaction
is responsible for sending gas inwards which both feeds the AGN and triggers
star-formation. The starburst then fades with time and the composite Seyfert 2
+ Starburst nucleus evolves to a ``pure'' Seyfert 2 nucleus with an old stellar
population.

  Super Goldreich-Julian Current","13 pages, 9 figures",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We investigate a stationary pair production cascade in the outer
magnetosphere of a spinning neutron star. The charge depletion due to global
flows of charged particles, causes a large electric field along the magnetic
field lines. Migratory electrons and/or positrons are accelerated by this field
to radiate curvature gamma-rays, some of which collide with the X-rays to
materialize as pairs in the gap. The replenished charges partially screen the
electric field, which is self-consistently solved, together with the
distribution functions of particles and gamma-rays. By solving the Vlasov
equations describing this pair production cascade, we demonstrate the existence
of a stationary gap in the outer magnetosphere of PSR B1055-52 for a wide range
of current densities flowing in the accelerator: From sub to super
Goldreich-Julian values. However, we find that the expected GeV spectrum
becomes very soft if the current density exceeds the Goldreich-Julian value. We
also demonstrate that the GeV spectrum softens with decreasing magnetic
inclination and with increasing distance to this pulsar. We thus conclude that
a sub-Goldreich-Julian current, a large magnetic inclination, and a small
distance (500 pc, say) are plausible to account for EGRET observations.
Furthermore, it is found that the TeV flux due to inverse Compton scatterings
of infrared photons whose spectrum is inferred from the Rayleigh-Jeans side of
the soft blackbody spectrum is much less than the observational upper limit.

that the hyperfine ratios of the N=3-2 line are always close to the Local
Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) optically thin values even in the case of
optically thick emission. This is due to different excitation temperatures for
the different hyperfine lines. From the line intensity ratios between the
different CN transitions we derive H_2 densities of ~10^5cm^-3 for the
molecular Ridge and of ~3x10^6cm^-3 for the Trapezium region. The CN column
densities are one order of magnitude larger in the Ridge than in the Trapezium
region, but the CN to H_2 ratio is similar both in the Trapezium and in the

relatively high CN abundances toward the Trapezium region requires that the CN
emission arises from a thin layer with a depth along the line of sight of only

  Review B",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.66.094401",,"cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.str-el",,"  Exact analytic calculations in spin-1/2 XY chains, show the presence of
long-time tails in the asymptotic dynamics of spatially inhomogeneous
excitations. The decay of inhomogeneities, for $t\to \infty $, is given in the
form of a power law \[ (t/\tau_{Q}) ^{-\nu_{Q}} \] where the relaxation time
$\tau_{Q}$ and the exponent $\nu_{Q}$ depend on the wave vector $Q$,
characterizing the spatial modulation of the initial excitation. We consider
several variants of the XY model (dimerized, with staggered magnetic field,
with bond alternation, and with isotropic and uniform interactions), that are
grouped into two families, whether the energy spectrum has a gap or not. Once
the initial condition is given, the non-equilibrium problem for the
magnetization is solved in closed form, without any other assumption. The
long-time behavior for $t\to \infty $ can be obtained systematically in a form
of an asymptotic series through the stationary phase method. We found that
gapped models show critical behavior with respect to $Q$, in the sense that
there exist critical values $Q_{c}$, where the relaxation time $\tau_{Q}$
diverges and the exponent $\nu_{Q}$ changes discontinuously. At those points, a
slowing down of the relaxation process is induced, similarly to phenomena
occurring near phase transitions. Long-lived excitations are identified as
incommensurate spin density waves that emerge in systems undergoing the Peierls
transition. In contrast, gapless models do not present the above anomalies as a
function of the wave vector $Q$.

suggested. A scaling analysis implies a local form of the compressibility sum
rule near a hard wall. A symmetry of the Coulomb system with respect to the
M\""obius conformal transformation, which induces a gravitational source acting
on the particle density, is established. Among the consequences, a universal
term of the finite-size expansion of the grand potential is derived exactly for
a disk geometry of the confining domain.

different in both models. We show that explicitely in this paper.

not imposed. The metric is allowed to have explicit dependence on the ""extra""
coordinate(s). This is the usual scenario in brane-world and space-time-matter
theories. We extend the usual discussion by considering five-dimensional
metrics with off-diagonal terms. We replace the condition of cylindricity by
the requirement that physics in four-dimensional space-time should remain
invariant under changes of coordinates in the five-dimensional bulk. This
invariance does not eliminate physical effects from the extra dimension but
separates them from spurious geometrical ones. We use the appropriate splitting
technique to construct the most general induced energy-momentum tensor,
compatible with the required invariance. It generalizes all previous results in
the literature. In addition, we find two four-vectors, J_{m}^{mu} and
J_{e}^{mu}, induced by off-diagonal metrics, that separately satisfy the usual
equation of continuity in 4D. These vectors appear as source-terms in equations
that closely resemble the ones of electromagnetism. These are Maxwell-like
equations for an antisymmetric tensor {F-hat}_{mu nu} that generalizes the
usual electromagnetic one. This generalization is not an assumption, but
follows naturally from the dimensional reduction. Thus, if {F-hat}_{mu nu}
could be identified with the electromagnetic tensor, then the theory would
predict the existence of classical magnetic charge and current. The splitting
formalism used allows us to construct 4D physical quantities from
five-dimensional ones, in a way that is independent on how we choose our
space-time coordinates from those of the bulk.

kinetic energy of the scalar field greatly exceeds its potential energy
resulting in a `stiff' equation of state for scalar field matter $P_\phi \simeq
\rho_\phi$. The kinetic regime precedes the radiation dominated epoch and
introduces an important new feature into the spectrum of relic gravity waves
created quantum mechanically during inflation. The gravity wave spectrum
increases with wavenumber for wavelengths shorter than the comoving horizon
scale at the commencement of the radiative regime. This `blue tilt' is a
generic feature of models with steep potentials and imposes strong constraints
on a class of inflationary braneworld models. Prospects for detection of the
gravity wave background by terrestrial and space-borne gravity wave
observatories such as LIGO II and LISA are discussed.

calculated as a function of the momentum and energy transfer, q, \nu. At large
values of |q| the response exhibits scaling in the variable y=\nu-|q|, which is
proportional to the Nachtmann variable, \xi. The approach to scaling is studied
at smaller values of |q|. Scaling occurs at \nu~|q| at relatively small |q|,
and its validity extends over the entire \xi range as |q| increases; this
behavior is observed in electron-proton scattering. About 10% of the response
at large |q| is in the timelike region where \nu>|q|, and it is necessary to
include it to fulfill the particle number sum rule. The Gross-Llewellyn Smith
and Gottfried sum rules are discussed in the context of these results.

actinides is found to exhibit a ``beat'' behaviour as a function of the angular
momentum I, forcing us to revise the traditional belief that this staggering
decreases gradually to zero and then remains at this zero value. Various
algebraic models (spf-Interacting Boson Model, spdf-IBM, Vector Boson Model,
Nuclear Vibron Model) are shown to predict in their su(3) limits constant
staggering for this case, being thus unable to describe the ``beat'' behaviour.
An explanation of the ``beat'' behaviour is given in terms of two Dunham
expansions (expansions in terms of powers of I(I+1)) with slightly different
sets of coefficients for the ground state band and the negative parity band,
the difference in the values of the coefficients being attributed to Coriolis
couplings to other negative parity bands. Similar ``beat'' patterns have
already been seen in rotational bands of some diatomic molecules, like AgH.

Theoretical predictions for these observables are evaluated in the framework of
the Kohn Variational Principle using correlated basis functions to expand the
three-nucleon scattering wave function. The two-nucleon Argonne $v_{18}$ and
the three-nucleon Urbana IX potentials are considered. In the proton-deuteron
case, the Coulomb interaction between the two protons is included explicitly
and the results are compared to the experimental data available at

magnetic moment and the longitudinal invariant. For hot ions, variations in
magnetic-field strength over a gyro period can become sufficiently large to
cause breakdown of the adiabatic invariance. The magnetic moment is more
sensitive to perturbations than the longitudinal invariant and there exists an
intermediate regime, super-adiabaticity, where the longitudinal invariant
remains adiabatic, but the magnetic moment does not. The motion of
super-adiabatic ions remains integrable and confinement is thus preserved.
However, above a threshold energy, the longitudinal invariant becomes
non-adiabatic too, and confinement is lost as the motion becomes chaotic. We
predict beam ions in present-day spherical tokamaks to be super-adiabatic but
fusion alphas in proposed burning-plasma spherical tokamaks to be
non-adiabatic.

state propagator in one dimension, starting from path integrals in phase space.
We show that the arbitrariness in the path integral representation, which
follows from the overcompleteness of the coherent states, results in many
different semiclassical limits. We explicitly derive two possible semiclassical
formulae for the propagator, we suggest a third one, and we discuss their
relationships. We also derive an initial value representation for the
semiclassical propagator, based on an initial gaussian wavepacket. It turns out
to be related to, but different from, Heller's thawed gaussian approximation.
It is very different from the Herman--Kluk formula, which is not a correct
semiclassical limit. We point out errors in two derivations of the latter.
Finally we show how the semiclassical coherent state propagators lead to
WKB-type quantization rules and to approximations for the Husimi distributions
of stationary states.
