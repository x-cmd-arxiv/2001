  $\gamma$-rays","Submitted For Publication",,,,"astro-ph hep-ph",,"  Recent observations suggest that $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs) and their
afterglows are produced by jets of highly relativistic cannonballs (CBs),
emitted in supernova (SN) explosions. The CBs, reheated by their collision with
the shell, emit radiation that is collimated along their direction of motion
and Doppler-boosted to the typical few-hundred keV energy of the GRB.
Accompanying the GRB, there should be an intense burst of neutrinos of a few
hundreds of GeV energy, made by the decay of charged pions produced in the
collisions of the CBs with the SN shell . The neutrino beam carries almost all
of the emitted energy, but is much narrower than the GRB beam and should only
be detected in coincidence with the small fraction of GRBs whose CBs are moving
very close to the line of sight. The neutral pions made in the transparent
outskirts of the SN shell decay into energetic $\gamma$-rays (EGRs) of energy
of ${\cal{O}}$(100) GeV. The EGR beam, whose energy fluence is comparable to
that of the companion GRB, is as wide as the GRB beam and should be observable,
in coincidence with GRBs, with existing or planned detectors. We derive in
detail these predictions of the CB model.

(FP) type of relations for disk galaxies. We examine how the changes in model
parameters affect these relations and explore the possibility of using such

the space of their fundamental properties are predicted to be concentrated in a
plane, with the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation (a relation between luminosity $L$
and maximum rotation velocity $V_m$) being an almost edge-on view. Using
rotation velocities at larger radii generally leads to larger TF scatter. In
searching for a third parameter, we find that both the disk scale-length $R_d$
(or surface brightness) and the rotation-curve shape are correlated with the TF
scatter. The FP relation in the $(\Log L, \Log V_m, \Log R_d)$-space obtained
from the theory is $L\propto R_d^{\alpha'} V_m^{\beta'}$, with ${\alpha'}\sim
0.50$ and ${\beta'}\sim 2.60$, consistent with the preliminary result we obtain
from observational data. Among the model parameters we probe, variation in any
of them can generate significant scatter in the TF relation, but the effects of
the spin parameter and halo concentration can be reduced significantly by
introducing $R_d$ while the scatter caused by varying $m_d$ (the ratio between
disk mass and halo mass) is most effectively reduced by introducing the
parameters which describes the rotation-curve shape. The TF and FP relations
combined should therefore provide useful constraints on models of galaxy
formation.

redshift ($z \gtsim 1$) sources correspond to our new calculation. Amongst the
well-identified sources, there is none with an index significantly higher than
predicted. Sources which have an index lower than predicted are either within
the error zone or much lower, the latter presumably having AGN-dominated
radio-continuum emission. We find the median redshift to be $\sim 2$, which is
consistent with that deduced by previous work ($\sim 3$) within the error. We
also discuss the various systematic effects that can affect the accuracy of the
redshift estimate. We examine other methods of redshift estimation, like
photometric ratio in the submillimeter and locating the peak of the SED in the
rest system of the objects. We conclude that while the various methods are
helpful in identifying high-redshift objects and making a crude estimate of the

precipitating electron beam can influence the line profiles of Ly_alpha,
H_alpha, Ca II K and Ca II 8542. We use a model atmosphere of a dMe star and
make non-LTE computations taking into account the non-thermal collisional rates
due to the electron beam. The results show that the four lines can be enhanced
to different extents. The relative enhancement increases with increasing
formation height of the lines. Varying the energy flux of the electron beam has
different effects on the four lines. The wings of Ly_alpha and H_alpha become
increasingly broad with the beam flux; change of the Ca II K and Ca II 8542
lines, however, is most significant in the line centre. Varying the electron
energy (i.e., the low-energy cut-off for a power law beam) has a great
influence on the Ly_alpha line, but little on the H_alpha and Ca II lines. An
electron beam of higher energy precipitates deeper, thus producing less
enhancement of the Ly_alpha line. The Ly_alpha/H_alpha flux ratio is thus
sensitive to the electron energy.

(AMR) technique subdivides the cells which satisfy the refinement criterion
recursively. The hierarchical meshes are maintained by the special data
structure and are modified in accordance with the change of particle
distribution. In general, as the resolution of the simulation increases, its
time step must be shortened and more computational time is required to complete
the simulation. Since the AMR enhances the spatial resolution locally, we
reduce the time step locally also, instead of shortening it globally. For this
purpose we used a technique of hierarchical time steps (HTS) which changes the
time step, from particle to particle, depending on the size of the cell in
which particles reside. Some test calculations show that our implementation of
AMR and HTS is successful. We have performed cosmological simulation runs based

dynamical systems which have strange nonchaotic attractors (SNAs): the dynamics
is asymptotically on fractal attractors and the largest Lyapunov exponent is
nonpositive. Furthermore, we show that quasiperiodic forcing, which has been a
hallmark of essentially allhitherto known examples of such dynamics is {\it
not} necessary for the creation of SNAs.

  numerical examples and general arguments","Phys.Rev. C69 (2004) 044004","10.1103/PhysRevC.69.044004",,"nucl-th",,"  A non-relativistic potential-model version of the factorization assumption,
used in perturbative QCD calculations of hadronic form factors, is used, along
with the Born approximation valid at high energies, to derive a remarkably
simple relationship between the impulse approximation contribution to the
deuteron form factor at high momentum transfer and the high energy
neutron-proton scattering amplitude. The relation states that the form factor
at a given value of $Q^2$ is proportional to the scattering amplitude at a
specific energy and scattering angle. This suggests that an accurate
computation of the form factors at large $Q^2$ requires a simultaneous
description of the phase-shifts at a related energy, a statement that seems
reasonable regardless of any derivation. Our form factor-scattering amplitude
relation is shown to be accurate for some examples. However, if the potential
consists of a strong short distance repulsive term and a strong longer ranged
attractive term, as typically occurs in many realistic potentials, the relation
is found to be accurate only for ridiculously large values of $Q$. More general
arguments, using only the Schroedinger equation, suggest a strong, but
complicated, relationship between the form factor and scattering amplitude.
Furthermore, the use of recently obtained soft potentials, along with an
appropriate current operator, may allow calculations of form factors that are
consistent with the necessary phase shifts.

replacing the usual first derivative coupling potential by a new,
second-derivative coupling potential. This paper first shows and discusses the
limitation of the standard coupled-channels theory in the case where one of the
nuclei in the reaction is strongly deformed. Then, this new approach is shown
to improve consistently the agreement with the experimental data: the elastic
scattering, single-2$^{+}$ and mutual-2$^{+}$ excitation inelastic scattering
data as well as their 90$^{\circ}$ elastic and inelastic excitation functions
with little energy-dependent potentials. This new approach makes major
improvement on all the previous coupled-channels calculations for this system.

experiments in which individual quantum systems are monitored and manipulated
in real time. The advent of such new technical capabilities provides strong
motivation for the development of theoretical and experimental methodologies
for quantum feedback control. The availability of such methods would enable
radically new approaches to experimental physics in the quantum realm.
Likewise, the investigation of quantum feedback control will introduce crucial
new considerations to control theory, such as the uniquely quantum phenomena of
entanglement and measurement back-action. The extension of established analysis
techniques from control theory into the quantum domain may also provide new
insight into the dynamics of complex quantum systems. We anticipate that the
successful formulation of an input-output approach to the analysis and
reduction of large quantum systems could have very general applications in
non-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics and in the nascent field of
quantum information theory.

large the dimensions of the parent states are. For the rest of the special
cases of deterministic LOCC transformations, we show that the dimension of the
auxiliary entangled state depends on the presence of equalities in the
majorization relations of the parent states. We show that genuine recovery is
still possible using auxiliary states in dimensions less than that of the
parent states for all patterns of majorization relations except only one
special case.
