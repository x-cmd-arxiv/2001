nucleons nu + N -> N + nu. If these collisions are taken to be iso-energetic as
in all numerical supernova simulations, the neutrino flux spectrum escaping to
infinity depends only on the medium temperature T_ES and the thermally averaged
optical depth tau_ES at the energy sphere. For tau_ES = 10-50 one finds for the
spectral flux temperature of the escaping neutrinos T_flux = 0.5-0.6 T_ES.
Including energy exchange (nucleon recoil) in nu + N -> N + nu can shift T_flux
both up or down. Delta T_flux depends on tau_ES, on the scattering atmosphere's
temperature profile, and on T_ES. Based on a numerical study we find that for
typical conditions Delta T_flux/T_flux is between -10% and -20%, and even for
extreme parameter choices does not exceed -30%. The exact value of Delta
T_flux/T_flux is surprisingly insensitive to the assumed value of the nucleon
mass, i.e. the exact efficiency of energy transfer between neutrinos and
nucleons is not important as long as it can occur at all. Therefore,
calculating the nu_mu and nu_tau spectra does not seem to require a precise
knowledge of the nuclear medium's dynamical structure functions.

rate of $\sim 10 {\rm yr^{-1}}$, may be evaporating primordial black holes
(PBHs). Calculations of the present PBH evaporation rate have traditionally
assumed that the PBH mass function varies as $M_{{\rm BH}}^{-5/2}$. This mass
function only arises if the density perturbations from which the PBHs form have
a scale invariant power spectrum. It is now known that for a scale invariant
power spectrum, normalised to COBE on large scales, the PBH density is
completely negligible, so that this mass function is cosmologically irrelevant.
For non-scale-invariant power spectra, if all PBHs which form at given epoch
have a fixed mass then the PBH mass function is sharply peaked around that
mass, whilst if the PBH mass depends on the size of the density perturbation
from which it forms, as is expected when critical phenomena are taken into
account, then the PBH mass function will be far broader than $ M_{{\rm
BH}}^{-5/2}$. In this paper we calculate the present day PBH evaporation rate,
using constraints from the diffuse gamma-ray background, for both of these mass
functions. If the PBH mass function has significant finite width, as recent
numerical simulations suggest, then it is not possible to produce a present day
PBH evaporation rate comparable with the observed short period gamma-ray burst
rate. This could also have implications for other attempts to detect
evaporating PBHs.

distinguished from the Fe K_alpha line properties of some other possible

BBHs in AGNs. The Fe K_alpha line profile associated with BBHs may also provide
a tool to investigate the dynamics in strong gravitation field (e.g. providing

in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and a homogeneous plane-parallel or
spherically symmetric geometry. The energy balance requires particular
attention, as two elements which are particularly difficult to model play an
important role: line blanketing and convection. Inversion techniques are able
to bypass the difficulties of a detailed description of the energy balance.
Assuming that the atmosphere is in hydrostatic equilibrium and LTE, it is
possible to constrain its structure from spectroscopic observations. Among the
most serious approximations still implicit in the method is a static and
homogeneous geometry. In this paper, we take advantage of a realistic
three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamical simulation of the solar surface to
check the systematic errors incurred by an inversion assuming a plane-parallel
horizontally-homogeneous atmosphere. The thermal structure recovered resembles
the spatial and time average of the three-dimensional atmosphere. Furthermore,
the abundances retrieved are typically within 10% (0.04 dex) of the abundances
used to construct the simulation. The application to a fairly complete dataset
from the solar spectrum provides further confidence in previous analyses of the
solar composition. There is only a narrow range of one-dimensional thermal
structures able to fit the absorption lines in the spectrum of the Sun. With
our carefully selected dataset, random errors are about a factor of two smaller
than systematic errors. A small number of strong metal lines can provide very
reliable results. We foresee no major difficulty in applying the technique to
other similar stars, and obtaining similar accuracies, using spectra with a
resolving power about 50,000 and a signal-to-noise ratio as low as 30.

the higher polarization fractions imply a highly ordered magnetic field in the
fine structure and low differential Faraday rotation in the intervening cluster
gas. The optical identification of host galaxies remains problematic. In A85,
A133 and A4038 the travel times for the brightest cluster galaxies are
significantly longer than the modeled ages of the relics and nearby bright
ellipticals provide a better match. Excess X-ray emission in the 0.5 keV-to-2
keV band was found near the relics in A85 and A133. The surface brightness was
too high to be attributed to the inverse-Compton mechanism alone. We found
excellent fits to the broad-band radio spectra using the anisotropic (KGKP)
model of spectral ageing, and we have extended the model to include diffusion
of particles between regions of different field strength (the Murgia-JP, or
MJP, model). The steep radio spectra imply ages for the relics of ~ 10^8 yr, at
the start of which period their radio luminosities would have been ~ 10^25 W/Hz
at 1.4 GHz.

observations. The images show the ``southern streamer,'' ``50 km/s cloud,'' and
new features including a ``western streamer'', 6 parsecs in length, and a
``northern ridge'' which connects to the CND. NH3(3,3) emission is very similar
to 1.2 mm dust emission indicating that NH3 traces column density well. Ratios
of the NH3(2,2) to (1,1) line intensities give an estimate of the temperature
of the gas and indicate high temperatures close to the nucleus and CND. The new
data cover a velocity range of 270 km/s, including all velocities observed in
the CND, with a resolution of 9.8 km/s. Previous NH3 observations with higher
resolution did not cover the entire range of velocities seen in the CND. The
large-scale kinematics of the CND do not resemble a coherent ring or disk. We
see evidence for a high velocity cloud within a projected distance of 50'' (2
pc) which is only seen in NH3(3,3) and is likely to be hot. Comparison to 6 cm
continuum emission reveals that much of the NH3 emission traces the outer edges
of Sgr A East and was probably pushed outward by this expanding shell. The
connection between the northern ridge (which appears to be swept up by Sgr A
East) and the CND indicates that Sgr A East and the CND are in close proximity
to each other. Kinematic evidence for these connections is presented in this

logical depth of producing a Bak-Sneppen history is exponentially less than the

critical state of the Bak-Sneppen model has long range correlations in time and

dependent. The parallel dynamics for generating Bak-Sneppen histories is

the bond-energy with respect to h a specific-heat like quantity is obtained,
which does not appear to diverge at the critical point but rather exhibits a
cusp. We also consider the effect of a small uniform magnetic field, which
allows us to calculate the T=0 susceptibility. From a finite-size scaling
analysis, we obtain the critical exponents \nu=1.32(7), \alpha=-0.63(7),
\eta=0.50(3) and find that the critical strength of the random field is
h_c=2.28(1). We discuss the significance of the result that \alpha appears to
be strongly negative.

polycrystalline MgB2. Both TEM and x-ray data reveal that MgO is the major
second-phase in our bulk samples. Although MgB2 and MgO have different crystal
symmetries, being P6/mmm and Fm-3m, respectively, their stacking sequence of Mg
and B (or O) and lattice spacings in certain crystallographic orientations are
very similar. The size of MgO varies from 10~500nm, and its mismatch with the
MgB2 matrix can be a source for dislocations. Dislocations in MgB2 often have a
Burgers vector of <100>. 1/3<1-10> and 1/3<210> partial dislocations and their
associated stacking faults were also observed. Since both dislocations and
stacking faults are located in the (001) basal plane, flux pinning anisotropy
is expected. Diffuse scattering analysis suggests that the correlation length
along the c-axis for defect-free basal planes is about 50nm. (001) twist
grain-boundaries, formed by rotations along the c-axis, are major grain
boundaries in MgB2 as a result of the out-of-plane weak bonding between Mg and
B atoms. An excess of Mg was observed in some grain boundaries. High-resolution
nano-probe EELS reveals that there is a difference in near edge structure of
the boron K-edge acquired from grain boundaries and grain interiors. The change
at the edge threshold may be suggestive of variation of the hole concentration
that would significantly alter boundary superconductivity.

area e^{S(E,N,V)} of the manifold of constant energy in the N-body phase space.
  From the principle all thermodynamics and especially all phenomena of phase
transitions and critical phenomena can be deduced. The topology of the
curvature matrix C(E,N) (Hessian) of S(E,N) determines regions of pure phases,
regions of phase separation, and (multi-)critical points and lines. Thus,
C(E,N) describes all kind of phase-transitions with all their flavor. They are
linked to convex (upwards bending) intruders of S(E,N), here the canonical
ensemble defined by the Laplace transform to the intensive variables becomes
non-local and violates the basic conservation laws (it mixes widely different
conserved quantities). Thus Statistical Mechanics becomes a geometric theory
addressing the whole ensemble or the manifold of all points in phase space
which are consistent with the few macroscopic conserved control parameters.
Moreover, this interpretation leads to a straight derivation of irreversibility
and the Second Law of Thermodynamics out of the time-reversible microscopic
mechanical dynamics. It is the whole ensemble that spreads irreversibly over
the accessible phase space not the single N-body trajectory. This is all
possible without invoking the thermodynamic limit, extensivity, or concavity of
S(E,N,V) and also without invoking any cosmological constraints. It is further
shown that non-extensive Hamiltonian systems at equilibrium are described by
Boltzmann's principle and not by Tsallis non-extensive statistics.

potential has been extracted in a global analysis of $e^+e^-$, $p+p$, $p+

demonstrate that the temperature at $\mu_B$=0, rises with the initial energy
density $\epsilon_i$, and saturates above $\epsilon_i$ $\sim$ 1 GeV/fm$^3$.
This behaviour is interpreted as mapping out the QCD phase transition
universally in particle and nuclear collisions. The critical energy density is
therefore identified to be $\epsilon_{crit}$ $\sim$ 1 $\pm$ 0.3 GeV/fm$^3$. We
show that strange particles at $\mu_B$=0, are not significantly enhanced in A+A
collisions as compared to $p+ \overline{p}$. The so called 'strangeness
suppression factor' ($\lambda_s = \frac{(2 \overline{s})} {(\overline{u} +
\overline{d})}$) as a function of $\epsilon_i$ is following the temperature,
rising and saturating universally above $\epsilon_{crit}$. This leads to a
reinterpretation of strangeness enhancement as QGP signature. Within this
interpretation the experimental puzzles with respect to strangeness production
can be naturally explained: e.g. the recent measured maximum of $K^+/\pi^+$ in
Pb+Pb collisions at 40 A GeV, is explained as due to $\mu_B$. We discuss under
which conditions 'strangeness enhancement' and '$J/\Psi$ suppresion' both set
in at $\epsilon_{crit}$ $\sim$ 1 GeV/fm$^3$.

that some constructions of the theory of formal group may be generalized to

a Hopf algebra $(H,\mu,\nu, \Delta,\epsilon, S)$ over a ring $R$ without
torsion, then there exists a logarithm, i.e. the formal series ${\frak g}(x)\in
H_\mathbb{Q}[[x]]$ such that $(\Delta {\frak g})({\frak F}(x\otimes 1,1\otimes

both cubic and quintic terms. The model has straightforward realizations in
both temporal and spatial domains, the latter being most realistic. Two
different families of zero-velocity solitons, which are separated by a border
at which solitons do not exist, are found in an exact analytical form. One
family may be regarded as a generalization of the usual BG solitons supported
by the cubic nonlinearity, while the other family, dominated by the quintic
nonlinearity, includes novel ``two-tier'' solitons with a sharp (but
nonsingular) peak. These soliton families also differ in the parities of their
real and imaginary parts. A stability region is identified within each family
by means of direct numerical simulations. The addition of the quintic term to
the model makes the solitons very robust: simulating evolution of a strongly
deformed pulse, we find that a larger part of its energy is \emph{retained} in
the process of its evolution into a soliton shape, only a small share of the
energy being lost into radiation, which is opposite to what occurs in the usual
BG model with cubic nonlinearity.
