theory, the inertia (I) and shear (T) tensors, using a cosmological N-body
simulation with thousands of well-resolved haloes. We find that the principal
axes of I and T are strongly aligned, even though I characterizes the
proto-halo locally while T is determined by the large-scale structure. Thus,
the resultant galactic spin, which plays a key role in galaxy formation, is
only a residual due to ~10 per cent deviations from perfect alignment of T and
I. The T-I correlation induces a weak tendency for the proto-halo spin to be
perpendicular to the major axes of T and I, but this correlation is erased by
non-linear effects at late times, making the observed spins poor indicators of
the initial shear field. However, the T-I correlation implies that the shear
tensor can be used for identifying the positions and boundaries of proto-haloes
in cosmological initial conditions -- a missing piece in galaxy formation
theory. The typical configuration is of a prolate proto-halo lying
perpendicular to a large-scale high-density ridge, with the surrounding voids
inducing compression along the major and intermediate inertia axes of the
proto-halo. This leads to a transient sub-halo filament along the large-scale
ridge, whose sub-clumps then flow along the filament and merge into the final
halo. The centres of proto-haloes tend to lie in ~1 sigma over-density regions,
but their association with linear density maxima smoothed on galactic scales is
vague: only ~40 per cent of the proto-haloes contain peaks within them. Several
other characteristics distinguish proto-haloes from density peaks, e.g., they
tend to compress along two principal axes while many peaks compress along three
axes.

because various new observations (from X-rays to radio wavelengths) have become
available in the past several years. Quantitative comparisons are made between
the positions of the star clusters (broken into three age groups) and the
properties of the interstellar medium by calculating the two-point correlation
functions. We find that young star clusters are distributed in a clustered
fashion. The youngest star clusters are associated with molecular cloud
complexes with characteristic radii of about 1 kpc. In addition, there is a
weak tendency for them to be found in regions with higher HI velocity
dispersions. No dominant triggering mechanism is identified for the majority of
the clusters in the Antennae. Feedback from young bright cluster complexes show
large H_alpha bubbles and H_alpha velocity gradients in shells around the
complexes. We estimate the current star formation rate to be 20 solar mass/yr,
and the gas consumption timescale to be 700 Myr. The latter is comparable to
the merging time scale and indicates that star formation has been enchanced by
the merger event. Finally, we find that the Schmidt law, with index N=-1.4, is
also a good description of the cluster formation triggered by merging in the

law at scales below 1 kpc.

correspond to perturbations around a circular gaussian. They are also the

to use the powerful formalism developed for this problem. Among their
remarkable properties, they are invariant under Fourier transforms (up to a
rescaling), leading to an analytic form for convolutions. The generator of
linear transformations such as translations, rotations, shears and dilatations
can be written as simple combinations of raising and lowering operators. We
derive analytic expressions for practical quantities, such as the centroid
(astrometry), flux (photometry) and radius of the object, in terms of its
shapelet coefficients. We also construct polar basis functions which are
eigenstates of the angular momentum operator, and thus have simple properties
under rotations. As an example, we apply the method to Hubble Space Telescope
images, and show that the small number of shapelet coefficients required to
represent galaxy images lead to compression factors of about 40 to 90. We
discuss applications of shapelets for the archival of large photometric

reliable weak shear measurements. It is based on the Shapelet basis function
formalism of Refregier (2001), in which galaxy images are decomposed into
several shape components, each providing independent estimates of the local
shear. The formalism affords an efficient modelling and deconvolution of the
Point Spread Function. Using the remarkable properties of Shapelets under
distortions, we construct a simple, minimum variance estimator for the shear.
We describe how we implement the method in practice, and test the method using
realistic simulated images. We find our method to be stable and reliable for
conditions analogous to ground-based surveys. Compared to earlier methods, our
method has the advantages of being accurate, linear, mathematically
well-defined, and optimally sensitive, since it uses the full shape information

X-ray transient SAX J1711.6-3808 during its 2001 outburst using data obtained
with the RXTE. We also investigate the correlations between those source
properties and the 3-20 keV X-ray luminosity. The behavior of the source during
the observations can be divided into two distinct state types. During the hard
state, the energy spectra are relatively hard and can be described by only a
power-law component, and the characteristic frequencies (i.e., the frequency of
the 1-7 Hz QPOs observed for the first time in this source) in the power
spectra are low. However, during the ``soft'' state, the spectra are
considerably softer (in addition to the power-law component, a soft component
is necessary to fit the spectra) and the frequencies are the highest observed.
Remarkably, this distinction into two separate states cannot be extrapolated to
also include the 3-20 keV X-ray luminosity. Except for one observation, this
luminosity steadily decreased but the hard state was observed both at the
highest and lowest observed luminosities. In contrast, the soft state occurred
only at intermediate luminosities. This clearly demonstrates that the state
behavior of SAX J1711.6-3808 is decoupled from its X-ray luminosity and that if
the X-ray luminosity traces the accretion rate in SAX J1711.6-3808, then the
state transitions are not good accretion rate indicators, or vice versa. The
data of SAX J1711.6-3808 does not allow us to conclusively determine its exact
nature. The source resembles both neutron star and black hole systems when they
have low luminosities. We discuss our results with respect to the correlated

MOND to two independent physical systems: Ly-alpha absorbers and galaxy

absorbers are somewhat smaller than in Newtonian gravity with dark matter, but
the result depends crucially on the (unknown) background acceleration field in
which they are embedded. In clusters MOND appears to explain the observed

enclosed mass profiles and the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, MOND
predicts radial temperature profiles which disagree badly with observations. We
show this explicitly for the Virgo, Abell 2199 and Coma clusters, but the
results are general, and seem very difficult to avoid. If this discrepancy is
to be resolved by positing additional (presumably baryonic) dark matter, then
this dark matter must have ~1-3 times the cluster gas mass within 1 Mpc. This
result strongly disfavors MOND as an alternative to dark matter (Abridged).

two-temperature accretion flow onto a rotating neutron star or any other
rotating compact star with a surface. We assume Coulomb coupling between the
protons and electrons, and free-free cooling from the electrons. Outside a thin
boundary layer, where the accretion flow meets the star, we show that there is
an extended settling region which is well-described by two self-similar
solutions: (i) a two-temperature solution which is valid in an inner zone
$r\le10^{2.5}$ ($r$ is in Schwarzchild units), and (ii) a one-temperature
solution at larger radii. In both zones, $\rho\propto r^{-2}, \Omega\propto
r^{-3/2}, v\propto r^0, T_p\propto r^{-1}$; in the two-temperature zone,
$T_e\propto r^{-1/2}$. The luminosity of the settling zone arises from the
rotational energy of the star as the star is braked by viscosity. Hence the
luminosity and the flow parameters (density, temperature, angular velocity) are
independent of $\dot M$. The settling solution described here is not
advection-dominated, and is thus different from the self-similar ADAF found
around black holes. When the spin of the star is small enough, however, the
present solution transforms smoothly to a (settling) ADAF.
  We carried out a stability analysis of the settling flow. The flow is
convectively and viscously stable and is unlikely to have strong winds or
outflows. Unlike another cooling-dominated system --- the SLE disk, --- the
settling flow is thermally stable provided that thermal conduction is taken
into account. This strong saturated-like thermoconduction does not change the
structure of the flow.

close-in binary companions by using microlensing. This method utilizes a
caustic-crossing binary lens event with a source also composed of binary stars,
where the companion is a faint star. Detection of the companion is possible
because the flux of the companion can be highly amplified when it crosses the
lens caustic. The detection is facilitated since the companion is more
amplified than the primary because it, in general, has a smaller size than the
primary, and thus experiences less finite source effect. The method is
extension of the previous one suggested to detect close-in giant planets by
Graff & Gaudi (2000) and Lewis & Ibata (2000) and further developed by Ashton &
Lewis (2001). From the simulations of realistic Galactic bulge events, we find
that companions of K-type main sequence or brighter can be efficiently detected

method. We also find that compared to the method of detecting lens companions
for which the efficiency drops significantly for binaries with separations

important advantage of being able to detect companions with substantially

Keplerian structure whose peak emission occurs within several Schwarzschild
radii (r_S=2GM/c^2) of the black hole. The Chandra X-ray counterpart, if
confirmed, is presumably the self-Comptonized component from this region. In
this paper, we suggest that sub-mm timing observations could yield a signal
corresponding to the period P_0 of the marginally stable orbit, and therefore
point directly to the black hole's spin a. Sgr A*'s mass is now known to be
(2.6\pm 0.2)\times 10^6 M_\odot (an unusually accurate value for supermassive
black hole candidates), for which 2.7 min<P_0<36 min, depending on the value of
a and whether the Keplerian flow is prograde or retrograde. A Schwarzschild
black hole (a=0) should have P_0 ~ 20 min. The identification of the orbital
frequency with the innermost stable circular orbit is made feasible by the
transition from optically thick to thin emission at sub-mm wavelengths. With
stratification in the emitter, the peak of the sub-mm bump in Sgr A*'s spectrum
is thus produced at the smallest radius. We caution, however, that theoretical
uncertainties in the structure of the emission region may still produce some
ambiguity in the timing signal. Given that Sgr A*'s flux at $\nu\sim 1$ mm is
several Jy, these periods should lie within the temporal-resolving capability
of sub-mm telescopes using bolometric detectors. A determination of P_0 should
provide not only a value of a, but it should also define the angular momentum
vector of the orbiting gas in relation to the black hole's spin axis. In
addition, since the X-ray flux detected by Chandra appears to be the
self-Comptonized mm to sub-mm component, these temporal fluctuations may also
be evident in the X-ray signal.

the behaviour of PKS 1622-297 at lower gamma-ray energies. The blazar is
significantly (5.7 sigma) detected by COMPTEL at energies above 10 MeV. Below
10 MeV the source is only marginally (3-10 MeV band) or not (below 3 MeV)
detected. The summed MeV spectrum shows a 'hard' (alpha < 2, ~ E^(-alpha))

at MeV energies is indicated. We present the COMPTEL results (light curves,

tremendously; high signal-to-noise images of the effect (at low microwave
frequencies) can now be obtained by interferometric arrays. In the near future,
high frequency measurements of the effect will be made with ground based and
balloon-borne telescopes equipped with bolometeric arrays. Towards the end of
the decade the PLANCK satellite will carry out an extensive S-Z survey over a
wide frequency range. Along with the improved observational capabilities, the
theoretical description of the effect, and its use as a precise cosmological

nature and significance of the effect, its exact theoretical description, the
current observational status, and prospects for the near future.

analyze the two components A1 and A2 of the brightest super star cluster NGC
1569-A. This cluster received previous attention due to the simultaneous
presence of Wolf-Rayet stars and red supergiants. The FOS spectra provide the
first evidence for O-stars in NGC 1569-A, indicating a young (5 Myr) stellar
component in A1 and/or A2. Comparison with other high-mass star-forming regions
suggests that the O- and Wolf-Rayet stars are spatially coincident. If so,
cluster A2 could be the host of the very young O- and Wolf-Rayet population,
and the somewhat older red supergiants could be predominantly located in A1.
The mass-to-light ratio of NGC 1569-A1 is analyzed in five optical and infrared
photometric bands and compared to evolutionary synthesis models. No indications
for an anomalous initial mass function are found, consistent with a scenario
where this cluster is the progenitor of present-day globular clusters. The

complementary schemes (i) a constrained Gaussian random field linear approach
and (ii) a more general non-linear explicit Bayesian deconvolution method which
offers in particular the possibility to constrain the parameters of the
equation of state for the gas. While relying on prior assumption for the
two-point correlation functions, we show how to recover, at least
qualitatively, the 3D topology of the large scale structures in redshift space
by inverting a suitable network of adjacent, low resolution lines of sight. We
also discuss the inversion of single lines of sight observed at high spectral
resolution. Our preliminary investigations suggest that the explicit Bayesian
method can be used to derive quantitative information on the physical state of
the gas. Redshift distortion is considered by simultaneous constrained
reconstruction of the velocity and the density field in real space while
assuming statistical correlation between the two fields. The method seems to
work well in the strong prior regime where peculiar velocities are assumed to
be the most likely realization in the density field. Finally, we investigate
the effect of line of sight separation and number of lines of sight. Our
analyses suggest that multiple low resolution lines of sight could be used to
improve most likely velocity reconstruction on a high resolution line of sight.

the lack of central images in radio lenses implies that the central densities

multi-channel parallel adaptation for rule discovery. This theory is
distinguished from the familiar parallel-distributed adaptation theory of
neural networks in terms of channel-based convergence to the target rules. We
show how to realize this theory in a learning system named CFRule. CFRule is a
parallel weight-based model, but it departs from traditional neural computing
in that its internal knowledge is comprehensible. Furthermore, when the model
converges upon training, each channel converges to a target rule. The model
adaptation rule is derived by multi-level parallel weight optimization based on
gradient descent. Since, however, gradient descent only guarantees local
optimization, a multi-channel regression-based optimization strategy is
developed to effectively deal with this problem. Formally, we prove that the
CFRule model can explicitly and precisely encode any given rule set. Also, we
prove a property related to asynchronous parallel convergence, which is a
critical element of the multi-channel parallel adaptation theory for rule
learning. Thanks to the quantizability nature of the CFRule model, rules can be
extracted completely and soundly via a threshold-based mechanism. Finally, the
practical application of the theory is demonstrated in DNA promoter recognition
and hepatitis prognosis prediction.

self-force experienced by a test mass particle moving in a black hole
spacetime. The method---equally effective for either weak or strong field
orbits---employs the {\em mode-sum regularization scheme} previously developed
for a scalar toy model. The starting point for the calculation, in this
approach, is the formal expression for the regularized self-force derived by
Mino et al. (and, independently, by Quinn and Wald), which involves a worldline
integral over the tail part of the retarded Green's function. This force is
decomposed into multipole (tensor harmonic) modes, whose sum is subjected to a
carefully designed regularization procedure. This procedure involves an
analytic derivation of certain ``regularization parameters'' by means of a
local analysis of the Green's function. This manuscript contains the following
main parts: (1) Introduction of the mode sum scheme as applied to the
gravitational case. (2) Two simple cases studied: the test case of a static
particle in flat spacetime, and the case of a particle at a turning point of a
radial geodesic in Schwarzschild spacetime. In both cases we derive all
necessary regularization parameters. (3) An Analytic foundation is set for
applying the scheme in more general cases. (In this paper, the mode sum scheme
is formulated within the harmonic gauge. The implementation of the scheme in
other gauges shall be discussed in a separate, forthcoming paper.)

is an induced cosmological constant in the 4D sub-manifold. We derive the
general form of the 5D Killing vectors and relate them to the 4D Killing
vectors of the embedded spacetime. We then study the 5D null geodesic paths and
show that the 4D part of the motion can be timelike -- that is, massless
particles in 5D can be massive in 4D. We find that if the null trajectories are
affinely parameterized in 5D, then the particle is subject to an anomalous
acceleration or fifth force. However, this force may be removed by
reparameterization, which brings the correct definition of the proper time into
question. Physical properties of the geodesics -- such as rest mass variations
induced by a variable cosmological ``constant'', constants of the motion and 5D
time-dilation effects -- are discussed and are shown to be open to experimental
or observational investigation.

limiting cases. We find that if the SUSY mass parameters are large and of the
same order, the one loop SUSY-QCD corrections {\it do not decouple}. The
non-decoupling contribution is enhanced by \tan \beta and therefore large
corrections are expected in the large \tan \beta limit. In contrast, we also
find that the SUSY-QCD corrections decouple if the masses of either the squarks
or the gluinos are separately taken large.

scroll X. In particular the author describes explicitly the group of divisorial
sheaves associated to Weil divisors on X, via the direct image of the Picard
group of the canonical resolution of X, which is very well known.
  The analysis naturally splits in two cases, depending on the codimension of
the vertex of X (>2 or =2). When the codimension of the vertex is >2, then the
two groups are isomorphic and there is a natural intersection form in X
inherited from the one in the canonical resolution. When the codimension of the
vertex is 2 this is no longer true and to overcome this problem the author
introduces the concept of integral total transform of a divisor in the
resolution of X. In this case the author defines a (non-linear) intersection
number of two divisors, that represents the degree of their scheme-theoretic
intersection if they are effective with no common components. Lastly there are
some examples and applications.

there is a `gap in the spectrum' of possible growth rates between being bounded

being an ideal crystal. Explicitly, for N(T), if R is the covering radius of X
then either N(T) is bounded or N(T) >= T/2R for all T>0. The constant 1/2R in
this bound is best possible in all dimensions. For M(T), either M(T) is bounded

zero temperature acting on the boundary atoms of chains of classical anharmonic
oscillators. Time-dependent perturbation theory allows us to obtain an explicit
solution of the harmonic problem: even in such a simple system nontrivial
features emerge from the interplay of the different decay rates of Fourier
modes. In particular, a crossover from an exponential to an inverse-square-root
law occurs on a time scale proportional to the system size $N$. A further
crossover back to an exponential law is observed only at much longer times (of
the order $N^3$). In the nonlinear chain, the relaxation process is initially
equivalent to the harmonic case over a wide time span, as illustrated by
simulations of the $\beta$ Fermi-Pasta-Ulam model. The distinctive feature is
that the second crossover is not observed due to the spontaneous appearance of
breathers, i.e. space-localized time-periodic solutions, that keep a finite
residual energy in the lattice. We discuss the mechanism yielding such
solutions and also explain why it crucially depends on the boundary conditions.

Generating from a generation yields zero. The boundary of a boundary is zero. A
boundary is closed. A generation is sterile. A conjugation is considered. The
conjugation converts closed forms to sterile forms and back. It permits to
construct chains of forms. The conjunction differs from the Hodge star

considering a cavity moving in vacuum in a monodimensional space. The cavity is
an open system which emits photons when it oscillates in vacuum. Qualitatively
new effects like pulse shaping in the time domain and frequency conversion in
the spectrum may help to discrimate motion-induced radiation from potential
stray effects.

we study the influence of finite conductivity of metals on the Casimir effect.
The correction to the Casimir force and energy due to imperfect reflection and
finite temperature are evaluated for plane metallic plates where the dielectric
functions of the metals are modeled by a plasma model. The results are compared
with the common approximation where conductivity and thermal corrections are
evaluated separately and simply multiplied.

  Robert Russell et al",,,,"quant-ph",,"  This paper assesses the Everettian approach to the measurement problem,
especially the version of that approach advocated by Simon Saunders and David
Wallace. I emphasise conceptual, indeed metaphysical, aspects rather than
technical ones; but I include an introductory exposition of decoherence. In
particular, I discuss whether -- as these authors maintain -- it is acceptable
to have no precise definition of 'branch' (in the Everettian kind of sense).

prediction of quantum theory. These fluctuations have many observable
consequences, like the Casimir effect which is now measured with good accuracy
and agreement with theory, provided that the latter accounts for differences
between real experiments and the ideal situation considered by Casimir. But the
vacuum energy density calculated by adding field mode energies is much larger
than the density observed around us through gravitational phenomena. This
``vacuum catastrophe'' is one of the unsolved problems at the interface between
quantum theory on one hand, inertial and gravitational phenomena on the other
hand. It is however possible to put properly formulated questions in the
vicinity of this paradox. These questions are directly connected to observable
effects bearing upon the principle of relativity of motion in quantum vacuum.

Hamiltonians and real spectra. We set up a general framework for the analysis
of such systems in terms of Hermitian Hamiltonians defined in the usual Hilbert
space $L_2(-\infty,\infty)$. Special emphasis is put on the correct definition
of the algebra of physical observables. Within this scheme we consider various
examples, including the model recently introduced by Cannata et al. and the
model of Hatano and Nelson.
