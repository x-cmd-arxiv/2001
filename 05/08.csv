performing a series of statistical tests. With a few minor caveats, our answer
is yes, and we compress all data into a single set of 24 bandpowers with

allow us to compare the excursion set predictions associated with spherical and
ellipsoidal collapse. In particular, we present formulae for the universal
unconditional mass function of bound objects and the conditional mass function
which describes the mass function of the progenitors of haloes in a given mass
range today. We show that the ellipsoidal collapse based moving barrier model
provides a better description of what we measure in the numerical simulations
than the spherical collapse based constant barrier model, although the
agreement between model and simulations is better at large lookback times. Our
results for the conditional mass function can be used to compute accurate
approximations to the local-density mass function which quantifies the tendency
for massive haloes to populate denser regions than less massive haloes. This
happens because low density regions can be thought of as being collapsed haloes
viewed at large lookback times, whereas high density regions are collapsed
haloes viewed at small lookback times. Although we have only applied our
analytic formulae to two simple barrier shapes, we show that they are, in fact,
accurate for a wide variety of moving barriers. We suggest how they can be used

the prediction of early filamentary structure formation in a Cold Dark Matter

Lyman Break galaxies are too rare to be used as tracers of filaments and we
argue that to map out filaments in the high z universe, one will need to
identify classes of objects fainter than those currently accessible via the
Lyman Break technique. Objects selected via their Ly-alpha emission, and/or as
DLA absorbers, populate the faintest accessible part of the high redshift
galaxy luminosity function, and as such make up good candidates for objects
which will map out high redshift filaments. Here we present the first direct
detection of a filament (at z=3.04) mapped by those classes of objects. The
observations are the deepest yet to have been done in Ly-alpha imaging at high
redshift, and they reveal a single string of proto-galaxies spanning about 5
Mpc (20 Mpc comoving). Expanding the cosmological test proposed by Alcock &
Paczynski (1979), we outline how observations of this type can be used to
determine Omega_Lambda at z=3.

on average, the spin amplitudes of today's virialized haloes if linear growth
is assumed until ~t_0/3, or 55-70 per cent of the halo effective turn-around

properties of galaxies, such as total spin and angular-momentum distribution

Non-linear changes in spin direction cause a mean error of ~50 degrees in the

questions the usefulness of TTT for predicting intrinsic alignments in the

$\Gamma=1.56\pm0.18$, flatter that the average spectral index of bright QSOs
and consistent with the spectrum of the X-ray background in this band. The flat
spectrum in the \asca band could be explained by only a moderate absorption
($\sim 10^{22} \rm cm^{-2}$) assuming the typical AGN spectrum ie a power-law
with $\Gamma$=1.9. This could in principle suggest that some of the highly
obscured AGN, required by most X-ray background synthesis models, may be

  However, the combined 0.5-8 keV \asca-\rosat spectrum is well fit by a
power-law of $\Gamma=1.7\pm0.2$ with a spectral upturn at soft energies.

uncertainties in the calibration of the ROSAT or ASCA detectors. Nevertheless
if real, it could imply that the above absorption model suggested by the \asca

supernovae show the following characteristics: 1) Complete Si-burning takes
place in more extended region, so that the mass ratio between the complete and
incomplete Si burning regions is generally larger in hypernovae than normal
supernovae. As a result, higher energy explosions tend to produce larger [(Zn,
Co)/Fe], small [(Mn, Cr)/Fe], and larger [Fe/O], which could explain the trend
observed in very metal-poor stars. 2) Si-burning takes place in lower density
regions, so that the effects of $\alpha$-rich freezeout is enhanced. Thus
$^{44}$Ca, $^{48}$Ti, and $^{64}$Zn are produced more abundantly than in normal
supernovae. The large [(Ti, Zn)/Fe] ratios observed in very metal poor stars
strongly suggest a significant contribution of hypernovae. 3) Oxygen burning

a larger amount of Si, S, Ar, and Ca (""Si"") are synthesized, which makes the

planar defects and the magnetic field. The scaling is valid only for angles
where the transition temperature $T_{BG} (\theta)$ shows a cusp. The critical
exponents $sx$ and $sy$ are in agreement with the values predicted by Lidmar

inversion - a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a strongly charged particle,
called macroion, binds so many counterions that its net charge changes sign. We
discuss the universal theory of charge inversion based on the idea of a
strongly correlated liquid of adsorbed counterions, similar to a Wigner
crystal. This theory has a vast array of applications, particularly in biology
and chemistry; for example, the DNA double helix in the presence of positive
multivalent ions (e.g., polycations) acquires a net positive charge and drifts
as a positive particle in electric field. This simplifies DNA uptake by the
cell as needed for gene therapy, because the cell membrane is negatively
charged. We discuss also the analogies of charge inversion in other fields of
physics.

using syntactic structure for language modeling. A lexicalized probabilistic
top-down parser is then presented, which performs very well, in terms of both
the accuracy of returned parses and the efficiency with which they are found,
relative to the best broad-coverage statistical parsers. A new language model
which utilizes probabilistic top-down parsing is then outlined, and empirical
results show that it improves upon previous work in test corpus perplexity.
Interpolation with a trigram model yields an exceptional improvement relative
to the improvement observed by other models, demonstrating the degree to which
the information captured by our parsing model is orthogonal to that captured by
a trigram model. A small recognition experiment also demonstrates the utility
of the model.

upper bound on the baryonic matter than that required by the standard model. A
variable gravitational and cosmological constant were then introduced in a
scenario which conserves the energy and momentum in the presence of bulk
viscosity. The result of the analysis reveals that various models could be

asymptotically into a singular viscous one. The considered models solve for
many of the standard model problems. Though the introduction of bulk viscosity
results in the creation of particles, this scenario conserves energy and
momentum. As in the standard model the entropy remains constant. We have not

neutrinos. Though the role of viscosity today is minute it could, nevertheless,

define Schur functions, Hall-Littlewood functions associated to G(e,p,n), and
show that our Green functions are obtained as a transition matrix between those
two kinds of symmetric functions. As a special case, it gives a combinatorial
treatmnet of Green functions of type D_n.

coupling individually to different environments (`independent decoherence') and
qubits interacting collectively with the same reservoir (`collective
decoherence'). In both cases, explicit decoherence functions are derived for
any number of qubits. The decay of the coherences of the register is shown to
strongly depend on the input states: we show that this sensitivity is a
characteristic of $both$ types of coupling (collective and independent) and not

A","quant-ph cond-mat hep-th math-ph math.MP",,"  I show that the potential $$V(x,m) = \big [\frac{b^2}{4}-m(1-m)a(a+1) \big
]\frac{\sn^2 (x,m)}{\dn^2 (x,m)} -b(a+{1/2}) \frac{\cn (x,m)}{\dn^2 (x,m)}$$
constitutes a QES band-structure problem in one dimension. In particular, I
show that for any positive integral or half-integral $a$, $2a+1$ band edge
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be obtained analytically. In the limit of m
going to 0 or 1, I recover the well known results for the QES double
sine-Gordon or double sinh-Gordon equations respectively. As a by product, I
also obtain the boundstate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the potential
$$V(x) = \big [\frac{\beta^2}{4}-a(a+1) \big ] \sech^2 x +\beta(a+{1/2})\sech
x\tanh x$$ in case $a$ is any positive integer or half-integer.
