present analysis we use the new data coming from MAXIMA and BOOMERanG balloon
borne experiments, the first results of the DASI interferometer together with
the COBE/DMR data. The quality of these independent data sets implies that the
$C_\ell$ are rather well known, and allow reliable constraints. We found that
the constraints in the $\Omega-H_0$ plane are very tightened, favouring a flat
Universe, that the index of the primordial fluctuations is very close to one,
that the primordial baryon density is now in good agreement with primordial
nucleosynthesis. Nevertheless degeneracies between several parameters still
exist, and for instance the constraint on the cosmological constant or the
Hubble constant are very weak, preferred values being low. A way to break these
degeneracies is to ``cross-constrain'' the parameters by combining with
constraints from other independent data. We use the baryon fraction
determination from X-ray clusters of galaxies as an additional constraint and
show that the combined analysis leads to strong constraints on all cosmological
parameters. Using a high baryon fraction ($\sim 15%$ for $h = 0.5$) we found a
rather low Hubble constant, values around 80 km/s/Mpc being ruled out. Using a
recent and low baryon fraction estimation ($\sim 10%$ for $h = 0.5$) we found a
preferred model with a low Hubble constant and a high density content

  Observable consequence of the m=0 mode excitation is a small period change

  Significant amplitude and phase modulation is predicted in the case of
excitation of a m=1,-1 pair. We suggest that this may explain Blazhko-type

properties, only about 10 per cent of all PNe are spherical. By comparing the

of slightly more metal-rich ([Fe/H]~-1.3 dex), young (age 150-500 Myr) stars. A
discontinuity in the I-band luminosity function is detected at I_0 = 23.44 \pm
0.09 mag. Interpreting this feature as the tip of the red giant branch and
adopting M_I=-4.20\pm 0.10 mag for its absolute magnitude, we have determined a
Population II distance modulus of (m - M)_0=27.64 \pm 0.14 mag (3.4 \pm 0.2
Mpc). This distance confirms ESO 540-032 as a member of the nearby Sculptor
group but is significantly larger than a previously reported value based on the

population synthesis models suggest that the application of the SBF technique

underlying stellar composition and thus offers no advantage over a direct
distance measurement using the tip of the red giant branch as distance
indicator. We produce the surface brightness profiles for ESO 540-032 and
derive the photometric and structural parameters. The global properties follow
closely the relations between metallicity and both absolute magnitude and

probably from the diffuse cold atomic medium. In more active galaxies,
considered globally, the average [CII] line emission is dominated by dense

at infrared/optical energies (i.e., of the LBL type) display a relatively flat
(alpha_x ~ 0.9) X-ray spectrum, which we interpret as inverse Compton emission.
Four objects (2/3 of the LBL) show some evidence for a low-energy steepening
which is likely due to the synchrotron tail merging into the inverse Compton
component around ~ 1 - 3 keV. If this were generally the case with LBL, it
would explain why the 0.1 - 2.4 keV ROSAT spectra of our sources are

stablish the conditions -- proposition 1 -- for the conservation of the Noether

  4-10,2001",,,,"hep-ph",,"  A brief review is given of $a_{\mu}=(g_{\mu}-2)/2$ as a probe of
supersymmetry and of extra dimensions. It is known since the early to mid
nineteen eightees that the supersymmetric electro-weak correction to $a_{\mu}$
can be as large or larger than the Standard Model electro-weak correction and
thus any experiment that proposes to test the Standard Model electro-weak
correction will also test the supersymmetric correction and constrain
supersymmetric models. The new physics effect seen in the Brookhaven (BNL)
experiment is consistent with these early expectations. Detailed analyses
within the well motivated supergravity unified model show that the size of the
observed difference ($a_{\mu}^{exp}-a_{\mu}^{SM}$) seen at Brookhaven implies
upper limits on sparticle masses in a mass range accessible to the direct
observation of these particles at the Large Hadron Collider. Further, analyses
also show that the BNL data is favorable for the detection of supersymmeteric
dark matter in direct dark matter searches. The effect of large extra
dimensions on $a_{\mu}$ is also discussed. It is shown that with the current
limits on the size of extra dimensions, which imply that the inverse size of
such dimensions lies in the TeV region, their effects on $a_{\mu}$ relative to
the supersymmetric contribution is small and thus extra dimensions do not
produce a serious background to the supersymmetric contribution. It is
concluded that the analysis of the additional data currently underway at
Brookhaven as well as a reduction of the hadronic error will help pin down the
scale of weak scale supersymmetry even more precisely.

superspace. We perform a thorough (if not complete) analysis of the superforms
starting from 0-form and moving all the way up to 6-form. Like the N=1 case we
find that the lower superforms (0,1,2,3) describe the various important N=2
supermultiplets. Also, the forms form chains, the field strength of 0-form
being related to the gauge form of the 1-form, and so on. However, an important
difference with the N=1 case is that there is now more than one chain.
  Our main aim was to study the higher-forms (4,5,6) to obtain the various N=2
action formulas via the ectoplasmic approach. Indeed, we reproduce the three
known action formulas involving a volume integral, a contour integral and no
integral over the harmonic subspace from the 6, 5 and 4-form analysis
respectively. The next aim is to generalize the analysis to curved space-time
(supergravity).

attractors (SNAs). Such attractors are generic in quasiperiodically driven
nonlinear systems, and like strange attractors, are geometrically fractal. The
largest Lyapunov exponent is zero or negative: trajectories do not show
exponential sensitivity to initial conditions. In recent years, SNAs have been
seen in a number of diverse experimental situations ranging from
quasiperiodically driven mechanical or electronic systems to plasma discharges.
An important connection is the equivalence between a quasiperiodically driven
system and the Schr\""odinger equation for a particle in a related quasiperiodic
potential, giving a correspondence between the localized states of the quantum
problem with SNAs in the related dynamical system. In this review we discuss
the main conceptual issues in the study of SNAs, including the different
bifurcations or routes for the creation of such attractors, the methods of
characterization, and the nature of dynamical transitions in quasiperiodically
forced systems. The variation of the Lyapunov exponent, and the qualitative and
quantitative aspects of its local fluctuation properties, has emerged as an
important means of studying fractal attractors, and this analysis finds useful
application here. The ubiquity of such attractors, in conjunction with their
several unusual properties, suggest novel applications.

entropy S of the universe tends toward a maximum (the second law law of
information theory). For a perfect symmetric static structure, the information
is zero and the static entropy is the maximum (the third law law of information
theory). Based on the Gibbs inequality and the second law of the revised
information theory we have proved the similarity principle (a continuous higher
similarity-higher entropy relation after the rejection of the Gibbs paradox)
and proved the Curie-Rosen symmetry principle (a higher symmetry-higher
stability relation) as a special case of the similarity principle. Some
examples in chemical physics have been given. Spontaneous processes of all
kinds of molecular interaction, phase separation and phase transition,
including symmetry breaking and the densest molecular packing and
crystallization, are all driven by information minimization or symmetry
maximization. The evolution of the universe in general and evolution of life in
particular can be quantitatively considered as a series of symmetry breaking
processes. The two empirical rules - similarity rule and complementarity rule -
have been given a theoretical foundation. All kinds of periodicity in space and
time are symmetries and contribute to the stability. Symmetry is beautiful
because it renders stability. However, symmetry is in principle ugly because it
is associated with information loss.

"quant-ph/0105032","Daniel Gottesman","Daniel Gottesman, Isaac Chuang","Quantum Digital Signatures","8 pages. v2 is substantially expanded, with additional details and
  explanation",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We present a quantum digital signature scheme whose security is based on
fundamental principles of quantum physics. It allows a sender (Alice) to sign a
message in such a way that the signature can be validated by a number of
different people, and all will agree either that the message came from Alice or
that it has been tampered with. To accomplish this task, each recipient of the
message must have a copy of Alice's ""public key,"" which is a set of quantum
states whose exact identity is known only to Alice. Quantum public keys are
more difficult to deal with than classical public keys: for instance, only a
limited number of copies can be in circulation, or the scheme becomes insecure.
However, in exchange for this price, we achieve unconditionally secure digital
signatures. Sending an m-bit message uses up O(m) quantum bits for each
recipient of the public key. We briefly discuss how to securely distribute
quantum public keys, and show the signature scheme is absolutely secure using
one method of key distribution. The protocol provides a model for importing the
ideas of classical public key cryptography into the quantum world.

  Aharonov-Bohm time operator","17 pages, REVTeX style file. Some relevant references are added in
  Sec. 2",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The wave functions, the autocorrelation functions of which decay faster than
$t^{-2}$, for both the one-dimensional free particle system and the
repulsive-potential system are examined. It is then shown that such wave
functions constitute a dense subset of $L^2 ({\bf R}^1)$, under several
conditions that are particularly satisfied by the square barrier potential
system. It implies that the faster than $t^{-2}$-decay character of the
autocorrelation function persists against the perturbation of potential. It is
also seen that the denseness of the above subset is guaranteed by that of the
domain of the Aharonov-Bohm time operator.

iterated formulas and the simpler approximate formulas and the precise formula
for the amplitude in the desired state. A mathematical proof of Grover's
algorithm being optimal among the algorithms with arbitrary phase rotations was
given in this paper. This first reported the non-symmetric effects of different
rotating angles, and gave the first-order approximate phase condition when
rotating angles are different.

Although these POVMs are optimal they are not always minimal, indicating that
there is room for improvement.
