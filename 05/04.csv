spectrum shows excess power at $\ell \sim 860$ over the average level of power
at $411 \le\ell \le 785.$ This excess is statistically significant on the 95%
confidence level. Such a feature is consistent with the presence of a third
acoustic peak, which is a generic prediction of inflation-based models. The
height and the position of the excess power match the predictions of a family
of inflationary models with cosmological parameters that are fixed to fit the
CMB data previously provided by BOOMERANG-LDB and MAXIMA-1 experiments (e.g.,
Jaffe et al.2001). Our results, therefore, lend support for inflationary models
and more generally for the dominance of coherent perturbations in the structure
formation of the Universe. At the same time, they seem to disfavor a large
variety of the non-standard (but still inflation-based) models that have been
proposed to improve the quality of fits to the CMB data and consistency with
other cosmological observables.
  Within standard inflationary models, our results combined with the COBE-DMR

four-point correlation function in large scale pressure fluctuations. Using the
full covariance matrix of the SZ thermal power spectrum, we study astrophysical
uses of the SZ effect and discuss the extent to which gas properties can be
derived from a measurement of the SZ power spectrum. With the SZ thermal effect
separated in temperature fluctuations using its frequency information, the
kinetic SZ effect is expected to dominate the CMB temperature fluctuations at
small angular scales. The presence of the SZ kinetic effect can be determined
through a cross-correlation between the SZ thermal and a CMB map at small
scales. We suggest a statistic that can be used to study the correlation
between pressure traced by the SZ thermal effect and the baryons traced by the
SZ kinetic effect involving the cross-power spectrum constructed through
squared temperatures instead of the usual temperature itself. Through a
signal-to-noise calculation, we show that future small angular scale
multi-frequency CMB experiments, sensitive to multipoles of a few thousand,
will be able to measure the cross-correlation of SZ thermal and SZ kinetic

z ~ 3 is enriched to ~0.1-1% solar metallicity and that the hot gas in large
clusters of galaxies (ICM) is enriched to 1/3-1/2 solar metallicity at z=0.
Metals in the IGM may have been removed from galaxies (in which they presumably
form) during dynamical encounters between galaxies, by ram-pressure stripping,
by supernova-driven winds, or as radiation-pressure driven dust efflux. This
study develops a method of investigating the chemical enrichment of the IGM and
of galaxies, using already completed cosmological simulations. To these
simulations, we add dust and (gaseous) metals, distributing the dust and metals
in the gas according to three simple parameterized prescriptions, one for each
enrichment mechanism. These prescriptions are formulated to capture the basic
ejection physics, and calibrated when possible with empirical data. Our results
indicate that dynamical removal of metals from >~ 3*10^8 solar mass galaxies
cannot account for the observed metallicity of low-column density Ly-alpha
absorbers, and that dynamical removal from >~ 3*10^10 solar mass galaxies
cannot account for the ICM metallicities. Dynamical removal also fails to
produce a strong enough mass-metallicity relation in galaxies. In contrast,
either wind or radiation-pressure ejection of metals from relatively large
galaxies can plausibly account for all three sets of observations (though it is
unclear whether metals can be distributed uniformly enough in the low-density
regions without overly disturbing the IGM, and whether clusters can be enriched
quite as much as observed). We investigate in detail how our results change
with variations in our assumed parameters, and how results for the different
ejection processes compare. (Abridged)

minimize the appearance of differences in their nuclear properties. The soft

rate, which corresponds also to time of the maximum enrichment, is not unique
but is a strong function of the adopted stellar lifetimes, initial mass
function and star formation rate. This timescale varies from $\sim 40-50$ Myr
for an instantaneous starburst to $\sim$ 0.3 Gyr for a typical elliptical
galaxy to $\sim 4.0-5.0$ Gyr for a disk of a spiral Galaxy like the Milky Way.
We also show that the typical timescale of 1 Gyr, often quoted as the typical
timescale for the type Ia supernovae, is just the time at which, in the solar
neighbourhood, the Fe production from supernovae Ia starts to become important
and not the time at which SNe Ia start to explode. As a cosequence of this, a
change in slope in the [O/Fe] ratio is expected in correspondance of this
timescale. We conclude that the suggested lack of supernovae Ia at low
metallicities produces results at variance with the observed [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]
relation in the solar region. We also compute the supernova Ia rates for
different galaxies as a function of redshift and predict an extended maximum
between redshift $z \sim 3.6$ and $z \sim 1.6$ for elliptical galaxies, and two
maxima, one at $z \sim 3$ and the other at $z \sim 1$, for spiral galaxies,

approach in which we start with a singlet pair wavefunction or a 'geminal' from
which the many body wavefunction is then constructed by taking an
antisymmetrized geminal product (AGP). A relatively simple practical
implementation of the AGP method is developed where the one-particle orbitals
are approximated by the Kohn-Sham solutions used in standard band computations,
and the orbital-dependent BCS energy scale $\Delta_i$ is determined through a
readily computed exchange-type integral. The methodology is illustrated by
considering EMD and Compton profiles in Li, Be and Al. It is found that in Li
the present scheme predicts a substantial renormalization of the LDA result for
the EMD; in Be, the computed correlation effect is anisotropic, while in Al,
the deviations from the LDA are relatively small. These theoretical predictions
are in qualitative accord with the corresponding experimental observations on
Li, Be and Al, and indicate the potential of the AGP method for describing
correlation effects on the EMD in wide classes of materials.

Analytical methods and sophisticated `dislocation-dynamics' simulations have
proved very effective in the study of dislocation patterning, and have led to
macroscopic constitutive laws of plastic deformation. Yet, a statistical
analysis of the dynamics of an assembly of interacting dislocations has not
hitherto been performed. Here we report acoustic emission measurements on
stressed ice single crystals, the results of which indicate that dislocations
move in a scale-free intermittent fashion. This result is confirmed by
numerical simulations of a model of interacting dislocations that successfully
reproduces the main features of the experiment. We find that dislocations
generate a slowly evolving configuration landscape which coexists with rapid
collective rearrangements. These rearrangements involve a comparatively small
fraction of the dislocations and lead to an intermittent behavior of the net
plastic response. This basic dynamical picture appears to be a generic feature
in the deformation of many other materials. Moreover, it should provide a
framework for discussing fundamental aspects of plasticity, that goes beyond
standard mean-field approaches that see plastic deformation as a smooth laminar

complexes resembling the chromatin 10 nm fiber. At small enough concentration
of spheres these ""artificial chromatin"" complexes are negative, while at large
enough concentrations of spheres the charge of DNA is inverted by the adsorbed
spheres. Charges of complexes stabilize their solutions. In the plane of
concentrations of DNA and spheres the phases with positive and negative
complexes are separated by another phase, which contains the condensate of
neutral DNA-spheres complexes. Thus when the concentration of spheres grows,
DNA-spheres complexes experience condensation and resolubilization (or
reentrant condensation). Phenomenological theory of the phase diagram of
reentrant condensation and charge inversion is suggested. Parameters of this
theory are calculated by microscopic theory. It is shown that an important part
of the effect of a monovalent salt on the phase diagram can be described by the
nontrivial renormalization of the effective linear charge density of DNA wound
around a sphere, due to the Onsager-Manning condensation. We argue that our

another monoclinic (MC) phase with increasing field strength. Since the latter
phase change is very unusual, its transition sequence has been investigated by
using triple-axis neutron scattering techniques so that the ``skin effect''
observed by x-ray scattering can be avoided, and the entire crystal bulk is
probed. Contour maps of the elastic scattering have been mapped out in each
phase in the (HOL) zone with high q-resolution. Increasing the field strength

spectra shows two lines characteristic of two different magnetic phases. From

ferromagnetic-metallic (FMM) clusters in this temperature interval, is mainly
paramagnetic and not antiferromagnetic. The FMM/ICO ratio can be tuned with a
relatively small field, which suggests that the internal energy associated with
those phases is very similar. Below TN, there is an appreciable FM contribution
to the magnetization and the ESR spectra indicates the presence of FM clusters
in an antiferromagnetic matrix (canted). Our results show that ESR could be a
very useful tool to investigate the nature of the phase-separated state now

place limits to the range of its validity. The corrections obtained will change

analysis, is no longer valid, and a non-extensive correction appears. This
correction is computed and its influence is studied and compared with previous
works, where, even when the universe was considered as an slightly
non-extensive system, the PDB was assumed valid. We analytically track the
formation of Helium and Deuterium, and study the kind of deviation one could
expect from the standard regime. The correction to the capture time, the moment
in which Deuterium can no longer be substantially photo-disintegrated, is also
presented. This allows us to take into account the process of the free decay of
neutrons, which was absent in all previous treatments of the topic. We show
that even when considering a first (linear) order correction in the quantum
distribution functions, the final output on the primordial nucleosynthesis
yields cannot be reduced to a linear correction in the abundances. We finally
obtain new bounds upon the non-extensive parameter, both comparing the range of

be calculated without having to introduce vertices in the Feynman rules for
redundant operators. These effective beta-functions suffice to apply the
renormalization group equation to any transition amplitude (i.e., S- matrix

and so does the MSSM in the decoupling limit. The MSSM gives a slightly better
fit to the data than the SM (\Delta \chi^2_{min} \sim -2) when relatively light
left-handed sleptons of mass \sim 200 GeV and a light chargino of mixed
higgsino-wino character (\mu/M_2 \sim 1) with mass \sim 100 GeV co-exist. The
improvement in the fit diminishes quickly for wino- or higgsino- dominant
charginos, for heavier charginos, and for lighter sleptons. We find that the
MSSM contributions to the muon g-2 is most efficient when the light chargino
has a mixed character. If \tan\beta < 10, the set of a light mixed chargino and
light sleptons that is favored by the electroweak data is also favored by the
g-2 data for \mu >0. Models with light gauginos (\mu/M_2 > 10) or light

Kontsevich integral of a knot. Roughly speaking, this rational presentation of
the Kontsevich integral would sum formal power series into rational functions
with prescribed denominators. Rozansky's conjecture was soon proven by the
second author. We begin our paper by reviewing Rozansky's conjecture and the
main ideas that lead to its proof. The natural question of extending this
conjecture to links leads to the class of boundary links, and a proof of
Rozansky's conjecture in this case. A subtle issue is the fact that a `hair'
map which replaces beads by the exponential of hair is not 1-1. This raises the
question of whether a rational invariant of boundary links exists in an
appropriate space of trivalent graphs whose edges are decorated by rational
functions in noncommuting variables. A main result of the paper is to construct
such an invariant, using the so-called surgery view of boundary links and after
developing a formal diagrammatic Gaussian integration.
  Since our invariant is one of many rational forms of the Kontsevich integral,
one may ask if our invariant is in some sense canonical. We prove that this is
indeed the case, by axiomatically characterizing our invariant as a universal
finite type invariant of boundary links with respect to the null move. Finally,
we discuss relations between our rational invariant and homology surgery, and
give some applications to low dimensional topology.

for the pair (M,X) a complexity c(M,X) and show that, when M is closed,
irreducible and P^2-irreducible, $c(M,\emptyset)$ is the minimal number of
tetrahedra in a triangulation of M. Moreover c is additive under connected sum,
and, given any n>=0, there are only finitely many irreducible and
P^2-irreducible closed manifolds having complexity up to n. We prove that every
irreducible and P^2-irreducible pair (M,X) has a finite splitting along tori
and Klein bottles into pairs having the same properties, and complexity is
additive on this splitting. As opposed to the JSJ decomposition, our splitting
is not canonical, but it involves much easier blocks than all Seifert and
simple manifolds. In particular, most Seifert and hyperbolic manifolds appear
to have non-trivial splitting. In addition, a given set of blocks can be
combined to give only a finite number of pairs (M,X). Our splitting theorem
provides the theoretical background for an algorithm which classifies
3-manifolds of any given complexity. This algorithm has been already
implemented and proved effective in the orientable case for complexity up to 9.

  dilation, light deflection by the sun, and Mercury's precession all to within
  1% error. Section III.D revised",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  A simple general relativity theory for objects moving in gravitational fields
is developed based on studying the behavior of an atom in a gravitational
field. The theory is applied to calculate the satellite time dilation, light
deflection by the sun, and Mercury's precession with an error of less than 1%.
The approach to the new theory introduced here is radically different from the
geometric approach used by Einstein's general relativity. The theory is field
based where the potential energy of a system of masses can be easily calculated
and the force can be found as the gradient of the potential field in analogy to
the Newtonian mechanics. The resulting field equations become the traditional
Newton's equations when week gravitational effects are present. The theory
complies with all the known experimental results such as the gravitational time
dilation and faster light speeds higher in the gravitational field. The special
relativity theory of an object moving without experiencing gravitational fields
can be derived directly from the gravitational field equations introduced here.
The theory introduced here has crucial differences to Einstein's general
relativity theory. For example, the gravitational field cannot accelerate an
object to higher than the speed of light and the event horizon of a black hole
(where light cannot escape) has to be of zero radius, essentially meaning that
light can escape any object unless the object has infinite density. Another
primary consequence of this study is that the principle of equivalence of
gravitational and inertial mass has only limited validity and a new definition
of gravitational mass is given here.
