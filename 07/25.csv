steady-state accretion disk model spectra with $\dot{m} \simeq$ 7e-09 M_sun/yr.
The spectra also show numerous absorption lines of H I, He II, and two- to
five-times ionized transitions of C, N, O, P, S and Si. There are no emission
features in the spectra, with the possible exception of a weak feature on the
red wing of the O VI doublet. The absorption lines are narrow (FWHM ~ 500
km/s), too narrow to arise from the disk photosphere, and at low velocities (<=
700 km/s). The S VI and O VI doublets are optically thick. The absorption lines
in the plateau spectra show orbital variability: in spectra obtained at orbital
phases 0.53 -- 0.79, low-ionization absorption lines appear and the central
depths of the pre-existing lines increase. The increase in line absorption
occurs at the same orbital phases as previously observed EUV and X-ray light
curve dips. If the absorbing material is in (near-) Keplerian rotation around
the disk, it must be located at large disk radii. The final observation
occurred when U Gem was about two magnitudes from optical quiescence. The
spectra are dominated by emission from an $\simeq$43,000 K, metal-enriched
white dwarf (WD). The inferred radius of the WD is 4.95e+08 cm, close to that

in composition that is consistent with observed Type Ia supernova flux spectra.
Synthetic spectra generated without purely spherical composition symmetry
indicate that gross asymmetries make prominent changes to absorption features.
Motivated by this, we consider the case of a single unblended line forming in
an atmosphere with perturbations of different scales and spatial distributions.
Perturbations of about 1% of the area of the photodisk simply weaken the
absorption feature by the same amount independent of the line of sight.
Conversely, perturbations of about 10% of the area of the photodisk introduce
variation in the absorption depth which does depend on the line of sight. Thus,
1% photodisk area perturbations may be consistent with observed profile
homogeneity but 10% photodisk area perturbations can not. Based on this, we
suggest that the absence of significant variation in the depths of Si II 6355
absorption features in normal Type Ia spectra near maximum light indicates that
any composition perturbations in these events are quite small. This also
constrains future three-dimensional explosion models to produce ejecta profiles
with only small scale inhomogeneities.

dominated by the strong pulsation at the rotational period of the white dwarf
(312.8s) with no sign of orbital or sideband periodicity, thus confirming
previous ROSAT results. However, we detect changes in the power spectra between
the two epochs. While the second harmonic of the spin period is present during
both observations, the first harmonic is absent in 1997. An increase in the
amplitude of the spin pulsation is found between 1997 and 1998 together with a
decrease in the X-ray flux. The average X-ray spectrum from 0.1 to 100keV is
well described by an isothermal plasma at ~27keV plus complex absorption and an
iron K(alpha) fluorescent line, due to reflection from the white dwarf surface.
The rotational pulsation is compatible with complex absorption dominating the
low energy range, while the high energy spin modulation can be attributed to
tall shocks above the accreting poles. The RXTE spectrum in 1997 also shows the
presence of an absorption edge from ionized iron likely located in the
pre-shock accretion flow. The variations along the spin period of the partial
covering absorber and of reflection are compatible with the classical accretion
curtain scenario. The variations in the spin pulse characteristics and X-ray
flux indicate that V709 Cas experiences changes in the mass accretion rate on
timescales from months to years.

random field Ising magnet is studied numerically, aided by scaling analyses. In
the ferromagnetic phase the scaling of the roughness of the domain walls,
$w\sim L^\zeta$, is consistent with the theoretical prediction $\zeta = 2/3$.
As the randomness is increased through the transition, the probability
distribution of the interfacial tension of domain walls scales as for a single
second order transition. At the critical point, the fractal dimensions of
domain walls and the fractal dimension of the outer surface of spin clusters
are investigated: there are at least two distinct physically important fractal
dimensions. These dimensions are argued to be related to combinations of the
energy scaling exponent, $\theta$, which determines the violation of
hyperscaling, the correlation length exponent $\nu$, and the magnetization
exponent $\beta$. The value $\beta = 0.017\pm 0.005$ is derived from the
magnetization: this estimate is supported by the study of the spin cluster size
distribution at criticality. The variation of configurations in the interior of
a sample with boundary conditions is consistent with the hypothesis that there
is a single transition separating the disordered phase with one ground state
from the ordered phase with two ground states. The array of results are shown
to be consistent with a scaling picture and a geometric description of the
influence of boundary conditions on the spins. The details of the algorithm

long range order enables us to build an effective medium description which
incorporates the radial fluctuations of the contact forces acting on a single

a highly non-linear differential equation for the ""equation of state"" linking
the effective stiffness of the array with the applied pressure, from which
sound velocities are then obtained. The results are in excellent agreement with
existing experimental results and simulations in the high and intermediate
pressure regimes. It emerges from the analysis that the departure of $v_{L}(P)$

fluctuations of the stress field, rather than to the pressure dependence of the

a smooth deformation of the 3-brane class of solutions. The solution is

that for large values of the radius the deformation is small and it
asymptotically approaches the undeformed 3-brane solution, signaling a
restoration of conformal invariance in the UV for the dual gauge theory. We
suggest that the supergravity deformation corresponds to a massive deformation
on the dual gauge theory and consequently the deformed theory has the
undeformed one as an ultraviolet fixed point. In cases where the original
3-brane solution preserves some amount of supersymmetry we suggest that the
gauge theory interpretation is that of soft supersymmetry breaking. We discuss
the deformation for D3-branes on the conifold and the generalized conifold

transition in SMM is studied as a function of the remnant mass and charge using
the microcanonical equation of state. For light remnants $A \leq $ 100,
backbending is observed indicating negative specific heat, while for $A \geq$
170 the effective latentheat approaches zero. Thus for heavier systems this

incomplete fusion. Excitation energies of both cold and hot fragment are

the suggested model provides a good description of the experimental data with

The overall relativistic effect increases with the energy. The width of the

at 1314 nm wavelength are created by spontaneous parametric down-conversion and
coupled into standard telecom fibers. Our PPLN waveguide features a very high
conversion efficiency of about 10^(-6), roughly 4 orders of magnitude more than
that obtained employing bulk crystals. Even if using low power laser diodes,
this engenders a significant probability for creating two pairs at a time - an
important advantage for some quantum communication protocols. We point out a
simple means to characterize the pair creation probability in case of a pulsed
pump. To investigate the quality of the entangled states, we perform
photon-pair interference experiments, leading to visibilities of 97% for the
case of energy-time entanglement and of 84% for the case of time-bin
entanglement. Although the last figure must still be improved, these tests
demonstrate the high potential of PPLN waveguide based sources to become a key
element for future quantum communication schemes
