that the interaction of density structures in the ejecta with the reverse

been observed. We discuss the use of high-resolution radio images of supernovae
to distinguish between different absorption mechanisms and determine the origin
of specific light curve features. Comparisons of VLBI images of SN1993J with
synthetic model images suggest that internal free-free absorption completely
obscures emission at 8.4 GHz passing through the center of the supernova for
the first few tens of years after explosion. We predict that at 8.4 GHz the
internal free-free absorption is currently declining, and that over the next 40
years the surface brightness of the center of the source should increase
relative to the bright ring of emission seen in VLBI images. Similar absorption
in a nearby supernova would make the detection of a radio pulsar at 1 GHz

hydrodynamics, adaptive mesh 'Hydra' code (SPH-A$P^3$M), with model galaxies
consisting of dark halo, and gas and stellar disc components. The simulations
also include radiative cooling, which is important for keeping the warm,
diffuse gas of moderate density from being unrealistically heated by the ICM.
We examine the role that wind velocity, density and galaxy tilt play in gas
stripping.
  The onset of the ICM wind has a profound effect on the disc gas that is not
immediately stripped. This remnant disc is displaced relative to the halo
center and compressed. This can trigger gravitational instability and the
formation of numerous flocculent spirals. These waves transport angular
momentum outward, resulting in further compression of the inner disc and the
formation of a prominent gas ring. This 'annealing' process makes the inner
disc, which contains much of the total gas mass, resistant to further
stripping, but presumably susceptible to global starbursts.
  When the mass loss and annealing processes go to completion we find that the
total amount of mass lost from a fixed target galaxy is well fit by a simple
power-law function of a dimensionless parameter that combines the ram pressure
and internal properties of the galaxy. (abs. abbreviated)

order 10^{-33} eV, allowing them to play the role of the light scalar of
quintessence models. The radion-as-quintessence solves a long-standing problem
since its small mass is technically natural, in that it is stable against
radiative corrections. Its challenges are to explain why such a light particle
has not been seen in precision tests of gravity, and why Newton's constant has
not appreciably evolved since nucleosynthesis. We find the couplings suggested

relativistic energies. High-energy photons can originate from decay of neutral
pions produced by the interaction of these protons with the medium surrounding
the source. In the same hadronic chain, high energy neutrinos are expected to
be produced from decay of charged pions, as well as from decay of generated
muons. Neutrinos can travel cosmological distances being much less absorbed
than photons, thus providing a powerful tool for the investigation of cosmic
sources. In the frame of a recently proposed hadronic model for the emission of
high-energy gamma-rays, we estimate the neutrino emission from GRBs and
calculate the neutrino fluxes at Earth as a function of the model parameters.
The detectability of the expected signal by current and future experiments is

areas is studied. The neuronal network is composed of many Hebbian
autoassociators, or modules, each of which interacts with a relatively small
number of the others. Every module encodes and stores a number of elementary
percepts, or features. Memory items, or patterns, are peculiar combinations of
features sparsely distributed over the multi-modular network. Any feature
stored in any module can be involved in several of the stored patterns;
feature-sharing is in fact source of local ambiguities and, consequently, a
potential cause of erroneous memory retrieval activity spreading through the
model network.
  The memory retrieval dynamics of the large multi-modular autoassociator is
investigated by means of quantitative analysis and numerical simulations. An
oscillatory retrieval process is found to be very efficient in overcoming
feature-sharing drawbacks; it requires a mechanism that modulates the
robustness of local attractors to noise, and neuronal activity sparseness such
that quiescent and active modules are about equally noisy. Correlated
activation of interconnected modules and extramodular neuronal contacts more
effective than the intramodular ones seem to be general requirements in order
to efficiently achieve satisfactory quality of memory retrieval. It is also
shown that, even in ideal conditions, some spots of the network cannot be
reached by retrieval activity spread. The locations of these activity isles
depend on the pattern to retrieve and on the cue, while their extension only
depends on architecture of the graph and statistics of the stored patterns. The
existence of these isles determines an upper-bound to retrieval quality that
does not depend on the specific retrieval dynamics adopted, nor on whether
feature-sharing is permitted. The oscillatory retrieval process nearly
saturates this bound.

as the heavier Higgs particles, are light enough to be produced at the next
generation of $\ee$ linear colliders with center of mass energy around
$\sqrt{s} \sim 800$ GeV, with sizeable cross sections. An important part of
this parameter space remains even when we require that the density of the
lightest neutralinos left over from the Big Bang, which we calculate using
standard assumptions, falls in the range favored by current determinations of
the Dark Matter density in the Universe. Already at a c.m. energy of 500 GeV,
SUSY particles can be accessible in some parameter range, and if the energy is
increased to $\sqrt{s} \simeq 1.2$ TeV, the $e^+e^-$ collider will have a reach

modifying the gravitino variation to include both Z_2-odd and Z_2-even

part in the gravitino variation leads to tilted branes. Choosing the flipped

of Finsler manifolds with constant positive flag curvature.
  <p> The first remark is that there is a canonical Kahler structure on the
space of geodesics of such a manifold.
  <p> The second remark is that there is a natural way to construct a (not
necessarily complete) Finsler n-manifold of constant positive flag curvature
out of a hypersurface in suitably general position in complex projective
n-space.
  <p> The third remark is that there is a description of the Finsler metrics of
constant curvature on the 2-sphere in terms of a Riemannian metric and 1-form
on the space of its geodesics. In particular, this allows one to use any
(Riemannian) Zoll metric of positive Gauss curvature on the 2-sphere to
construct a global Finsler metric of constant positive curvature on the
2-sphere.
  <p> The fourth remark concerns the generality of the space of (local) Finsler
metrics of constant positive flag curvature in dimension n+1>2 . It is shown
that such metrics depend on n(n+1) arbitrary functions of n+1 variables and
that such metrics naturally correspond to certain torsion-free S^1 x
GL(n,R)-structures on 2n-manifolds. As a by-product, it is found that these
groups do occur as the holonomy of torsion-free affine connections in dimension
2n, a hitherto unsuspected phenomenon.

field to large-scale magnetic field arising due to nonhelical interactions, and
(2) inverse energy flux of magnetic energy caused by helical interactions.

Web- age is the need for systems to evolve as user requirements change. A
crucial factor in the creation of adaptable systems dealing with changing

where implicit system aspects are reified to become explicit first-class
(meta-data) objects. These implicit system aspects are often fundamental
structures which are inaccessible and immutable, and their reification as
meta-data objects can serve as the basis for changes and extensions to the
system, making it self- describing. To address the evolvability issue, this
paper proposes a reflective architecture based on two orthogonal abstractions -
model abstraction and information abstraction. In this architecture the
modeling abstractions allow for the separation of the description meta-data
from the system aspects they represent so that they can be managed and
versioned independently, asynchronously and explicitly. A practical example of
this philosophy, the CRISTAL project, is used to demonstrate the use of
meta-data objects to handle system evolution.

negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose of the entangled state, and show
how it is related to the distance of a state to the set of positive partially
transposed states (PPT-states). We illustrate this by calculating the closest
biseparable state to the W-state, and give a simple and very general proof for
the fact that the set of W-type states is not of measure zero. Next we show
that all surfaces with states whose partial transposes have constant minimal
negative eigenvalue are similar to the boundary of PPT states. We illustrate
this with some examples on bipartite qubit states, where contours of constant
negativity are plotted on two-dimensional intersections of the complete state
space.
