stars. A two-fluid model is used to describe the matter, where one fluid is the
superfluid neutrons that are believed to exist in the inner crust and core of
mature neutron stars, while the other fluid is a charge neutral conglomerate of
the remaining constituents (crust nuclei, core superconducting protons,
electrons, etc). We include the entrainment effect, which is a non-dissipative
interaction between the two fluids whereby a momentum induced in one of the
fluids will cause part of the mass of the other fluid to be carried along. The
equations that describe rotational equilibria (i.e. axisymmetric and stationary
configurations) are approximated using the slow-rotation approximation; an
expansion in terms of the rotation rates of the two fluids where only terms up
to second-order are kept. Our formalism allows the neutrons to rotate at a rate
different from that of the charged constituents. For a particular equation of
state that is quadratic in the two mass-densities and relative velocities of
the fluids, we find an analytic solution to the slow-rotation equations. This
result provides an elegant generalisation to the two-fluid problem of the
standard expressions for the one-fluid polytrope ${\cal E} \propto \rho^2$. The
model equation of state includes entrainment and is general enough to allow for
realistic values for, say, mass and radius of the star. It also includes a term
that can be related to ``symmetry energy'' terms that appear in more realistic
equations of state. We use the analytic solution to explore how relative
rotation between the two fluids, the ``symmetry energy'' term, and entrainment
affect the neutron star's local distribution of particles, as well as global
quantities as the Kepler limit, ellipticity, and moments of inertia.

multiplets, we had to modify the transition f-values so that generally weak
transitions were stronger than their published values. The fine-structure
populations indicate that the median thermal pressure for our entire sample is
p/k=2240 cm^-3 K, or slightly higher for temperatures that differ appreciably
from 40 K. About 15% of the gas moving at peculiar velocities shows p/k > 10^4
cm^-3 K, and this fraction drops to 1.5% for quiescent gas. Often, there are
small amounts of gas at p/k > 10^5 cm^-3 K. These ubiquitous wisps of high
pressure material probably arise from small-scale density enhancements created
by converging flows in a turbulent medium. The C I excitations indicate a
barytropic index gamma_eff > 0.90 when the gas is compressed, which is larger
than the value 0.72 expected for material in thermal equilibrium. This
indicates that the regions have a dimension r < 0.01 pc which allows them to
compress very quickly and nearly adiabatically. Appendices of this paper
present evidence that STIS can indeed achieve R = 200,000, and that telluric

carry out precision astrometry in crowded fields. This capability is crucial,
for example, to accurately measure proper motions of bright stars in nearby
galaxies. From such measurements, one can obtain distance estimates, explore
the dynamics of these systems and measure the mass of the Milky Way itself. In
this paper we investigate errors introduced by confusion, i.e. the presence of
objects other than the targeted star in the SIM field of view (FOV). Using
existing HST images of fields in M31, the LMC and the Galaxy we simulate the
background within the SIM FOV and estimate the errors in the measured position
of the target star. Our simulations account for the error contribution from
photon statistics. We also study the effects of pointing imperfections when a
field is revisited which result in errors in the measured proper motion. We use
the simulations to explore the measurement accuracy of several SIM key programs
which will require crowded field astrometry. In M31, the error in the absolute
position of the targets could be significant for all but the brightest targets.
Our results also indicate that in the case of the brightest targets in M31, and
for all likely target magnitudes in the other cases, confusion-induced proper
motion errors are well within the SIM requirements. However, targets which vary
in flux between measurements can be susceptible to enhanced proper motion
errors. We also find that for an on-source integration time of one hour, photon
noise is larger than or of comparable magnitude to the confusion-induced
position error for bright targets and dominates over proper motion error in
most cases.

optically thick thermal bremsstrahlung emission arising in the HII region
surrounding hot stars. Energy requirements indicate a range of a several to

this corresponds to integrated stellar masses of 0.1--60,000 Msun. For roughly
half of the sources in our sample, there is no obvious optical counterpart,
giving further support for their deeply embedded nature. Their luminosities and
radio spectral energy distributions are consistent with HII regions having

  issue",,"10.1086/323216",,"astro-ph",,"  The calculation of the transmission power spectrum of QSO's Lyman alpha
absorption requires two parameters for the normalization: the continuum Fc and
mean transmission, i.e. average of e^{-tau}. Traditionally, the continuum is
obtained by a polynomial fitting truncating it at a lower order, and the mean
transmission is calculated over the entire wavelength range considered. The
flux F is then normalized by the average of Fc e^{-tau}. However, the
fluctuations in the transmitted flux are significantly correlated with the
local background flux on scales for which the field is intermittent. In this
paper, we develop a self-normalization algorithm of the transmission power
spectrum based on a multiresolution analysis. This self-normalized power
spectrum estimator needs neither a continuum fitting, nor pre-determining the
mean transmission. With simulated samples, we show that the self-normalization
algorithm can perfectly recover the transmission power spectrum from the flux
regardless of how the continuum varies with wavelength. We also show that the
self-normalized power spectrum is also properly normalized by the mean
transmission. Moreover, this power spectrum estimator is sensitive to the
non-linear behavior of the field. That is, the self-normalized power spectrum
estimator can distinguish between fields with or without the
fluctuation-background correlation. This cannot be accomplished by the power
spectrum with the normalization by an overall mean transmission. Therefore, the
self-normalized power spectrum would be useful for the discrimination among
models without the uncertainties caused by free (or fitting) parameters.

absorptions that cannot be conveniently extracted from individual spectra. We
apply a new technique in which fluxes from each echelle order of a short
wavelength IUE spectrum are binned together to construct low-resolution spectra
of a rapidly varying B or Be star. The ratio of binned spectra obtained bright-
star and faint-star phases contains information about the mechanism responsible
for a star's variability, such as from pulsations or occultations of the star
by ejected matter. We model the variations caused by these mechanism by means
of model atmosphere and absorbing-slab codes. Line absorptions strength changes
are sensitive to conditions in circumstellar clouds with T = 8,000--13,000K. To
demonstrate proofs of concept, we construct spectral ratios for circumstellar
structures associated with flux variability in various Be stars: (1) Vela X1
has bow-shock wind trailing its neutron star companion and shows signatures of
gas at 13,000K or 26,000K medium in different sectors, (2) 88 Her undergoes
episodic outbursts as its UV flux fades, followed a year later by a dimming in
visible wavelengths, a result of a gray opacity that dominates as the shell
expands and cools, and (3) zeta Tau and 60 Cyg exhibit periodic spectrum and
flux changes, which match model absorptions for occulting clouds. Also, ratioed
UV spectra of strongly pulsating stars show unique spectrophotometric
signatures which can be simulated with models. An analysis of ratioed spectra
obtained for a typical sample of 18 classical Be stars known to have rapid
periodic flux variations indicates that 13 of them have ratioed spectra which
are relatively featureless or have signatures of pulsation. Ratioed spectra of
3 others in the sample are consistent with the presence of co-rotating clouds.

limited by the width of the intrinsic ellipticity distribution of background

be much smaller, implying that the signal from this higher order moment is
ultimately limited by measurement noise, and not by intrinsic scatter. We
present the computation of the octopole moment and show that current

exponential. We examine the influence of star formation, bulge formation, and
feedback on the outcome of the surface brightness distributions of the stars.
Whereas the models are succesful in reproducing high surface brightness disks,
they fail to produce exponential disks of low surface brightness. In addition,
the models predict truncation radii in the gas that occur at too high surface
density. This signals a new problem for the standard model of disk formation:
if the baryonic component of the protogalaxies out of which disk galaxies form
have the same angular momentum distribution as the dark matter, disks are too

derive the probability distribution $P(\delta_R)$ of the density contrast
within spherical cells in the quasi-linear regime for some non-Gaussian initial
conditions. We describe three such models. The first one is a straightforward
generalization of the Gaussian scenario. It can be seen as a phenomenological
description of a density field where the tails of the linear density contrast
distribution would be of the form $P_L(\delta_L) \sim
e^{-|\delta_L|^{-\alpha}}$, where $\alpha$ is no longer restricted to 2 (as in
the Gaussian case). We derive exact results for $P(\delta_R)$ in the
quasi-linear limit. The second model is a physically motivated isocurvature CDM
scenario. Our approach needs to be adapted to this specific case and in order
to get convenient analytical results we introduce a simple approximation (which
is not related to the gravitational dynamics but to the initial conditions).
Then, we find a good agreement with the available results from numerical
simulations for the pdf of the linear density contrast for $\delta_{L,R} \ga
0$. We can expect a similar accuracy for the non-linear pdf $P(\delta_R)$.
Finally, the third model corresponds to the small deviations from Gaussianity
which arise in standard slow-roll inflation. We obtain exact results for the
pdf of the density field in the quasi-linear limit, to first-order over the
primordial deviations from Gaussianity.

These spectrally selected subsets are defined using a new parameter, eta, which
is a linear combination of the first two projections derived from a Principal
Component Analysis. This parameter eta identifies the average emission and
absorption line strength in the galaxy rest-frame spectrum and hence is a
useful indicator of the present star formation. We use a total of 75,000
galaxies in our calculations, chosen from a sample of high signal-to-noise
ratio, low redshift galaxies observed before January 2001. We find that there
is a systematic steepening of the faint end slope (alpha) as one moves from
passive (alpha = -0.54) to active (alpha = -1.50) star-forming galaxies, and
that there is also a corresponding faintening of the rest-frame characteristic
magnitude M* - 5\log_10(h) (from -19.6 to -19.2). We also show that the
Schechter function provides a poor fit to the quiescent (Type 1) LF for very
faint galaxies (M - 5log_10(h) fainter than -16.0), perhaps suggesting the
presence of a significant dwarf population. The luminosity functions presented

Instruments (0.1-200 keV) of the SAX satellite. The measured spectrum is a
power law with a photon index of ~1.7 modified by an ultrasoft X-ray excess and
a high-energy cutoff above ~100 keV. The soft excess is consistent with a
blackbody with temperature of ~40 eV and a low flux, while the cut-off power
law is well fitted by thermal Comptonization in a plasma with an electron
temperature of 100 keV and an optical depth of order of unity. Consistent with
the weakness of the blackbody, Compton reflection is weak. Though the data are
consistent with various geometries of the hot and cold phases of the accreting
gas, we conclude that a hot accretion disk is the most plausible model. The
Eddington ratio implied by recent estimates of the mass and the distance is
about 10^{-3}, which may indicate that advection is probably not the dominant
cooling mechanism. We finally suggest that the reflecting medium has a low

a model system for the sequence-structure problem omnipresent in biopolymers.
Several toy energy models are introduced to allow detailed analytical and
numerical studies. First, a two-replica calculation is performed. By mapping
the two-replica problem to the denaturation of a single homogeneous RNA in
6-dimensional embedding space, we show that sequence disorder is perturbatively
irrelevant, i.e., an RNA molecule with weak sequence disorder is in a molten
phase where many secondary structures with comparable total energy coexist. A
numerical study of various models at high temperature reproduces behaviors
characteristic of the molten phase. On the other hand, a scaling argument based
on the extremal statistics of rare regions can be constructed to show that the
low temperature phase is unstable to sequence disorder. We performed a detailed
numerical study of the low temperature phase using the droplet theory as a
guide, and characterized the statistics of large-scale, low-energy excitations
of the secondary structures from the ground state structure. We find the
excitation energy to grow very slowly (i.e., logarithmically) with the length
scale of the excitation, suggesting the existence of a marginal glass phase.
The transition between the low temperature glass phase and the high temperature
molten phase is also characterized numerically. It is revealed by a change in
the coefficient of the logarithmic excitation energy, from being disorder
dominated to entropy dominated.

whose explicit form depends on the choice of gauge. As a first application, we
show that the asymptotic behaviour near the cosmological initial singularity

analysis suggests the name ``asymptotic silence'' to describe the evolution of

R parity invariance. The constraints of the Higgs mass bounds, the b -> s gamma

relic density of light neutralinos (including all slepton neutralino
coannihilation effects) are included in the analysis. For universal soft
breaking, the Higgs and b -> s gamma bounds puts a lower bound m_1/2 >~ 300
GeV, most of the parameter space now falling in the co-annihilation region. The
2 sigma lower bound on the magnetic moment anomaly places an upper bound of
m_1/2 ~< 800 GeV. It is seen that mSUGRA requires that a_mu ~< 50 \times
10^{-10}. One finds for m_h > 114 GeV, that tan beta > 5(7) for A_0 = 0(-4
m_1/2) and for m_h > 120 GeV, one has tan beta > 15 (10) for A_0 = 0(-4m_1/2).

the development of a composite photon theory. His obsession with obtaining Bose
statistics for the composite photon made it easy for Pryce to prove his theory
untenable. Pryce also indicated that forming transversely-polarized photons
from neutrino-antineutrino pairs was impossible, but others have shown that
this is not a problem. Following Pryce, Berezinskii has proven that any
composite photon theory (using fermions) is impossible if one accepts five
assumptions. Thus, any successful composite theory must show which of
Berezinskii's assumptions is not valid. A method of forming composite particles
based on Fermi and Yang's model will be discussed. Such composite particles
have properties similar to conventional photons. However, unlike the situation
with conventional photon theory, Lorentz invariance can be satisfied without
the need for gauge invariance or introducing non-physical photons.

meson sector of QCD at finite temperature. Unphysical quark production
thresholds in the NJL model are excluded by an infrared cut-off in the momentum
integration within quark loop diagrams. This chiral quark model satisfies the
low energy theorems. Using the vacuum masses and decay widths of \pi- and
\rho-mesons for fixing the model parameters, the properties of the \sigma-
meson are derived. Within the Matsubara formalism, the model is systematically
extended to finite temperatures where chiral symmetry restoration due to a
dropping constituent quark mass entails a vanishing of the infrared cut-off
(deconfinement) at the pion Mott temperature T_c=186 MeV. Besides of the pion
mass and weak decay constant, the masses, coupling constants and decay widths
of \sigma- and \rho-mesons in hot matter are investigated. The quark-antiquark
decay channel of the light mesons is opened for T>T_c only and becomes
particularly strong for the \rho- meson. The two-pion decay channel below T_c
has almost constant width for the \rho- meson up to T_c, but for the
\sigma-meson it closes below T_c such that a scalar meson state with vanishing
width is obtained as a precursor of the chiral/deconfinement transition.

calculate probabilities for observations, one has to trace out over

with one or more gravitinos, and non-supersymmetric combinations of BPS branes.
This ``brane supersymmetry breaking'' raises the issue of consistency for the
resulting gravitino couplings, and Dudas and Mourad recently provided
convincing arguments to this effect for the ten-dimensional $USp(32)$ model.
These rely on a non-linear realization of local supersymmetry {\it \`a la}
Volkov-Akulov, although no gravitino mass term is present, and the couplings
have a nice geometrical interpretation in terms of ``dressed'' bulk fields,
aside from a Wess-Zumino-like term, resulting from the supersymmetrization of
the Chern-Simons couplings. Here we show that {\it all} couplings can be given
a geometrical interpretation, albeit in the dual 6-form model, whose bulk
includes a Wess-Zumino term, so that the non-geometric ones are in fact
demanded by the geometrization of their duals. We also determine the low-energy
couplings for six-dimensional (1,0) models with brane supersymmetry breaking.
Since these include both Chern-Simons and Wess-Zumino terms, only the resulting
field equations are geometrical, aside from contributions due to vectors of
supersymmetric sectors.

Phys. A: Math. Gen. 34, 11059 (2001)","10.1088/0305-4470/34/49/321",,"quant-ph",,"  A new kind of deformed calculus (the D-deformed calculus) that takes place in
fractional-dimensional spaces is presented. The D-deformed calculus is shown to
be an appropriate tool for treating fractional-dimensional systems in a simple
way and quite analogous to their corresponding one-dimensional partners. Two
simple systems, the free particle and the harmonic oscillator in fractional-
dimensional spaces are reconsidered into the framework of the D-deformed
quantum mechanics. Confined states in a D-deformed quantum well are studied.
D-deformed coherent states are also found.

interaction of the spins with an arbitrary time-dependent magnetic field and
the internal interaction of the spins, respectively. We show that if $H'(t)$ is
rotationally invariant, then $H_s(t)$ admits the same dynamical invariant as
$H_0(t)$. A direct application of this observation is a straightforward
rederivation of the results of Yan et al [Phys. Lett. A, Vol: 251 (1999) 289

  Relative-Collapse Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics as Compared to the
  Conventional One","15 pages, Latex",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Analyzing two standard preparators, the Stern-Gerlach and the
hole-in-the-screen ones, it is demonstrated that four entities are the basic
ingredients of the theory: the composite-system preparator-plus-object state
(coming about as a result of a suitable interaction between the subsystems), a
suitable preparator observable, one of its characteristic projectors called the
triggering event, and, finally, the conditional object state corresponding to
the occurrence of the triggering event. The concepts of a conditional state and
of retrospective apparent ideal occurrence are discussed in the conventional
interpretation of quantum mechanics. In the general theory of a preparator in
this interpretation first-kind and second-kind preparators are distinguished.
They are described by the same entities in the same way, but in terms of
different physical mechanisms. In this article the relative-collapse
interpretation is extended to encompass also preparators (besides measuring
apparatuses). In this interpretation also the mechanisms become the same and
one has only one kind of preparators.

transfer processes based on adiabatic passage. We show that this topology is
the essential feature for the analysis of the population transfers and the
prediction of its final result. We reinterpret diverse known processes, such as
stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP), frequency-chirped adiabatic
passage and Stark-chirped rapid adiabatic passage (SCRAP). Moreover, using this
picture, we display new related possibilities of transfer. In particular, we
show that we can selectively control the level which will be populated in
STIRAP process in Lambda or V systems by the choice of the peak amplitudes or
the pulse sequence.
