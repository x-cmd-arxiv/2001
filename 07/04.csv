evolution from the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) to the Pleiades and the Hyades.
We demonstrate that observations of the Pleiades and Hyades place tight
constraints on the angular momentum loss rate from stellar winds. The observed
periods, masses and ages of ONC stars in the range 0.2--0.5 M$_\odot$, and the
loss properties inferred from the Pleiades and Hyades stars, are then used to
test the initial conditions for stellar evolution models. We use these models
to estimate the distribution of rotational velocities for the ONC stars at the
age of the Pleiades (120 Myr). The modeled ONC and observed Pleiades
distributions of rotation rates are not consistent if only stellar winds are
included. In order to reconcile the observed loss of angu lar momentum between
these two clusters, an extrinsic loss mechanism such as protostar-accretion
disk interaction is required. Our model, which evolves the ONC stars with a
mass dependent saturation threshold normalized such that $\omega_{crit} = 5.4
\omega_\odot$ at 0.5 \m, and which includes a distribution of disk lifetimes
that is uniform over the range 0--6 Myr, is consistent with the Pleiades. This
model for disk-locking lifetimes is also consistent with inferred disk
lifetimes from the percentage of stars with infrared excesses observed in young
clusters. Different models, using a variety of initial period distributions and
different maximum disk lifetimes, are also compared to the Pleiades. For
disk-locking models that use a uniform distribution of disk lifetimes over the
range 0 to $\tau_{max}$, the acceptable range of the maximum lifetime is $3.5 <

H2 absorption (column density ~10**20 g/cm**2), which appears at a radial

the binary system difficult. The only well-detected emission lines are He II,

a hot settling flow around a rapidly rotating neutron star. The flow is
cooling-dominated and energetically similar to the Shapiro, Lightman, & Eardley

one might suspect that the new solution would also be unstable. However, due to
the very high temperature of the accreting gas, thermal conduction is very
strong and could suppress the thermal instability. We analyze the role of
thermal conduction in both the hot settling flow and the SLE solution. In the
hot settling flow collisions are very rare. Therefore, thermal transport occurs
via free streaming of electrons along tangled magnetic field lines. We find
that conduction is strong enough to make the flow marginally stable. In
contrast, in the cooler SLE solution, conduction is via collisional,
Spitzer-type transport. In this case, conduction is weaker, and we find that
the SLE solution is thermally unstable even in the presence of conduction.

spectra are available; for Cyg X-1, SMC X-1, and LMC X-4 low-resolution spectra
are used. In order to account for the non-monotonic velocity structure of the
stellar wind, a modified version of the Sobolev Exact Integration (SEI) method
by Lamers et al. (1987) is applied. The orbital modulation of the UV resonance
lines provides information on the size of the Stroemgren zone surrounding the
X-ray source. The amplitude of the observed orbital modulation (known as the
Hatchett-McCray effect), however, also depends on the density- and velocity
structure of the ambient wind. Model profiles are presented that illustrate the
effect on the appearance of the HM effect by varying stellar-wind parameters.
The q parameter of Hatchett & McCray (1977), as well as other parameters
describing the supergiant's wind structure, are derived for the 5 systems. The
X-ray luminosity needed to create the observed size of the Stroemgren zone is
consistent with the observed X-ray flux. The derived wind parameters are
compared to those determined in single OB supergiants of similar spectral type.
Our models naturally explain the observed absence of the HM effect in
4U1700-37. The orbital modulation in Vela X-1 indicates that besides the
Stroemgren zone other structures are present in the stellar wind (such as a
photo-ionization wake). The ratio of the wind velocity and the escape velocity
is found to be lower in OB supergiants in HMXBs than in single OB supergiants
of the same effective temperature.

order with respect to the hierarchical one (i.e., stars and black holes in
bigger dark halos formed before those in smaller ones) during an early episode
of vigorous star formation. This scenario closely resembles the so-called
`inverse wind' model invoked to explain the observed increase of the [Mg/Fe]
ratio in the nuclei of ellipticals with increasing the galactic mass, the only
difference being that now the time for the occurrence of a galactic wind is not
determined by the energy input from supernovae, but is indeed the energy
injected by the quasar which regulates the onset of the wind phase.

X-ray band, on a daily and hourly time-scale, were not detected at optical and
UV wavelengths, which in turn exhibited much lower variability either on short
(one day) or long (several months) time-scales. The only significant optical
variations can be described as two 2--4 day events with ~10% flux variations.
We detect no significant optical line variations and thus cannot infer a

issue in the study of zero-knowledge since known zero-knowledge protocols
cannot be run in a realistic modern computing environment. In this paper we
present a concurrent zero-knowledge proof systems for all languages in NP.
Currently, the proof system we present is the only known proof system that
retains the zero-knowledge property when copies of the proof are allowed to run
in an asynchronous environment. Our proof system has $\tilde{O}(\log^2 k)$
rounds (for a security parameter $k$), which is almost optimal, as it is shown
by Canetti Kilian Petrank and Rosen that black-box concurrent zero-knowledge

  Canetti, Goldreich, Goldwasser and Micali introduced the notion of {\em
resettable} zero-knowledge, and modified an earlier version of our proof system
to obtain the first resettable zero-knowledge proof system. This protocol
requires $k^{\theta(1)}$ rounds. We note that their technique also applies to
our current proof system, yielding a resettable zero-knowledge proof for NP

sigma-model with temperature-dependent Phi^4-potential the energy functional
includes a four-derivative current-current coupling to stabilize the size of
the emerging extended topological textures. The total winding number can be
conserved by constraint. As a model for the chiral phase transition during the
cooling phase after a hadronic collision this allows to investigate the
interference of 'baryon-antibaryon' production with the developing disoriented
aligned domains. The growth of angular correlations, condensate, average
orientation is studied in dependence of texture size, quench rate, symmetry
breaking. The classical dissipative dynamics determines the rate of energy
emitted from the relaxing source for each component of the 3-vector field which
provides a possible signature for domains of Disoriented Chiral Condensate. We
find that the 'pions' are emitted in two distinct pulses; for sufficiently
small lattice size the second one carries the DCC signal, but it is strongly
suppressed as compared to simultaneous 'sigma'-meson emission. We compare the
resulting anomalies in the distributions of DCC pions with probabilities
derived within the commonly used coherent state formalism.

the generalized Drell-Hearn-Gerasimov sum rule is predicted to have a

polarized Nachtmann moments have been estimated and their Q**2-behavior has
been investigated in terms of leading and higher twists for Q**2 > 1

constant and the effects of higher orders of the perturbative series have been
estimated using soft-gluon resummation techniques. In case of the first moment
higher-twist effects are found to be quite small for Q**2 > 1 (GeV/c)**2, and
the singlet axial charge has been determined to be a0[10 (GeV/c)**2] = 0.16 +/-

soft gluon contributions, but they are still relevant at Q**2 ~ few (GeV/c)**2

the proton. Our finding suggests that spin-dependent correlations among partons
may have more impact than spin-independent ones. As a byproduct, it is also

numerical simulations of a 2D mean--field model where shown to produce grand
minima, typical of the long-term behavior of solar magnetic activity. The model
consisted of dynamo that features an $\alpha$ effect based on the buoyancy
instability of magnetic fluxtubes, which gives rise to the switching back and
forth from grand minima to ``regular'' solar behavior. In this Letter, we
report evidence from a time-series analysis of the model for the presence of
crisis--induced intermittency due to attractor--widening. We support this
finding by showing that the average duration of the minima, $<\tau>$, follows
the theoretically predicted scaling $<\tau> \sim
(C_{\delta\alpha}-C_{\delta\alpha}^*)^{-\gamma}$, where $C_{\delta\alpha}$ is
the bifurcation parameter of interest, together with other statistical
evidence. As far as we are aware, this is the first time concrete and detailed
evidence has been produced for the occurrence of this type of crisis--induced
intermittency -- due to attractor widening -- for such dynamo models.

is investigated in an experimental jet flow. In a range of about one decade of

dissipation is found to be independent on $Re_{\lambda}$, while the higher
moments of dissipation show a power-law dependence. The scaling exponents are
found to be consistent with a simple prediction based on the multifractal model
for inertial range structure functions. This is an experimental confirmation of
the connection between inertial range quantities and dissipation statistics
predicted by the multifractal approach.

of multipole giant resonances and of low-lying collective states in spherical

approximation, provide an accurate description of ground-state properties, an
excellent agreement with experimental data is also found for the excitation
energies of low-lying collective states and of giant resonances. Two points are
essential for the successful application of the RRPA in the description of
dynamical properties of finite nuclei: (i) the use of effective Lagrangians
with non-linear terms in the meson sector, and (ii) the fully consistent

convenient starting point for the derivation of several approximations:
Hartree, Hartree-Fock and two different single-particle models. The
