the Coma cluster from Mobasher et al. This catalog comprises ~300 spectra of
cluster members with magnitudes M_B=-20.5 to -14 in two areas of ~1 X 1.5 Mpc
towards the center and the SW region of the cluster. In this paper the analysis
is restricted to the 257 galaxies with no emission lines in their spectra. The
strength of the age-sensitive indices is found to correlate with galaxy
magnitude over the whole magnitude range. Similarly, the metallicity-sensitive
indices anticorrelate with magnitude. By comparing the observed indices with
model grids based on the Padova isochrones, we derive luminosity-weighted ages
and metallicities. We present the distributions of ages and metallicities for
galaxies in various magnitude bins. The mean metallicity decreases with galaxy
magnitude and, at a given luminosity, appears to be generally lower for
galaxies in the SW region of Coma as compared to the center of the cluster. A
broad range of ages, from younger than 3 Gyr to older than 9 Gyr, is found in
galaxies of any magnitude. However, systematic trends of age with luminosity
are present among galaxies in the central field. In the central Mpc of Coma, a
large fraction of galaxies at any luminosity (50-60% of the giants, >30 % of
the dwarfs) show no evidence in their central regions of star formation
occurred at redshift z<2, while the proportion of galaxies with significant
star formation occurring at intermediate (0.35<z<2) and low (z<0.35) redshifts
is found to depend on galaxy luminosity. Faint galaxies with young
luminosity-weighted ages appear to have a bimodal metallicity distribution
that, if confirmed, would point to a composite formation scenario. Finally, we
present an interpretation of the index-magnitude relations observed.

central He burning of stars in the mass range 0.8-25 Msun, as well as its
effects on the explosive yields of a 25 Msun star of solar chemical
composition. We find that the central He burning is only marginally affected by
a change in this cross section within the currently accepted uncertainty range.
The only (important) quantity which varies significantly is the amount of C
left by the He burning. Since the C(alpha,gamma)16O is efficient in a
convective core, we have also analyzed the influence of the convective mixing
in determining the final C abundance left by the central He burning. Our main
finding is that the adopted mixing scheme does not influence the final C
abundance provided the outer border of the convective core remains essentially
fixed (in mass) when the central He abundance drops below about 0.1 dex by mass
fraction; vice versa, even a slight shift (in mass) of the border of the
convective core during the last part of the central He burning could
appreciably alter the final C abundance. Hence, we stress that it is wiser to
discuss the advanced evolutionary phases as a function of the C abundance left
by the He burning rather than as a function of the efficiency of the
12C(alpha,gamma)16O reaction rate. Only a better knowledge of this cross
section and/or the physics of the convective motions could help in removing the
degeneracy between these two components. We also prolonged the evolution of the
two 25 M_sun stellar models up to the core collapse and computed the final
explosive yields.

include ROSAT and ASCA observations. Our analysis indicates that the extended
emission is non-thermal -- a result in agreement with XMM observations. The

used to investigate the lattice compression by X-ray diffraction. Under helium
gas pressure the superconducting transition temperature shows a linear decrease

the initial Tc of 37.5 K after pressure release. In the diamond-anvil cell the
application of pressure leads to a stronger Tc-decrease than in the helium gas
pressure cell, and after the release of pressure a degradation effect with
lower Tc and a broader transition compared to the first measurement at ambient

uniaxial pressure components, which cannot be avoided in a DAC at low

(CCP). We define suitable applicability conditions for the transformations
which guarantee that the input/output CCP semantics is preserved also when
distinguishing deadlocked computations from successful ones and when
considering intermediate results of (possibly) non-terminating computations.
  The system allows us to optimize CCP programs while preserving their intended
meaning: In addition to the usual benefits that one has for sequential
declarative languages, the transformation of concurrent programs can also lead
to the elimination of communication channels and of synchronization points, to
the transformation of non-deterministic computations into deterministic ones,
and to the crucial saving of computational space. Furthermore, since the
transformation system preserves the deadlock behavior of programs, it can be

part of this thesis is devoted to the extension of the analytical methods. The
meson correlation (polarization) functions are calculated in the instanton
liquid model including dynamical quark loops. The correlators are plotted and
masses and couplings of the $\sigma$, $\rho$, $\omega$, $a1$ and $f1$ are
obtained from a spectral fit. A separated analysis allows the determination of
the $\eta'$ mass too. The results agree with the experimental values on a 10%

related to the proton spin (problem). A gauge invariant gluon mass for small
momenta is also calculated. At the end of the work some predictions are given,
which do not rely on the instanton liquid model. A gauge invariant quark
propagator is calculated in the one instanton background and is compared to the
regular and singular propagator. An introduction to the skill of choosing a
suitable gauge, especially a criterium for choosing regular or singular gauge,
is given. An application is the derivation of a finite relation betweewn the
quark condensate and the QCD scale $\Lambda$, where neither an infrared cutoff

manifolds which are (non-formal) deformations of classical manifolds. The main
result of this paper is a complete description of noncommutative
three-dimensional spherical manifolds, a noncommutative version of the sphere
$S^3$ defined by basic K-theoretic equations. We find a 3-parameter family of
deformations $S^3_{\mathbf{u}}$ of the standard 3-sphere $S^3$ and a
corresponding 3-parameter deformation of the 4-dimensional Euclidean space
$\mathbb R^4$. For generic values of the deformation parameters we show that
the obtained algebras of polynomials on the deformed $\mathbb R^4_{\mathbf{u}}$
only depend on two parameters and are isomorphic to the algebras introduced by
Sklyanin in connection with the Yang-Baxter equation. It follows that different
$S^3_{\mathbf{u}}$ can span the same $\mathbb R^4_{\mathbf{u}}$. This
equivalence generates a foliation of the parameter space $\Sigma $. This
foliation admits singular leaves reduced to a point. These critical points are
either isolated or fall in two 1-parameter families $ C_{\pm}\subset \Sigma $.
Up to the simple operation of taking the fixed algebra by an involution, these
two families are identical and we concentrate here on $ C_{+}$. For $u \in
C_{+}$ the above isomorphism with the Sklyanin algebra breaks down and the
corresponding algebras are special cases of $\theta$-deformations, a notion
which we generalize in any dimension and various contexts, and study in some
details. Here, and this point is crucial, the dimension is not an artifact,
i.e. the dimension of the classical model, but is the Hochschild dimension of
the corresponding algebra which remains constant during the deformation....

Rusnak-Furnstahl models contain essentially no binding effect, in accord with
an earlier calculation by Birse. These models are found to obey the
Hugenholtz-van Hove theorem, which is applicable if nucleons are the only
degrees of freedom. Any model in which the entire Fock space wave function can
be represented in terms of free nucleons must obey this theorem, which implies
that all of the plus momentum is carried by nucleons, and therefore that there
will be essentially no binding effect. The explicit presence of nuclear mesons
allows one to obtain a modified form of the Hugenholtz-van Hove theorem, which
is equivalent to the often-used momentum sum rule. These results argue in favor
of a conclusion that the depletion of the deep inelastic structure function
observed in the valence quark regime is due to some interesting effect
involving dynamics beyond the conventional nucleon-meson treatment of nuclear
physics.

dynamic coupling is allowed in the near field, that is, for frequencies roughly
below ~c/r for virtual exchanges between two elementary entities. It is also
valid for tunneling photons from very distant and red-shifted matter in the
radiation gauge. In this case, the near magnetic field can be safely ignored. I
treat the problem using Planck's and Post's ensemble description of harmonic
oscillators. It is found that the correlated interacting modes have lower eigen
frequencies and positive zero-modes, their anticorrelating counterparts having
higher eigenfrequencies and negative zero-modes. While the former tend to
induce coherent states over large ensembles, the latter cannot. This applies to
all the modes of the near field, as well as to the transverse radiant modes. As
a result, an attractive -1/r long-range potential is found in all the
zero-modes of the near field, with a cosmological constant depending on the
disorder in the system, provided that the interacting modes be most strongly
cohered from the far infrared. This occurs naturally in Yilmaz's cosmology,
where the Zitterbewegung of very distant matter is felt in the far infrared by
the Zitterbewegung of local matter, in proportion to the frequencies of both,
which agrees with the principle of equivalence. The Machian inertia appears on
cosmic scales from bound coherent states through this tunneling electromagnetic
radiation. In an elliptic Universe, the very low frequency modes of the coupled
oscillators can be identified with those of their radiative antipodal image. As
a result, far infrared coherent modes are expected to arise in the Universe
that lies within their realm, in which the local oscillators intrinsically
partake, inducing gravity.
