our search covering an area of 108 sq. arcmin. we have found 895 variable
stars: 96 eclipsing binaries, 349 Cepheids, and 450 other periodic, possible
long period or non-periodic variables. Of these variables 612 are newly
discovered. Their light curves were extracted using the ISIS image subtraction
package. For 77% of the variables we present light curves in standard V and B
magnitudes, with the remaining 23% expressed in units of differential flux. We
have discovered a population of first overtone Cepheid candidates and for six
of them we present strong arguments in favor of this interpretation. The

downstream of the moon, before the solar wind has infilled the wake region,
then evolves in the solar wind rest frame. An ambipolar electric field and a
potential well are generated by the electrons, which subsequently create a
counter-streaming beam distribution, causing a two-stream instability which
confines the electrons. This also creates a number of electron phase space

generating a two stream distribution with phase space mixing that is strongly
influenced by the potentials created by the electron two-stream instability.
The simulations compare favourably with WIND observations.

the N_e towards the Vela pulsar. Finally, the complete parallax data base
allows for a better measurement of the Vela pulsar proper motion
(mu_alpha(cos(delta))=-37.2 +/- 1.2 mas/yr; mu_delta=28.2 +/- 1.3 mas/yr after

implies a transverse velocity of ~65 km/s. Moreover, the proper motion position
angle appears specially well aligned with the axis of symmetry of the X-ray

universe, using hydrodynamic cosmological simulations. Assuming that most of
the emission from newly formed stars is absorbed and reradiated in the
rest-frame far-IR, we calculate the number of galaxies that would be detected
in sub-mm surveys conducted with SCUBA. The predicted number counts are
strongly dependent on the assumed dust temperature and emissivity law. With
plausible choices for SED parameters (e.g., T=35 K, beta=1.0), the simulation
predictions reproduce the observed number counts above ~ 1 mJy. The sources
have a broad redshift distribution with median z ~ 2, in reasonable agreement
with observational constraints. However, the predicted count distribution may
be too steep at the faint end, and the fraction of low redshift objects may be
larger than observed.
  In this physical model of the sub-mm galaxy population, the objects detected
in existing surveys consist mainly of massive galaxies (several M_*) forming
stars fairly steadily over timescales ~ 10^8-10^9 years, at moderate rates ~100
Msun/yr. The typical descendants of these sub-mm sources are even more massive
galaxies, with old stellar populations, found primarily in dense environments.
While the resolution of our simulations is not sufficient to determine galaxy
morphologies, these properties support the proposed identification of sub-mm
sources with massive ellipticals in the process of formation. The most robust
and distinctive prediction of this model, stemming directly from the long
timescale and correspondingly moderate rate of star formation, is that the
far-IR SEDs of SCUBA sources have a relative high 850 micron luminosity for a
given bolometric luminosity. [Abridged]

Increasing Omega_b does not change the fraction of baryons in the diffuse

and therefore transfers some baryons from the shocked intergalactic phase to
the condensed phase associated with galaxies. Predictions of Lyman-alpha forest
absorption are almost unaffected by changes of Omega_b provided that the UV
background intensity is adjusted so that the mean opacity of the forest matches
the observed value. The required UV background intensity scales as Omega_b^1.7,
and the higher photoionization rate increases the gas temperature in low
density regions. Damped Lyman-alpha absorption and Lyman limit absorption both
increase with increasing Omega_b, though the impact is stronger for damped
absorption and is weaker at z=4 than at z=2-3. The mass of cold gas and stars
in high-redshift galaxies increases faster than Omega_b but slower than
Omega_b^2, and the global star formation rate scales approximately as
Omega_b^1.5. In the higher Omega_b models, the fraction of baryonic material
within the virial radius of dark matter halos is usually higher than the
universal fraction, indicating that gas dynamics and cooling can lead to
over-representation of baryons in virialized systems. On the whole, our results
imply a fairly intuitive picture of the influence of Omega_b on high-redshift

demonstrate the existence of a galaxy proximity effect, in that galaxies in the
vicinities of QSOs do not show the same incidence and extent of gaseous
envelopes as galaxies far from QSOs. We show that the galaxy proximity effect
exists to galaxy-QSO velocity separations of ~ 3000 km/s, much larger than the
size of a typical cluster (~ 1000 km/s), i.e. it is more comparable to the
scale of the sphere of influence of QSO ionizing radiation rather than the
scale of galaxy-QSO clustering. This indicates that the QSO ionizing radiation
rather than some dynamical effect from the cluster environment is responsible
for the galaxy proximity effect. We combine previous findings that (1) many or
most Lya absorption lines arise in extended galaxy envelopes, and (2) galaxies
cluster around QSOs to show that the magnitude of the Lya forest proximity
effect is underestimated. Consequently, determinations of the UV ionizing
background intensity using the proximity effect are likely overestimated. We
use the galaxy-QSO cross-correlation function measured from our data to
estimate the magnitude of this overestimate and find that it could be as high
as a factor of 20 at z<1. This can have strong implications for models of the
origin and evolution of the ionizing background, and may indicate that QSOs
produce sufficient ionizing flux at all redshifts to account for the entire

I first discuss the now fairly convincing evidence that some globular clusters
form in galaxy starbursts/mergers. One way these observations are valuable is
they place important constraints on the physics of the formation of globular
clusters. Moreover, it is natural to associate the typically metal-rich
clusters forming in mergers with the substantial metal-rich population of
globulars around ellipticals, thereby implying an important role for galaxy
mergers in the evolution of elliptical galaxies. I also highlight some new
observational efforts aimed at constraining how and when elliptical galaxies
and their globular cluster systems formed. These include systematic studies of
the number of globular clusters around galaxies as a function of morphological
type, studies of the kinematics of globular cluster populations in elliptical
galaxies, and a variety of observational programs aimed at constraining the
relative ages of globular clusters within galaxies as a function of cluster
metallicity. The understanding of the formation of globular cluster systems and
their host galaxies has grown dramatically in recent years, and the future
looks equally promising.

  clarity; no changes to equations, figures, or conclusions",,"10.1086/323358",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a series of simple, largely analytical models to compute the
effects of disruption on the mass function of star clusters. Our calculations
include evaporation by two-body relaxation and gravitational shocks and mass
loss by stellar evolution. We find that, for a wide variety of initial
conditions, the mass function develops a turnover or peak and that, after 12
Gyr, this is remarkably close to the observed peak for globular clusters, at
M_p = 2 10^5 solar masses. Below the peak, the evolution is dominated by
two-body relaxation, and the mass function always develops a tail of the form
psi(M) = const, reflecting that the masses of tidally limited clusters decrease
linearly with time just before they are destroyed. This also agrees well with
the empirical mass function of globular clusters in the Milky Way. Above the
peak, the evolution is dominated by stellar evolution at early times and
gravitational shocks at late times. These processes shift the mass function to
lower masses while nearly preserving its shape. The radial variation of the
mass function within a galaxy depends on the initial position-velocity
distribution of the clusters. We find that some radial anisotropy in the
initial velocity distribution, especially when this increases outward, is
needed to account for the observed near-uniformity of the mass functions of
globular clusters. This may be consistent with the observed near-isotropy of
the present velocity distributions because clusters on elongated orbits are
preferentially destroyed. These results are based on models with static,
spherical galactic potentials. We point out that there would be even more
radial mixing of the orbits and hence more uniformity of the mass function if
the galactic potentials were time-dependent and/or non-spherical.

  We show how it is possible to partition any given ORC into two distinct
dynamical regions - an interior region and an exterior region. Each of the
samples considered is partitioned in this way, so that we are able to consider
the dynamics on the exterior parts of the ORCs for each of the samples. This
technique was originaly introduced by Roscoe astro-ph/0107305.
  We then find that the dynamics in the exterior part of spiral discs fall into
one of four sharply defined classes. Taking account of the various correlations
which exist between luminosity properties and dynamical properties of discs,
our final phenomonological conclusion is that spiral discs in the samples
considered appear constrained to occupy one of four distinct planes, F(M,S,a) =
k0, k1, k2, k3, where M = absolute magnitude, S = surface brightness, ""a"" is a
parameter computed directly from each ORC and k0, k1, k2, k3 are well defined

  We compare our results with high-quality higher-abundance literature data for
other metal-poor stars and with the canonical Galactic chemical enrichment
results of Timmes et al. (1995) and obtain the following basic results: (1)
Large supersolar values of [C/Fe] and [N/Fe], not predicted by the canonical
models, exist at lowest abundance. For C at least, the result is difficult to
attribute to internal mixing effects; (2) We confirm that there is {\it no
upward trend} in [$\alpha$/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H], in contradistinction to
some reports of the behavior of [O/Fe]; (3) The abundances of aluminum, after
correction for non-LTE effects, are in fair accord with theoretical prediction;
(4) We confirm earlier results concerning the Fe-peak elements that [Cr/Fe] and
[Mn/Fe] decrease at lowest abundance, while [Co/Fe] increases -- behaviors that
had not been predicted. We find, however, that [Ni/Fe] does not vary with
[Fe/H], and at [Fe/H] ~ -3.7, [Ni/Fe] = +0.08 +/- 0.06. This result appears to
be inconsistent with the supernova models of Nakamura et al. (1999) that seek
to understand the observed behavior of the Fe-peak elements by varying the
position of the model mass cut relative to the Si-burning regions.

insulators. Superconductivity arises when they are properly doped away from
stoichiometry1. In Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x, superconductivity results from doping with
excess oxygen atoms, which introduce positive charge carriers (holes) into the
CuO2 planes, where superconductivity is believed to originate. The role of
these oxygen dopants is not well understood, other than the fact that they
provide charge carriers. However, it is not even clear how these charges
distribute in the CuO2 planes. Accordingly, many models of high-Tc
superconductors simply assume that the charge carriers introduced by doping
distribute uniformly, leading to an electronically homogeneous system, as in
ordinary metals. Here we report the observation of an electronic inhomogeneity
in the high-Tc superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x using scanning tunnelling
microscopy/spectroscopy. This inhomogeneity is manifested as spatial variations
in both the local density of states spectrum and the superconducting energy

length scale of ~ 14 Angs. Analysis suggests that the inhomogeneity observed is
a consequence of proximity to a Mott insulator resulting in poor screening of
the charge potentials associated with the oxygen ions left behind in the BiO
plane after doping. Hence this experiment is a direct probe of the local nature
of the superconducting state, which is not easily accessible by macroscopic

excitations by the vortex stems from a translationally invariant interaction
potential which, expanded to first order in the vortex velocity operator, gives
rise to vortex transitions between nearest Landau levels. The corresponding
friction coefficient is shown to be, in the limit of elastic scattering
(vanishing cyclotron frequency), equivalent to that arising from the Iordanskii
formula. Proposing a simple functional form for the scattering amplitude, with
only one adjustable parameter whose value is set in order to get agreement to
the Iordanskii result for phonons, an excellent agreement is also found with
the values derived from experimental data up to temperatures about 1.5 K.
Finite values of the cyclotron frequency arising from recent theories are shown
to yield similar results. The incidence of vortex-induced quasiparticle
transitions on the friction process is estimated to be, in the roton dominated
regime, about 50 % of the value of the friction coefficient, $\sim$8 % of which
corresponds to roton-phonon transitions and $\sim$42 % to roton

following the transformation-based learning paradigm \cite{brill95:tagging} to
be applied to multiple classification tasks by training jointly and
simultaneously on all fields. The motivation for constructing such a system
stems from the observation that many tasks in natural language processing are
naturally composed of multiple subtasks which need to be resolved
simultaneously; also tasks usually learned in isolation can possibly benefit
from being learned in a joint framework, as the signals for the extra tasks
usually constitute inductive bias.
  The proposed algorithm is evaluated in two experiments: in one, the system is
used to jointly predict the part-of-speech and text chunks/baseNP chunks of an
English corpus; and in the second it is used to learn the joint prediction of
word segment boundaries and part-of-speech tagging for Chinese. The results
show that the simultaneous learning of multiple tasks does achieve an
improvement in each task upon training the same tasks sequentially. The

existence of these modes and have considered damping by shear and bulk

stellar magnetic field and its role in the damping of the instability has not

secular kinematic effects which will produce differential rotation with large

discussed by Rezzolla, Lamb and Shapiro 2000, the interaction of these secular
velocity fields with a pre-existing neutron star magnetic field could result in
the generation of intense and large scale toroidal fields. Following their
derivation in the companion paper, we here discuss the numerical solution of
the evolution equations for the magnetic field. The values of the magnetic
fields obtained in this way are used to estimate the conditions under which the
r-mode instability might be prevented or suppressed. We also assess the impact
of the generation of large magnetic fields on the gravitational wave
detectability of r-mode unstable neutron stars. Our results indicate that the
signal to noise ratio in the detection of gravitational waves from the r-mode
instability might be considerably decreased if the latter develops in neutron
stars with initial magnetic fields larger than 10^10 G.

provides the most stringent bound on $\dmu$ to date. This ambiguity could be
definitively resolved by the dedicated search for $\dmu$ recently proposed. We
then consider both model-independent and supersymmetric frameworks. Under the
assumptions of scalar degeneracy, proportionality, and flavor conservation, the
theoretical expectations for $\dmu$ in supersymmetry fall just below the
proposed sensitivity. However, non-degeneracy can give an order of magnitude
enhancement, and lepton flavor violation can lead to $\dmu$ of order $10^{-22}$
e cm, two orders of magnitude above the sensitivity of the $\dmu$ experiment.
We present compact expressions for leptonic dipole moments and lepton flavor
violating amplitudes. We also derive new limits on the amount of flavor
violation allowed and demonstrate that approximations previously used to obtain
such limits are highly inaccurate in much of parameter space.

inapplicable to exclusive processes, such as the pion form factor.The main
problem is that the asymptotic of PQCD is only about one fourth of the
experimental value. We reexamine this PQCD deep problem. By including NLO power
corrections to the pion form factor, we may arrive at a perturbative
explanation for the data. The key realization is that we need to interprete
that the strong interaction coupling constant involved in the PQCD result
should be taken as an effective coupling constant under nonperturbative QCD
vaccum. This implies that one can equally identify the relevant scale for the
effective coupling constant as the factorization scale about 1 GeV. We also
find that the average momentum fraction variable locates about 0.5, which is in
favor of the asymptotic pion wave function. By employing photon-pion form
factor with NLO power corrections to factorize out the nonperturbative effects
involved in the effective coupling constant, we can extract an effective
running coupling constant, which represents an effective coupling involving in
the hard scattering subprocesses. The difference between the effective running
coupling constant and the usual perturbative running coupling constant
($\Lambda_{QCD}=0.3$ GeV) is very small for $Q^2> 1 GeV^2$. The effective
running coupling constant $\alpha_s/\pi$ is smaller than 0.2 for $Q^2>1 GeV^2$.
  This directly showes that PQCD is applicable to exclusive processes at energy
$Q^2> 1 GeV^2$. In summary, with NLO power corrections, PQCD can completely
explain the $Q^2$ spectrum of pion form factor.

to the ground state within 0.4 ms and can be fully recaptured if the
illuminated trap volume is sufficiently large. We obtain a flux of above 10^10

limited by this loss channel and thus the 3P2-production is not hampered by
inelasic collisions. If we close the loss channel by repumping the 1D2-atoms
with a 671 nm laser back into the MOT cycling transition, a non-exponential 72

clouds due to breaking of large particles in low melting layer. The Earth's
electric field polarises the droplets and they break into small negatively
charged and large positively charged fragments. A negatively charged cloud
region is formed below melting layer. The charged region induces a field, which
increases both polarisation of the breaking droplets and rate of charge
generation. An equation is derived to describe spatial and temporal variability
of the electric field, which depends on size spectrum of hydrometeors and
vertical draft velocity. The model yields an exponential growth of the electric
field strength to 105 - 106 V/m after 15 min of raining at a rate of more than
10 mm/h. The major condition for that is a downdraft with a velocity of 0.5 - 1
m/s within the melting layer. The maximum field strength in clouds is found at
+20C level where lightning strokes to aircraft are observed most frequently. In
conclusion, factors affecting the charge generation rate are analysed and
methods for experimental verification of the proposed model discussed.

the behavior of secret correlations under local operations and public

teleportation is analogous to the one-time-pad, the concept of ``pure state''
exists in the classical domain, entanglement concentration and dilution are
essentially classical secrecy protocols, and single copy entanglement
manipulations have such a close classical analog that the majorization results
are reproduced in the classical setting. This analogy allows one to import
questions from the quantum domain into the classical one, and vice-versa,
helping to get a better understanding of both. Also, by identifying classical
aspects of quantum entanglement it allows one to identify those aspects of
