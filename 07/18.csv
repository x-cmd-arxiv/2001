cluster Abell 1835. Overall, the X-ray image shows a relaxed morphology,
although we detect substructure in in the inner 30 kpc radius. Spectral
analysis shows a steep drop in the X-ray gas temperature from ~12 keV in the
outer regions of the cluster to ~4 keV in the core. The Chandra data provide
tight constraints on the gravitational potential of the cluster which can be
parameterized by a Navarro, Frenk & White (1997) model. The X-ray data allow us
to measure the X-ray gas mass fraction as a function of radius, leading to a
determination of the cosmic matter density of \Omega_m=0.40+-0.09 h_50^-0.5.
The projected mass within a radius of ~150 kpc implied by the presence of
gravitationally lensed arcs in the cluster is in good agreement with the mass
models preferred by the Chandra data. We find a radiative cooling time of the
X-ray gas in the centre of Abell 1835 of about 3x10^8 yr. Cooling flow model
fits to the Chandra spectrum and a deprojection analysis of the Chandra image
both indicate the presence of a young cooling flow (~6x10^8 yr) with an
integrated mass deposition rate of 230^+80_-50 M_o yr^-1 within a radius of 30
kpc. We discuss the implications of our results in the light of recent RGS
observations of Abell 1835 with XMM-Newton.

extrapolations of our phenomenological geocentric knowledge. We point out that
the existence of a living organism, and a population of organisms, requires the
existence of available energy or, more precisely, available power per unit
volume (Sect. 1). This is not a geocentric concept, but a principle that
belongs to the foundations of thermodynamics. A quest about availability in the
Universe is justified. We discuss the case in which power comes from mining
(Sect. 2), and from thermal disequilibrium (Sect. 3). Thermal disequilibrium
may show up in two ways: on planets without a star (Sect. 4), and on planets
where the surface thermal disequilibrium is dominated by the incoming photon
flux from the nearest star (Sect. 6). In the first case we study the
availability by simulating the structure of the planet with a simple model that
contains the general features of the problem. For the first case we show that
the availability is in general very small (Sect. 5). In the second case we show
that the availability is in general large; the order of magnitude depends first
of all on the star's temperature and the planet's orbit, but is also controlled
by the greenhouse gases present on the planet.

temperature agrees well with the observed velocity dispersion and that found
from weak lensing. We are also able to make the first positive identification
of an iron line in this cluster and find a value of 0.26 +/- 0.15 for the
abundance relative to solar, consistent with early enrichment of the ICM. We
confirm significant substructure in the form of two distinct clumps in the
X-ray distribution. The eastern clump seems to coincide with the main cluster
component. It has a temperature of 10.5 +3.4 -2.1 keV, approximately the same
as the average spectral temperature for the whole cluster. The western clump is
cooler, with a temperature of 6.7 +1.7 -1.2 and may be a subgroup falling into
the cluster. Though the presence of substructure indicates that this cluster is
not fully relaxed, cluster simulations suggest that we will underestimate the
mass, and we can, therefore, use the mass to constrain Omega_m. From the
overall cluster X-ray temperature we find the virial mass of the cluster to be
at least 4.5 x 10^14 h^{-1} M_{\odot}. We revisit the cosmological implications
of the existence of such a hot, massive cluster at a relatively early epoch.
Despite the lower temperature, we still find that the existence of this cluster
constrains Omega_m to be less than one. If Omega_m = 1 and assuming Gaussian
initial perturbations, we find the probability of observing MS 1054 in the EMSS
is ~7 x 10^{-4}.

enables us to numerically follow the acceleration and propagation of the wind
from the disk surface to arbitrarily large distances and the collimation of
part of the wind into a dense, narrow ``jet'' around the rotation axis. Special
attention is paid to the shape of the jet and its mass flux relative to that of
the whole wind. The mass flux ratio is a measure of the jet formation

Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2000cx in the S0 galaxy NGC 524, which reveal it to be
peculiar. Photometrically, SN 2000cx is different from all known SNe Ia, and
its light curves cannot be fit well by the fitting techniques currently
available. There is an apparent asymmetry in the $B$-band peak, in which the
premaximum brightening is relatively fast (similar to that of the normal SN
1994D), but the postmaximum decline is relatively slow (similar to that of the
overluminous SN 1991T). The color evolution of SN 2000cx is also peculiar: the
$(B - V)_0$ color has a unique plateau phase and the $(V - R)_0$ and $(V -
I)_0$ colors are very blue.
  Although the premaximum spectra of SN 2000cx are similar to those of SN
1991T-like objects (with weak Si II lines), its overall spectral evolution is
quite different. The Si II lines that emerged near maximum $B$-band brightness
stay strong in SN 2000cx until about three weeks past maximum. The change in
the excitation stages of iron-peak elements is slow. Both the iron-peak and the

important role in modern cosmology. The most direct test of this hypothesis
consists in testing Gaussianity of the CMB maps. Counting the pixels with the
temperatures in given ranges and thus estimating the one point probability
function of the field is the simplest of all the tests. Other usually more
complex tests of Gaussianity generally use a great deal of the information
already contained in the probability function. However, the most interesting
outcome of such a test would be the signal of non-Gaussianity independent of
the probability function. It is shown that the independent information has
purely morphological character i.e. it depends on the geometry and topology of
the level contours only. As an example we discuss in detail the quadratic model
$v=u+\alpha (u^2-1)$ ($u$ is a Gaussian field with $\bar{u}=0$ and $<u^2>=1$,
$\alpha$ is a parameter) which may arise in slow-roll or two-field inflation
models. We show that in the limit of small amplitude $\alpha$ the full
information about the non-Gaussianity is contained in the probability function.
If other tests are performed on this model they simply recycle the same
information. A simple procedure allowing to assess the sensitivity of any
statistics to the morphological information is suggested. We provide an
analytic estimate of the statistical limit for detecting the quadratic
non-Gaussianity $\a_c$ as a function of the map size in the ideal situation
when the scale of the field is resolved. This estimate is in a good agreement
with the results of the Monte Carlo simulations of $256^2$ and $1024^2$ maps.
The effect of resolution on the detection quadratic non-Gaussianity is also
briefly discussed.

decreases toward regions with high intensity, suggesting that the dust

of all stars in the local universe. For the 81 galaxies with measured

photometry which generally spans the range 900--5500 AA in the rest-frame.
While there are only weak constraints on the parameters for most of the
individual galaxies, there are strong trends in the sample as a whole. A
unified scenario which accounts for the observed trends in bright LBGs is one
in which a relatively short period of very rapid star-formation (hundreds of
M_sun/yr) lasts for roughly 50--100 Myr, after which both the extinction and
star-formation rate are considerably reduced and stars are formed at a more

investigate the tails of the probability distribution $P(\rho_R)$ of the

finite (up to the first subleading term), that is for power-spectra with
$-3<n<-1$. Over the range $-1<n<1$ some shell-crossing occurs (which leads to
the break-up of perturbative approaches) but this does not invalidate our
approach. In particular, we explain that we can still obtain an approximation
for the low-density tail of the pdf. This feature also clearly shows that
perturbative results should be viewed with caution (even when they are finite).
We point out that our results can be recovered by a simple spherical model but
they cannot be derived from the stable-clustering ansatz in the regime $\sigma
\gg 1$ since they involve underdense regions which are still expanding. Second,
turning to high-density regions we explain that a naive study of the radial
spherical dynamics fails. Indeed, a violent radial-orbit instability leads to a
fast relaxation of collapsed halos (over one dynamical time) towards a roughly
isotropic equilibrium velocity distribution. Then, the transverse velocity
dispersion stabilizes the density profile so that almost spherical halos obey
the stable-clustering ansatz for $-3<n<1$. We again find that our results for
the high-density tail of the pdf agree with a simple spherical model (which
takes into account virialization). Moreover, they are consistent with the
stable-clustering ansatz in the non-linear regime. Besides, our approach
justifies the large-mass cutoff of the Press-Schechter mass function (although
the various normalization parameters should be modified).

dipping, bursting, transient, low-mass X-ray binary (LMXRB) X1658-298 are

the combination of a soft disk-blackbody and a harder Comptonized component
with a small amount (1.3 10E21 atom/cm2) of low-energy absorption. In contrast,
an RXTE observation 18 months earlier during the same outburst, measured an
absorption of 5.0 10E22 atom/cm2. Such a change is consistent with a thinning
of the accretion disk as the outburst progresses. Structured residuals from the
best-fit spectral model are present which are tentatively identified with
Ne-K/Fe-L and Fe-K shell emission. The spectral changes during dips are complex
and may be modeled by a strong (~3 10E23 atom/cm2) increase in absorption of
the Comptonized component only, together with reductions in normalizations of
both spectral components. This behavior is in contrast to the ``complex
continuum'' model for X-ray dip sources, where the softer blackbody component
rapidly suffers strong absorption. It is however, similar to that found during

assumption that the selection function is described by a passively evolving
early-type galaxy population, with an effective redshift of z~1.2. This
correlation length is very similar to that of local L* elliptical galaxies
implying, at face value, no significant clustering evolution in comoving
coordinates of early-type galaxies to the limiting depth of our sample, z~1.5.
A rapidly evolving clustering bias can be designed to reproduce a null result;
however, our data do not show the corresponding strong reduction in the average
population density expected for consistency with underlying growth of the
mass-function. We discuss our data in the context of recent ideas regarding
bias evolution. The uncertainty we quote on r_0 accounts for the spikey
redshift distribution expected along relatively narrow sightlines, which we
quantify with detailed simulations. This is an improvement over the standard
use of Limber's equation which, because of its implicit assumption of a smooth
selection function, underestimates the true noise by a factor of ~ 3 for the
parameters of our survey. We propose a general recipe for the analysis of
angular clustering, suggesting that any measurement of the angular clustering

(~46), most of which are probable cluster members. As was noted by Layden et
al. (1999), the periods of the fundamental mode RR Lyrae are unusually long
compared to field stars of similar metallicity. The existence of these long
period RRab stars is consistent with Sweigart & Catelan's (1998) prediction
that the horizontal branch of NGC 6441 is unusually bright. This result implies
that the metallicity-luminosity relationship for RR Lyrae stars is not
universal. We discuss the difficulty in determining the Oosterhoff
classification of NGC 6441 due to the unusual nature of its RR Lyrae. A number
of ab-type RR Lyrae are found to be both brighter and redder than the other
probable RRab found along the horizontal branch, which may be a result of
blending with stars of redder color. A smaller than usual gap is found between
the shortest period fundamental mode and longest period first-overtone mode RR
Lyrae. We determine the reddening of the cluster to be E(B-V)=0.51+/-0.02 mag,
with substantial differential reddening across the face of the cluster. The
mean V magnitude of the RR Lyrae is found to be 17.51+/-0.02 mag resulting in a

the effects of oxygen impurities on the electronic structure of NiAl. Using the
supercell method with a 16-atom supercell we have investigated the cases where
an oxygen atom is substitutionally placed at either a nickel or an aluminum
site. Full relaxation of the atoms within the supercell was allowed. We found
that oxygen prefers to occupy a nickel site over an aluminum site with a site
selection energy of 138 mRy (21,370 K). An oxygen atom placed at an aluminum
site is found to cause a substantial relaxation of its nickel neighbors away
from it. In contrast, this steric repulsion is hardly present when the oxygen
atom occupies the nickel site and is surrounded by aluminum neighbors. We
comment on the possible relation of this effect to the pesting degradation
phenomenon (essentially spontaneous disintegration in air) in nickel
aluminides.

$Q_{c}(Y_{2})$ can be identified as the scales of onset of chiral symmetry
breaking and quark confinement in QCD, and as the cut off boundaries of a
strongly interacting infrared quark gluon phase of Quantum Chromodynamics,
intermediate between the hadronic phase of QCD and the weakly coupled
perturbative QCD regime. We investigated the pattern of variation with flavor
number $N_{f} \le 8$, of these domain boundaries of the intermediate
nonperturbative infrared QCD, and found that the two scales are correlated,
with a correlation factor $Q_{c}(Y_{2})/Q_{c}(Y_{1})$ that rises to a peak at
$N_{f} = 2$ from $N_{f} = 0$, but falls off rapidly to zero for $4 \le N_{f}

confinement while being two distinct QCD phenomena caused by two independent
component QCD forces $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$, are nevertheless closely related
phenomena of infrared nonperturbative QCD dynamics. Their correlation leads us
to a finding that quark confinement is most favored in the $N_{f} = 2$ flavor

brane surrounded by a (4+1)-dimensional bulk spacetime that is essentially
empty except for a negative cosmological constant and the various modes
associated with gravity. For such a braneworld cosmology, the difficulty of
justifying some preferred initial conditions inevitably arises. The various
proposals for inflation restricted to the brane only partially explain the
homogeneity and isotropy of the resulting braneworld universe because the
homogeneity and isotropy of the bulk must be assumed. We propose a mechanism by
which a brane surrounded by AdS space arises naturally so that the homogeneity
and isotropy of both the brane and the bulk are guaranteed. We postulate an
initial false vacuum phase of (4+1)-dimensional Minkowski or de Sitter space
subsequently decaying to a true vacuum of anti-de Sitter space, assumed
discretely degenerate. This decay takes place through bubble nucleation. When
two bubbles of the true AdS vacuum collide, a brane (or domain wall) inevitably
forms between the two AdS phases. We live on this brane. The SO(3,1) symmetry
of the collision geometry ensures the three-dimensional spatial homogeneity and
isotropy of the universe on the brane as well as of the bulk. In the
semi-classical limit, this symmetry is exact. We sketch how the leading quantum
corrections translate into cosmological perturbations.

  fundamental?","30 pages ; To appear in ""General Relativity and Gravitation"", V34,
  May 2002. Minor typos corrected",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  This paper is essentially a speculation on the realization of Mach's
Principle, and we came to the details of the present analysis via the
formulation of two questions: (A) Can a globally inertial space & time be
associated with a non-trivial global matter distribution? (B) If so, what are
the general properties of such a global distribution?
  These questions are addressed within the context of an extremely simple model
universe consisting of particles possessing only the property of enumerability
existing in a formless continuum. Since there are no pre-specified ideas of
clocks and rods in this model universe, we are forced into fundamental
considerations about the nature of spatial and temporal measurement.
  In answer to the original two questions, the analysis tells us that a
globally inertial space & time can be associated with a non-trivial global
matter distribution, and that this distribution is necessarily fractal with
D=2.
  This latter result is compared with the results of modern surveys of galaxy
distributions (typically, Joyce, Montuori, Labini astro-ph/9901290, ApJ Lett
1999 and other references in this paper), which find that such distributions
are quasi-fractal with D approx = 2 on the small-to-medium scales, with the
situation on the medium-to-large scales being a topic of considerable debate.
Accordingly, and bearing in mind the extreme simplicity of the model
considered, the observational evidence is consistent with the interpretation
that the analysed point-of-view captures the cosmic reality to a good
first-order approximation. We consider the implications of these results.

dependent upon the recording interval \Delta t. Such behavior can be explained
as a consequence of the fact that the graph of a time series of an
environmental parameter such as the significant wave height has an irregular,
""fractal"" geometry. The mean duration, \bar\tau, can have a power-law
dependence on \Delta t as \Delta t -> 0, with an exponent equal to the fractal
dimension of the level sets of the time series graph. This recording interval
dependence means that the mean duration is not a well defined quantity to use
for marine operational purposes. A more practical quantity may be the ""useful
mean duration"", \bar\tau^u, estimated from the formula
(\sum\tau_i^2)/(\sum\tau_i), where each interval [t_i,t_i+\tau_i] satisfying
the appropriate criterion is weighted by its duration. These results are
illustrated using wave data from the Frigg gas field in the North Sea.

by definition, assumed to be classical. In reality, however, when such a field
is used to manipulate the quantum state of qubits, the qubits never remain
completely unentangled with the field. For quantum information processing this
is an undesirable property, as it precludes perfect quantum computing and
quantum communication. Here we consider the interaction of atomic qubits with
laser fields and quantify atom-field entanglement in various cases of interest.
We find that the entanglement decreases with the average number of photons
$\bar{n}$ in a laser beam as $E\propto\log_2 \bar{n}/\bar{n}$ for
$\bar{n}\to\infty$.

case where the oracle evaluates a unitary operator and the computer is allowed
to be in the superposition of a query state and a non-query state during
