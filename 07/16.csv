intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs and IMXBs). Using a standard
Henyey-type stellar-evolution code and a standard model for binary
interactions, we have calculated 100 binary evolution sequences containing a
neutron star and a normal-type companion star, where the initial mass of the
secondary ranges from 0.6 to 7\Ms and the initial orbital period from $\sim 4
$hr to $\sim 100 $d. This grid of models samples the entire range of parameters
one is likely to encounter for LMXBs and IMXBs. The sequences show an enormous
variety of evolutionary histories and outcomes, where different mass-transfer
mechanisms dominate in different phases. Very few sequences resemble the
classical evolution of cataclysmic variables, where the evolution is driven by
magnetic braking and gravitational radiation alone. Many systems experience a
phase of mass transfer on a thermal timescale and may briefly become detached
immediately after this phase (for the more massive secondaries). In agreement
with previous results (\markcite{Tauris1}Tauris & Savonije 1999), we find that
all sequences with (sub-)giant donors up to $\sim 2\Ms$ are stable against
dynamical mass transfer. Sequences where the secondary has a radiative envelope
are stable against dynamical mass transfer for initial masses up to $\sim
4\Ms$. (abridged)

produced ratios of the integrated intensities of our J=7-6 and 4-3 data to the

better than PDR models. The LVG models give H_2 densities of ~10^5 per ccm. The
CO outflow is probably heated by shocks. In the Orion S outflow, the CO line
intensities are lower than for Orion KL. The 4-3/2-1 line ratio is 1.3 for the
blue shifted wing and 0.8 for the red shifted wing. Emission in the jet feature
extending 2' to the SW of Orion S was detected in the J=4-3 but not the J=7-6
line; the average 4-3/2-1 line ratio is ~1. The line ratios in the Orion S
outflow and jet features are consistent with both PDR and LVG models.
Comparisons of the intensities of the J=7-6 and J=4-3 lines from the Orion Bar

Either clumping or additional heating by mechanisms such as shocks, may be the
cause of this discrepancy.

spectroscopy of galaxies selected in J (1.2 mu) with the DENIS survey was
performed at the UKST using the FLAIR II multi-object spectroscope. 69 galaxy
redshifts (z's) were obtained in a high |b| field and an additional 12 z's in a
low latitude (b=-17 deg), obscured field. This study illustrates the
feasibility of obtaining z's with optical spectra on galaxies selected at much
longer wavelengths. It validated a very preliminary algorithm for star/galaxy
separation for high |b| DENIS objects, with 99% reliability for J < 13.9.
However, the FLAIR II z determinations required substantially longer
integration times to achieve 90% completeness than expected from previous
optical surveys at comparable depth. This is mainly due to a degradation in
overall fibre throughput due to known problems with ageing of the
prism-cement-fibre interface with exposure to UV light. Our low |b| (high
extinction) field required 2.5 times more exposure time for less than 50% of
successful z measurements. Among the J <= 13.9 galaxies with measured z's, only
37+/-6% display emission lines, in comparison with 60% of emission-line
galaxies (ELGs) in optical samples of comparable depth. The ELGs are, on
average, 0.5 mag bluer in B-J than non-ELGs of the same luminosity. We confirm
a previous optically-based result that the fraction of ELGs increases rapidly
with decreasing galaxy luminosity. The J-band luminosity function is estimated.
Our high latitude field displays a concentration of galaxies at cz ~ 38000 km/s

lying near the projected centre of the Abell 1434 cluster of galaxies, for

ratios are consistent with the nucleosynthesis yield from the collapse of a 12
Msun progenitor. The abundance ratios Ne/Si, Mg/Si, Fe/Si and Ni/Si are very
variable and distinctly different from S/Si, Ar/Si and Ca/Si, in line with the
current explosive nucleosynthesis models. The ionisation age and temperature of
both NEI components varies considerably over the remnant. Accurate
determination of these parameters yield reliable Doppler velocities for both
components. The data are consistent with a plasma velocity of 2600 km/s at the
shock radius of 153"" implying a primary shock velocity of 4000+/-500 km/s. The
Si-K and S-K line emission from the cool component is confined to a relatively
narrow shell with radius 100-150"". This component is almost certainly ejecta
material which has been heated by a combination of the reverse shock and
heating of ejecta clumps as they plough through the medium which has been
pre-heated by the primary shock. The Fe-K line emission is expanding faster and
spans a radius range 110-170"". The bulk of the Fe emission is confined to two
large clumps and it is likely that these too are the result of ablation from
ejecta bullets rather swept up circumstellar medium.

E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.64.026116",,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  The decay of unstable states when several metastable states are available for
occupation is investigated using path-integral techniques. Specifically, a
method is described which allows the probabilities with which the metastable
states are occupied to be calculated by finding optimal paths, and fluctuations
about them, in the weak noise limit. The method is illustrated on a system
described by two coupled Langevin equations, which are found in the study of
instabilities in fluid dynamics and superconductivity. The problem involves a
subtle interplay between non-linearities and noise, and a naive approximation
scheme which does not take this into account is shown to be unsatisfactory. The
use of optimal paths is briefly reviewed and then applied to finding the
conditional probability of ending up in one of the metastable states, having
begun in the unstable state. There are several aspects of the calculation which
distinguish it from most others involving optimal paths: (i) the paths do not
begin and end on an attractor, and moreover, the final point is to a large
extent arbitrary, (ii) the interplay between the fluctuations and the leading
order contribution are at the heart of the method, and (iii) the final result
involves quantities which are not exponentially small in the noise strength.
This final result, which gives the probability of a particular state being
selected in terms of the parameters of the dynamics, is remarkably simple and
agrees well with the results of numerical simulations. The method should be
applicable to similar problems in a number of other areas such as state
selection in lasers, activationless chemical reactions and population dynamics
in fluctuating environments.

finalization of the LEP electroweak precision data. The recent precise
measurement of the muon g-2 of E821 experiment is explained well by the
relatively light chargino and sleptons. We find that such the MSSM parameter
space is also favored from the electroweak precision data, in which the fit to
the data is better than that of the SM (\Delta \chi^2_{min} \sim -2), if the
lighter chargino has a mixed higgsino-wino character (\mu/M_2 \sim 1). The
models with light gauginos (\mu/M_2 > 10) or light higgsinos (\mu/M_2 < 0.1)
also show the better fit over the SM, but the improvement is marginal as
compared to the case of the mixed higgsino-wino case (\mu/M_2 \sim 1).

  We will demonstrate that requiring theoretical self-consistency reduces the
freedom in modeling high energy nuclear scattering enormously.
  We will introduce a fully self-consistent formulation of the
multiple-scattering scheme in the framework of a Gribov-Regge type effective

  In addition, we develop new computational techniques which allow for the

properties of the network by tracing the motion of the string cores, for the

length, that is, the true network energy density. These results are compared
with a velocity-dependent one scale model for cosmic string network evolution.
This incorporates the contributions of loop production, massive radiation and
friction to the energy loss processes that are required for scaling evolution.
We use this analysis as a basis for discussing the relative importance of these
mechanisms for the evolution of the network. We find that the loop distribution
statistics in the simulations are consistent with the long-time scaling of the
network being dominated by loop production. Making justifiable extrapolations
to cosmological scales, these results appear to be consistent with the standard
picture of local string network evolution in which loop production and
gravitational radiation are the dominant decay mechanisms.

universe at temperatures below the electroweak phase transition temperature.
Resulting temperature fluctuations can restore the electroweak symmetry
locally, depending on the amplitude of fluctuations and the background
temperature. The symmetry will be spontaneously broken again in a given
fluctuation region as the temperature drops there (for fluctuations with length
scales smaller than the horizon), resulting in the production of baryon
asymmetry. The time scale of the transition will be governed by the wavelength
of fluctuation and, hence, can be much smaller than the Hubble time. This leads
to strong enhancement in the production of baryon asymmetry for a second order
electroweak phase transition as compared to the case when transition happens
due to the cooling of the universe via expansion. For a two-Higgs extension of
the Standard Model (with appropriate CP violation), we show that one can get
the required baryon to entropy ratio if fluctuations propagate without getting
significantly damped. If fluctuations are damped rapidly, then a volume factor
suppresses the baryon production. Still, the short scale of the fluctuation
leads to enhancement of the baryon to entropy ratio by at least 3 - 4 orders of
magnitude compared to the conventional case of second order transition where
the cooling happens due to expansion of the universe.

dynamics. The theoretical method is found to be very useful to study ground and
excited states of various nuclei covering unstable nuclei. The calculations
succeed to reproduce many experimental data for nuclear structures; energies,
radii, magnetic dipole moments, electric quadrupole moments, transition
strength. In the theoretical results it is found that various exotic phenomena
in unstable nuclei such as molecular-like structures, neutron skin, and large
deformations may appear in unstabel nuclei. We investigate the structure change
with the increase of neutron number and with the increase of the excitation
energies, and find the drastic changes between shell-model-like structures and
clustering structures. The mechanism of clustering developments in unstable
nuclei are discussed.

in frequency Doppler shift (Fd) of the ionosphere-reflected radio signal is
under investigation. The experiment on simultaneous recording of Fd variations
and geomagnetic pulsations was organised at high latitude station in Norilsk
(geomagnetic latitude and longitude 64.2 N, 160.4 E, L=5.3) during
Febrary-April of 1995-98. Thirty cases of simultaneous recording of duration
from 10 min to two hour were analysed: 6 cases of simultaneous recording of
variations Fd and regular geomagnetic pulsations Pc5; and 25 cases of recording
of Fd variations and irregular pulsations Pi2.
  On the basis of experimental results, the following conclusions have been
drawn: a) Hydromagnetic waves in the range of regular Pc5 pulsations, when
interacting with the ionospheric F2 layer, make the main contribution to
short-period Fd variations. The possible mechanism of Fd variations are
oscillations of electron density, associated with distribution of a
hydromagnetic wave in an ionosphere. b) There exists an unquestionable
interrelation between Fd variations of the sporadic E layer-reflected radio
signal and irregular Pi2 pulsations, but for some reasons it is traced poorly.

forward a superluminal theory of kinematics, in which we show that the temporal
coordinate need exchanging with one of the spatial coordinates in a
superluminal inertial frame, and that the coordinate transformations from any
superluminal inertial frame to the rest frame (here rest just says in a
relative sense) are the same as the Lorentz transformations from some normal
inertial frame to the rest frame. Consequently, the causality can not be
violated. Secondly, we investigate the superluminal theory of dynamics and find
that the total energy of any object moving at a speed of $v$ (faster than the
speed of light in vacuum $c$) is equal to the total energy of that object
moving at a speed of $u (u<c)$ provided that the product of two speeds satisfy
$uv=c^{2}$. Lastly, we conjecture that this superluminal theory can give a
novel interpretation to the essence of matter waves put forward by de Broglie.

define a Gaussian 1-to-2 cloning machine, which copies equally well two
conjugate variables such as position and momentum or the two quadrature
components of a light mode. The resulting cloning fidelity for coherent states,
namely $F=2/3$, is shown to be optimal. An asymmetric version of this Gaussian
cloner is then used to assess the security of a continuous-variable quantum key
distribution scheme that allows two remote parties to share a Gaussian key. The
information versus disturbance tradeoff underlying this continuous quantum
cryptographic scheme is then analyzed for the optimal individual attack.
Methods to convert the resulting Gaussian keys into secret key bits are also
studied. The extension of the Gaussian cloner to optimal $N$-to-$M$ continuous
cloners is then discussed, and it is shown how to implement these cloners for
light modes, using a phase-insensitive optical amplifier and beam splitters.
Finally, a phase-conjugated inputs $(N,N')$-to-$(M,M')$ continuous cloner is
defined, yielding $M$ clones and $M'$ anticlones from $N$ replicas of a
coherent state and $N'$ replicas of its phase-conjugate (with $M'-M=N'-N$).
This novel kind of cloners is shown to outperform the standard $N$-to-$M$
cloners in some situations.

depending on named transition due to reversible model of the two-level atom.
The opportunity to know the last history of the resonant event for the
absorption process is for quantum interference interaction or for the resonant
radiation. On the contrary, to predict the resonant event in the future is
possible only by use near resonant atom-field absorption or by use radiation at
a fixed time. The problem of life time for a particle is entered through time
of spontaneous radiation connected with trajectory of the quantum transition.
It is offered to connect a trajectory of a particle during quantum transitions
with distribution of probability to find a particle. The conception of the
spectral history for events due to probability distribution is introduced for
next discussion.
