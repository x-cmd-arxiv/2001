applications: the shape of the Milky Way dark halo and the shape of the LMC

determination of the axial ratio q_DH remains elusive. A very flattened Milky
Way dark halo with q_DH < 0.4 is ruled out, and values q_DH > 0.7 appear most
consistent with the data. Near-IR surveys have revealed that the LMC disk is
not approximately circular, as long believed, but instead has an axial ratio of
0.7 in the disk plane. The elongation is perpendicular to the Magellanic
Stream, indicating that it is most likely due to the tidal force of the Milky
Way. Equilibrium dynamical modeling of galaxies is important for many
applications. At the same time, detailed studies of tidal effects and tidal
streams have the potential to improve our understanding of both the Milky Way
dark halo and the structure of satellite galaxies such as the LMC.

NIR/optical/X-ray bands for 1.3 < z < 3.5 is investigated based on the
realistic QSO spectra. The accretion-disk theory predicts that although QSO
luminosities only depend on mass-accretion rate, \Mdot, QSO spectra have a
dependence on black-hole mass, M_{BH}, as well. The smaller M_{BH} is and/or
the larger \Mdot is, the harder becomes the QSO NIR/optical/UV spectrum. We
model disk spectra which can reproduce these features and calculated LFs for
redshift z ~ 3 with the assumption of new-born QSOs being shining at the
Eddington luminosity. The main results are: (i) the observed LFs at optical and
X-rays can be simultaneously reproduced. (ii) LFs at optical and X-ray bands
are not sensitive to M_{BH}, while LFs at NIR bands are; about one order of
magnitude difference is expected in volume number densities at L_{I, J} ~
10^{46} erg s^{-1} between the case that all QSOs would have the same spectral
shape as that of M_{BH} = 10^{9} M_sun and the case with M_{BH} = 10^{11}
M_sun. (iii) The resultant LFs at NIR are dominated by 10^{7} M_sun black-holes
at L_{I, J} ~ 10^{44} erg s^{-1}, and by 10^{11} M_sun black-holes at L_{I, J}
\~ 10^{46} erg s^{-1}. Future infrared observations from space(e.g.NGST) will
probe cosmological evolution of black hole masses. For redshift z < 3, on the
other hand, the observed optical/X-ray LFs can be fitted, if the initial QSO
luminosity L_0 is below the Eddington luminosity. Interestingly, the best
fitting values of l = L_0/L_{Edd} are different in B- and X-ray bands; l_B ~
2.5 l_X. The reason for this discrepancy is briefly discussed.

more elaborate calculations with a more physical viscosity prescription and
including a vertically integrated treatment of acceleration in the vertical

character, with an approximately linear temperature-dependence of the upper

by the specific heat jump with $\Delta$C = 37.9 mJ/mol-K. Using the $\gamma$

  By considering tensorial doublets, we introduce a novel well-defined notion
of self-duality based on a duality Hodge-type operation in arbitrary dimension
and for any rank of these tensors. Thus, a generalized Self-Dual Action is
defined such that equations of motion are the claimed generalized self-duality
relations. We observe in addition, that taking the proper limit on the
parameters of this action, it always provides us with a master-action, which
interpolates models well-studied in physics; by considering a particular limit,
we find an action which describes an interesting type of relation, referred to
as semi-self-duality, which results to be the parent action between Maxwell-
type actions.
  Finally, we apply these ideas to construct manifest Hodge-type self-dual
solutions in a (2+1)-dimensional version of the Maxwell's theory.

four-dimensional model, with only time dependent fields. We show that the
four-dimensional universe has an inflationary phase and graceful exit from it,

fifth dimension much larger than the others. We pay particular attention to
demonstrating the role of tachyonic matter in inducing these features. The

to a scalar field source with a Liouville potential under the assumption of D-2

yielding three classes of SO(D-2) symmetric spacetimes. In D=4 homogeneous and
isotropic subsets of these solutions yield planar scalar field cosmologies. In
D=5 they represent the general static or time-dependent backgrounds for a
dilatonic wall-type brane Universe of planar cosmological symmetry. Here we
apply these solutions as SO(8) symmetric backgrounds to non-supersymmetric 10
dimensional string theories, the open USp(32) type I string and the heterotic
string SO(16)XSO(16). We obtain the general SO(9) solutions as a particular
case. All static solutions are found to be singular with the singularity
sometimes hidden by a horizon. The solutions are not asymptotically flat or of
constant curvature. The singular behavior is no longer true once we permit
space and time dependence of the spacetime metric much like thick domain wall
or global vortex spacetimes. We analyze the general time and space dependent
solutions giving implicitly a class of time and space dependent solutions and
describe the breakdown of an extension to Birkhoff's theorem in the presence of
scalar matter. We argue that the solutions described constitute the general
solution to the field configuration under D-2 planar symmetry.

limits corresponding to both the open D3-brane theory and open D5-brane theory
for this supergravity solution as expected. However, we do not find any
non-commutative Yang-Mills theory (NCYM) limit for this solution in the
presence of NS5 branes. We then study the $SL(2, Z)$ duality symmetry of type
IIB theory for both OD3-limit and OD5-limit. We find that for OD3 theory, a
generic $SL(2, Z)$ duality always gives another OD3-theory irrespective of the
value of $\chi_0$ being rational or not. This indicates that OD3-theory is
self-dual. But, under a special set of $SL(2, Z)$ transformations for which
$\chi_0$ is rational OD3-theory goes over to a 5+1 dimensional NCYM theory and
these two theories in this case are related to each other by strong-weak
duality symmetry. On the other hand, for OD5-theory, a generic $SL(2, Z)$
duality gives another OD5-theory if $\chi_0$ is irrational, but when $\chi_0$
is rational it gives the little string theory limit indicating that OD5-theory
is S-dual to the type IIB little string theory.

resonances proved to be a powerful experimental technique for probing nuclear

were found to be as large as 10%. Here we examine the possibilities of carrying
out a parallel program to measure asymmetries in the $(n,\gamma$) reaction on
these same compound nuclear resonances. Symmetry-violating $(n,\gamma$) studies
can also show asymmetries as large as 10%, and have the advantage over
transmission experiments of allowing parity-odd asymmetries in several
different gamma-decay branches from the same resonance. Thus, studies of parity
violation in the $(n,\gamma)$ reaction using high efficiency germanium
detectors at the Los Alamos Lujan facility, for example, could determine the
parity-odd nucleon-nucleon matrix elements in complex nuclei with high
accuracy. Additionally, simultaneous studies of the E1 and $V_{PNC}$ matrix
elements invol ved in these decays could be used to help constrain the
statistical theory of parity non-conservation in compound nuclei.

entangled to each other and states in which only M particles are entangled
(with M<N). It is shown that three recent experiments to obtain three-particle
entangled states (Bouwmeester et al., Pan et al., and Rauschenbeutel et al.) do
not meet these conditions. We conclude that the question whether these
experiments provide confirmation of three-particle entanglement remains
unresolved. We also propose modifications of the experiments that would make
such confirmation feasible.
