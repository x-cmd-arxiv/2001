having time independent mechanical luminosities and that are each mass-loaded
by the hydrodynamic ablation of distributed clumps. The mass loading is
`switched-on' at a specified radius (with free-expansion of the wind interior
to this point) and injects mass at a rate per unit volume proportional to
M^delta r^lambda where delta = 4/3 (1) if the flow is subsonic (supersonic)
with respect to the clumps. In the limit of negligible mass loading a
similarity solution found by Dyson (1973) for expansion into a smooth ambient
medium is recovered. The presence of mass loading heats the flow, which leads
to a reduction in the Mach number of the supersonic freely-expanding flow, and
weaker jump conditions across the inner shock. In solutions with large mass
loading, it is possible for the wind to connect directly to the contact
discontinuity without first passing through an inner shock. For a solution that
gives the mass of swept-up ambient gas to be less than the sum of the masses of
the wind and ablated material, lambda < -2. Maximum possible values for the
ratio of ablated mass to wind mass occur when mass loading starts very close to
the bubble center and when the flow is supersonic with respect to the clumps
over the entire bubble radius. The maximum temperature in the bubble often
occurs near the onset of mass loading, and in some cases can be many times
greater than the post-inner-shock temperature. Our solutions are relevant to eg
stellar wind-blown bubbles, galactic winds, etc. This work complements Pittard
et al (2001) where it was assumed that clumps were evaporated through
conductive energy transport.

peculiar velocity field in the LSC region is complicated and is drastically
different from the field assumed in the Virgocentric infall models. The
peculiar velocity flow in the vicinity of the LG in the simulation is ``cold'':
the peculiar line-of-sight velocity dispersion within 7Mpc/h of the LG is less

We find that the LFs for quiescent galaxies have shallow faint end slopes,
while those of galaxies with detectable emission lines have steeper faint end
slopes. Furthermore these slopes are independent of redshift out to z=1.05 for
each galaxy spectral grouping and agree well with comparable local
determinations. We find that galaxies with strong absorption lines become
brighter with z with Q \sim 0.6 at all rest frame bands studied here, where Q =
\Delta{\rm{log}}[L^*(z)]/\Delta{z}, while galaxies with detectable emission
lines (i.e. star forming galaxies) show a smaller change in L^* with redshift
at all bands, Q ~ 0.3, with Q becoming significantly larger at rest frame
2400A. Passive evolution models of galaxies are in reasonable agreement with
these results for absorption line dominated galaxies, while plausible star
formation histories can reproduce the behavior of the emission line galaxies.
We find the co-moving number density and stellar mass in galaxies to be
approximately constant out to z~1.05, and with more uncertainty, to z~1.3. The

intense, about 10,000 times the intensity in the solar neighborhood. CO
emission is not detected, though the galaxy shows an extremely high global H I

galaxy's mid-infrared-to-optical and mid-to-near-infrared luminosity ratios are

compact nonthermal sources that may be radiative supernova remnants expanding
in the interclump medium of molecular clouds. Because of the high pressure in
starburst regions, the interclump medium may have a density ~ 10^3 H atoms
cm^{-3} in a starburst nucleus like M82 and ~ 10^4 H atoms cm^{-3} in an
ultraluminous galaxy like Arp 220. In M82, our model can account for the sizes,
the slow evolution, the high radio luminosities, and the low X-ray luminosities
of the sources. We predict expansion velocities ~ 500 km/s, which is slower
than the one case measured by VLBI techniques. Although we predict the remnants
to be radiative, the expected radiation is difficult to detect because it is at
infrared wavelengths and the starburst is itself very luminous; one detection
possibility is broad [OI] 63 micron line emission at the positions of the radio
remnants. The more luminous and compact remnants in Arp 220 can be accounted
for by the higher molecular cloud density. In our model, the observed remnants
lose most of the supernova energy to radiation. Other explosions in a lower

morphology. M31's strong tidal field also induces rapid gas transfer to the
central region, triggers a nuclear starburst, and consequently forms the
central high density and more metal-rich stellar populations with relatively
young ages. Thus, in this scenario, M32 was previously the bulge of a spiral
tidally interacting with M31 several Gyr ago. Furthermore, we suggest cEs like
M32 are rare, the result of both the rather narrow parameter space for tidal
interactions which morphologically transform spirals into cEs and the very
short time scale ($<$ a few $10^9$ yr) for cEs to be swallowed.

ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIGs) have revealed very luminous, young,
compact, and heavily obscured super star clusters in their central regions,
suggested to be formed by gas-rich major mergers. By using stellar and gaseous
numerical simulations of galaxy mergers, we firstly demonstrate that the
central regions of ULIGs are the most promising formation sites of super star
clusters owing to the rather high gaseous pressure of the interstellar medium.
Based on simple analytical arguments, we secondly discuss the possibility that
super star clusters in an ULIG can be efficiently transferred into the nuclear
region owing to dynamical friction and consequently merge with one another to
form a single compact stellar nucleus with a seed massive black hole. We thus
suggest that multiple merging between super star clusters formed by nuclear
starbursts in the central regions of ULIGs can result in the formation of
massive black holes.

each system. To find out the significance of the derived astrometric orbits we
applied a ""permutation"" technique by which we analyzed the permuted Hipparcos
data to get false orbits. The size distribution of these false orbits indicated
the range of possibly random, false orbits that could be derived from the true
data. These tests could not find any astrometric orbit of the planet candidates
with significance higher than 99%, suggesting that most if not all orbits are
not real. Instead, we used the Hipparcos data to set upper limits on the masses
of the planet candidates. The lowest derived upper limit is that of 47UMa -
0.014 solar mass, which confirms the planetary nature of its unseen companion.
For 13 other planet candidates the upper limits exclude the stellar nature of
their companions, although brown-dwarf secondaries are still an option. These
negate the idea that all or most of the extrasolar planets are disguised
stellar secondaries. Of the 14 brown-dwarf candidates, our analysis reproduced

$P(\delta_R)$ of the density contrast within spherical cells in the
quasi-linear regime. Indeed, since this corresponds to a rare-event limit a
steepest-descent approximation can yield asymptotically exact results. We check
that this is the case for Gaussian initial density fluctuations, where we
recover most of the results obtained by perturbative methods from a
hydrodynamical description. Moreover, we correct an error which was introduced
in previous works for the high-density tail of the pdf. This feature, which
appears for power-spectra with a slope $n<0$, points out the limitations of
perturbative approaches which cannot describe the pdf $P(\delta_R)$ for
$\delta_R \ga 3$ even in the limit $\sigma \to 0$. This break-up does not
involve shell-crossing and it is naturally explained within our framework.
Thus, our approach provides a rigorous treatment of the quasi-linear regime,
which does not rely on the hydrodynamical approximation for the equations of
motion. Besides, it is actually simpler and more intuitive than previous
methods. Our approach can also be applied to non-Gaussian initial conditions.

needed to produce the early radio and X-ray emission. The HII region is

increasing pressure at low temperatures. We further predict that

have examined the influence of chaos and noise on the front propagation speed

the reaction term acts periodically in an impulsive way, the dynamical
evolution of the system can be written as the convolution between a spatial
propagator and a discrete-time map acting locally. This approach allows us to
perform accurate numerical analysis. They reveal that in the pulled regime the
front speed is basically determined by the shape of the map around the unstable
fixed point, while its chaotic or noisy features play a marginal role. In
contrast, in the pushed regime the presence of chaos or noise is more relevant.
In particular the front speed decreases when the degree of chaoticity is
increased, but it is not straightforward to derive a direct connection between
the chaotic properties (e.g. the Lyapunov exponent) and the behaviour of the
front. As for the fluctuations of the front position, we observe for the noisy
maps that the associated mean square displacement grows in time as $t^{1/2}$ in
the pushed case and as $t^{1/4}$ in the pulled one, in agreement with recent
findings obtained for continuous models with multiplicative noise. Moreover we
show that the same quantity saturates when a chaotic deterministic dynamics is

Fermi surface is hole-like with a sufficient next-nearest-neighbor hopping
t'<0. The double-layer structure of YBCO or BSCCO is not important for the

optimal doping come out comparable to experiment. The observed qualitative
behavior of \omega_{res} with hole filling is reproduced in the underdoped as

magnetic excitation spectrum if the 2D wave-vector is integrated over. It is
caused by excitations across the maximum gap, and in contrast to the resonance
its energy is almost independent of doping. At energies above or below
\omega_{res} the commensurate resonance splits into incommensurate peaks,
located off (pi,pi). Below \omega_{res} the intensity pattern is of `parallel'

distribution of wide wires showing pure non-diagonal disorder. Following recent
works that point to unusual phenomena in some circumstances, scaling at the
band center of wires of odd widths has been numerically investigated. While the
conductance mean shows a decrease that is only proportional to the inverse
square root of the wire length, the median of the distribution exponentially
decreases as a function of the square root of the length. Actually, the whole
distribution decays as the inverse square root of the length except close to
G=0 where the distribution accumulates the weight lost at larger conductances.
It accurately follows the theoretical prediction once the free parameter is
correctly fitted. Moreover, when the number of channels equals the wire length
but contacts are kept finite, the conductance distribution is still described
by the previous model. It is shown that the common origin of this behavior is a
simple Gaussian statistics followed by the logarithm of the E=0 wavefunction
weight ratio of a system showing chiral symmetry. A finite value of the
two-dimensional conductance mean is obtained in the infinite size limit. Both
conductance and the wavefunction statistics distributions are given in this
limit. This results are consistent with the 'critical' character of the E=0
wavefunction predicted in the literature.

this extended model one obtains the non-renormalization theorems of SQED and
the counterterms of the soft breaking parameters as functions of the
supersymmetric counterterms. Due to the Adler-Bardeen anomaly of the axial
current an invariant regularization scheme does not exist, and therefore the
$\beta$-functions of soft breaking parameters are derived from an algebraic
construction of the Callan-Symanzik equation and of the renormalization group
equation. We obtain the soft $\beta$-functions in terms of the gauge
$\beta$-function and of the anomalous dimension of the supersymmetric matter

great detail, using symplectic cutting (math.AG/9804083). Examining the

explains a set of generators of the cohomology ring and a conjectured explicit

finally it introduces the resolution tower for M, and shows that its direct
limit is homotopically equivalent with the classifying space of the gauge

chaos in inclined layer convection of a fluid withPrandtl number $\approx 1$.
By measuring defect density and undulation wavenumber, we find that the onset
of undulation chaos coincides with the theoretically predicted onset for
stable, stationary undulations. At stronger driving, we observe a competition
between ordered undulations and undulation chaos, suggesting bistability
between a fixed-point attractor and spatiotemporal chaos. In the defect
turbulent regime, we measured the defect creation, annihilation, entering,
leaving, and rates. We show that entering and leaving rates through boundaries
must be considered in order to describe the observed statistics. We derive a
universal probability distribution function which agrees with the experimental

temperature for classical atomic clusters of aggregate sizes $25 \leq N \leq
60$ that were bound by pairwise Lennard-Jones potentials. The parallel
tempering method was used to overcome convergence difficulties due to
quasiergodicity in the solid-liquid phase-change regions. All of the clusters
studied had pronounced peaks in their heat capacity curves, most of which
corresponded to their solid-liquid phase-change regions. The heat capacity peak
height and location exhibited two general trends as functions of cluster size:
for $N = 25$ to 36, the peak temperature slowly increased, while the peak
height slowly decreased, disappearing by $N = 37$; for $N = 30$, a very small
secondary peak at very low temperature emerged and quickly increased in size
and temperature as $N$ increased, becoming the dominant peak by $N = 36$.
Superimposed on these general trends were smaller fluctuations in the peak
heights that corresponded to ``magic number'' behavior, with local maxima found
at $N = 36, 39, 43, 46$ and 49, and the largest peak found at $N = 55$. These
magic numbers were a subset of the magic numbers found for other cluster
properties, and can be largely understood in terms of the clusters' underlying
geometries. Further insights into the melting behavior of these clusters were
obtained from quench studies and by examining rms bond length fluctuations.
