  series, in press (2001)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present results of a high-resolution imaging survey of barred S0--Sa
galaxies which demonstrate that the central regions of these galaxies are
surprisingly complex. We see many inner bars --- small, secondary bars
(typically less than a kiloparsec in radius) located inside of, and probably
rotating faster than, the large primary bars. These are present in about one
quarter to one third of all our sample. In contrast to some theoretical
expectations, they do not seem to enhance AGN activity significantly. A third
of barred S0's appear to host kiloparsec-scale disks within their bars; but the
frequency of such inner disks is much lower in our S0/a and Sa galaxies. In
addition, we find one example of a triple barred galaxy, and two cases of
purely stellar nuclear rings --- probably the fossil remnants of past
circumnuclear starbursts.
  We comment briefly on results from an ongoing analysis of known double-barred
systems, extending to Hubble types as late as Sbc, and discuss their
characteristic sizes and orientations.

particular cosmological models with a quintessence field in the form of a

the evolution of peak luminosities of the supernovae sources which has been
recently discussed in the literature. We also show that the fiducial SNAP data

discriminate the PNGB model from a number of other spatially flat quintessence

entirely general and it applies to any collection of D-branes (of distinct
grades) wrapping the same special Lagrangian cycle, being valid in arbitrary

formalism, whose formulation involves the concept of {\em graded
supermanifolds}. We discuss this formalism in detail and explain why
$\Z$-graded supermanifolds are necessary for a correct geometric understanding
of BV systems. For the particular case of graded D-brane pairs, we also give a
direct construction of the master action, finding complete agreement with the

under certain topological assumptions,all states resulting from the
condensation process of a pair of branes with grades differing by one unit are
BRST trivial and thus the composite can be viewed as a closed string vacuum. We
prove that there are {\em six} types of pairs which must be viewed as generally
inequivalent. This contradicts the assumption that `brane-antibrane' systems
exhaust the nontrivial dynamics of topological A-branes with the same geometric
support.

the statistical physics of turbulent transport processes. We analyze here in
detail the time-dependent (non compact) linear operator that governs the
dynamics of correlation functions in the case of shell models of passive scalar
advection. The problem is generic in the sense that the driving velocity field
is neither Gaussian nor $\delta$-correlated in time. We show how to naturally
discuss the dynamics in terms of an effective compact operator that displays
""zero modes"" which determine the anomalous scaling of the correlation
functions. Since shell models have neither Lagrangian structure nor ""shape
dynamics"" this example differs significantly from standard passive scalar
advection. Nevertheless with the necessary modifications the generality and
efficacy of the concept of Statistically Preserved Structures are further
exemplified. In passing we point out a bonus of the present approach, in
providing analytic predictions for the time-dependent correlation functions in
decaying turbulent transport.

the quantum mechanical paradoxes are due to structural shortcomings of the
standard quantum theory, which means that our analysis agrees with the claim

the absence of hidden variables but to the impossibility for standard quantum
mechanics to describe separated quantum entities. Nonlocality appears as a
