departure from axisymmetric structure. We consider only departure along and
near the equatorial plane, i.e., between the two sides perpendicular to the
symmetry axis of the nebula. We consider 6 types of departure from axisymmetry:
(1) PNe whose central star is not at the center of the nebula; (2) PNe having
one side brighter than the other; (3) PNe having unequal size or shape of the
two sides; (4) PNe whose symmetry axis is bent, e.g., the two lobes in bipolar
PNe are bent toward the same side; (5) PNe whose main departure from
axisymmetry is in the outer regions, e.g., an outer arc; (6) PNe which show no
departure from axisymmetry, i.e., any departure, if it exists, is on scales
smaller than the scale of blobs, filaments, and other irregularities in the
nebula. We discuss the connection between departure types and the physical
mechanisms that may cause them, mainly due to the influence by a stellar binary
companion. We find that about 50 percents of all PNe possess large-scale
departure from axisymmetry. This number is larger than that expected from the
influence of binary companions, namely 25-30 percents. We argue that this
discrepancy comes from many PNe whose departure from axisymmetry, mainly
unequal size, shape, or intensity, results from the presence of long-lived and
large, hot or cool, spots on the surface of their AGB progenitors. Such spots
locally enhance mass loss rate, leading to a deparure from axisymmetry, mainly
near the equator, in the descendant PN.

that its red spectral energy distribution is caused by dust reddening local to
the quasar. FIRST J073820.1+275045 is thus one of the few low radio-luminosity,
highly dust-reddened quasars known. The available observational evidence for
FIRST J013435.7-093102 leads us to conclude that it too is reddened by dust. We
show that FIRST J013435.7-093102 is gravitationally lensed, increasing the
number of known lensed, extremely dust-reddened quasars to at least three,
including MG0414-0534 and PKS1830-211. We discuss the implications of whether
these objects are reddened by dust in the host or lensing galaxies. If reddened
by their local environment, then we estimate that between 10 and 20% of the
radio-loud quasar population is reddened by dust in the host galaxy. The
discovery of FIRST J073820.1+275045 and objects now emerging from X-ray surveys
suggests the existence of an analogous radio-quiet red quasar population. Such
objects will be entirely missed by standard radio or optical quasar surveys. If
dust in the lensing galaxies is primarily responsible for the extreme redness
of the lensed quasars, then an untold number of gravitationally lensed quasars
are being overlooked.

extragalactic sub-mm survey so far undertaken with the SCUBA camera on the
JCMT. Our maps cover 260 sq. arcmin, to a noise level S(850)=2.5 mJy/beam. We
have reduced the data using both SURF, and our own pipeline which produces
zero-footprint maps and noise images. The uncorrelated noise maps produced by
the latter approach have allowed application of a maximum-likelihood method to
measure the statistical significance of each peak, leading to properly
quantified flux-density errors for all potential sources. We detect 19 sources
with S/N > 4, 38 with S/N > 3.5, and 72 with S/N > 3. To assess completeness
and the impact of source confusion we have applied our source extraction
algorithm to a series of simulated images. The result is a new estimate of the
sub-mm source counts in the flux-density range S(850)=5-15mJy, which we compare
with other estimates, and with model predictions. Our estimate of the
cumulative source count at S(850) > 8 mJy is 320 (+80,-100) per square degree.
Assuming that the majority of sources have z > 1.5, the co-moving number
density of high-z galaxies forming stars at a rate >1000 solar masses per year
is 10^-5 per Mpc^3, with only a weak dependence on the precise redshift
distribution. This number density corresponds to that of massive ellipticals
with L > 3-4 L* at low redshift and is also the same as the co-moving number
density of comparably massive, passively-evolving objects in the redshift band
1<z<2 inferred from recent surveys of extremely red objects. Thus the bright
sub-mm sources can plausibly account for the formation of all present-day
massive ellipticals. Improved z constraints, and a proper measurement of sub-mm
clustering can refine or refute this picture.

Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at z~3, obtained from the variance of galaxy counts
in 2-dimensional cells. By avoiding binning of the angular separations, this
method is significantly less affected by shot noise than traditional measures,
and allows for a more accurate determination of the correlation function. We
used a sample of about 1,000 galaxies with R<=25.5 extracted from the survey by
Steidel and collaborators, and found the following results. At scales in the
range 30<~theta<~100 arcsec, the angular correlation function w(theta) can be
accurately described as a power law with slope beta=0.50 +0.25-0.50(1 sigma
random)-0.10(systematic), shallower than the measure presented by Giavalisco et
al. However, the spatial correlation length, derived by Limber deprojection, is
in very good agreement with the previous measures, confirming the strong
spatial clustering of these sources. We discuss in detail the effects of both
random and systematic errors, in particular of the so called ``integral
constraint'' bias, to which we set a lower limit using numerical simulations.
This suggests that the current samples do not yet provide a ``fair
representation'' of the large-scale distribution of LBGs at z~3. An intriguing
result of our analysis is that at angular separations smaller than theta<~30
arcsec the correlation function seems to depart from the power-law fitted at
larger scales and become smaller. This feature is detected at the ~90 per cent
confidence level and, if real, it can provide information on the number density
and spatial distribution of LBGs within their host halos as well as the size
and the mass of the halos.

parameters show that the HI density in the local Universe is more widely spread
over galaxies of different size, central surface brightness, and luminosity
than is the optical luminosity density. The number density of very low surface
brightness (>24.0 mag/arcsec^2) gas-rich galaxies is considerably lower than
that found in optical surveys designed to detect dim galaxies. This suggests
that only a part of the population of LSB galaxies is gas rich and that the
rest must be gas poor. However, we show that this gas-poor population must be
cosmologically insignificant in baryon content. The contribution of gas-rich
LSB galaxies (>23.0 mag/arcsec^2) to the local cosmological gas and luminosity
density is modest (18_{-5}^{+6} and 5_{-2}^{+2} per cent respectively); their

The FUV images were obtained by the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UIT) and the
H-alpha images were obtained using various ground-based telescopes. In all of
the galaxies, the F_H-alpha/F_UIT flux ratio is lower in the DIG than in the
HII regions. This is likely an indication that the mean spectral type for OB
stars in the field is later than that in HII regions. Comparison of the
N_Lyc/L_UIT ratio with models of evolving stellar populations shows that the
stellar population in the DIG is consistent with either an older single burst
population or a steady state model with constant star formation and an initial
mass function (IMF) slope steeper than alpha=2.35. We compared the
F_H\alpha/F_UIT ratio in the DIG of these galaxies with that in M33. If the
mean spectral types of stars in HII regions and in the DIG are the same as in
M33, and the difference in extinction between DIG and HII regions is constant

sources of ionization in most galaxies, and may be the dominant source in some

to host obscured AGN activity at z= 1-3. From these results we calculate that a
significant fraction (approx 5-45%) could be obscured QSOs at z<=3. Given the
number of X-ray sources without I-band counterparts, there are unlikely to be
more than approx 15 sources at z>6. We provide evidence that the true number of

micro-Jy radio counterparts; approx 53% of the optically faint micro-Jy radio
sources in this region. The most likely origin of the X-ray emission in these
X-ray detected, optically faint micro-Jy radio sources is obscured AGN
activity. However, two of these sources have been previously detected at
sub-millimeter wavelengths and the X-ray emission from these sources could be
due to luminous star formation activity. Assuming the SED of NGC 6240, we
estimate the 175 micron flux of a typical optically faint X-ray source to be
<10 mJy. As expected for sources with AGN activity, the two optically faint

effects of reddening and extinction. Using the photometric catalogue of the ESO

brighter than K=19.5. We have obtained spectra of 33 candidates, using the

three are confirmed as QSOs. Identification of the 22 redder candidates with
V-J>3 is substantially incomplete, but so far no reddened QSOs have been found.
Near-infrared spectroscopy will be more effective in identifying some of these
targets. Only two UVX (U-B<-0.2) sources brighter than K=19.5 are found which
are not also KX selected. These are both identified as galactic stars. Thus KX
selection appears to select all UVX QSOs. The surface density of QSOs in the

identification of the red subsample (V-J>3) is substantially incomplete, the

anticipated, at these faint magnitudes the KX sample includes several compact

regions in the universe can in fact be protected by their own gravity to form
mini-universes, provided that their present matter densities exceed some
critical value. In the case with cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM cosmology)
the condition of forming mini-universe is that the ratio of present density
parameters $\Omega_{i}^0/\Omega_\Lambda$ ought to be larger than a critical
value 3.63. Such mini-universes typically weigh less than $2\times 10^{14}$
solar masses, with the lighter ones having tight and compact configurations. In
the case with quintessence, the final ratio $\Omega_i/\Omega_q$ of a
mini-universe is found to be always larger than $w_q^2-w_q$, where $w_q$ is the
equation of state parameter.

white dwarfs can be derived from a population of binaries residing initially
within the thin disk of the Galaxy. In particular we consider binaries where
the primary is sufficiently massive to explode as a type II supernova. A large
fraction of such binaries are broken up when the primary then explodes as a
supernova owing to the combined effects of the mass loss from the primary and
the kick received by the neutron star on its formation. For binaries where the
primary evolves to fill its Roche lobe, mass transfer from the primary leads to
the onset of a common envelope phase during which the secondary and the core of
the primary spiral together as the envelope is ejected. Such binaries are the
progenitors of X-ray binaries if they are not broken up when the primary
explodes. For those systems which are broken up, a large number of the
secondaries receive kick velocities ~100 - 200 km/s and subsequently evolve
into white dwarfs. We compute trajectories within the Galactic potential for
this population of stars and relate the birthrate of these stars over the
entire Galaxy to those seen locally with high velocities relative to the LSR.
We show that for a reasonable set of assumptions concerning the Galactic
supernova rate and the binary population, our model produces a local number
density of high-velocity white dwarfs compatible with that inferred from
observations. We therefore propose that a population of white dwarfs
originating in the thin disk may make a significant contribution to the
observed population of high-velocity white dwarfs.

electron-phonon coupling is used for calculation of the energies of thermal
dissociation, photoionization (optically induced release of an electron (hole)
from the ground self-consistent state), as well as optical absorption to the
non-relaxed excited states. Unlike the case of free strong-coupling polarons,
where the ratio \kappa of the photoionization energy to the thermal
dissociation energy was shown to be always equal to 3, here this ratio depends
on the Froehlich coupling constant \alpha and the screened Coulomb interaction
strength \beta. Reasonable variation of these two parameters has demonstrated
that the magnitude of \kappa remains usually in the narrow interval from 1 to
2.5. This is in agreement with atomistic calculations and experimental data for
hole O^- polarons bound to the cation vacancy in MgO. The thermal dissociation
energy for the ground self-consistent state and the energy of the optically
induced charge transfer process (hops of a hole between O^{2-} ions) have been

are compatible with two competing order parameters that form on disjunct

$\alpha (T)$ anomalies that can be identified with a kinetic, glass-like

In particular, those effects result in a non-monotonous behaviour of the

omega omega_0 associated with the low-energy localized excitations. These
anomalies lead to a substantial enhancement of the magnetic specific heat, C_M,
at low temperatures. Although the dynamical properties are significantly
modified we show that 2D is not the lower critical dimension for this problem.

Monte Carlo simulations in two dimensions. The Potts spins mimic orientational
degrees of freedom and the coupled frustrated Ising spins take into account for
frustrating effects like the geometrical hindrance. We show that in this model
dynamical transitions and crossovers are related to static transitions. In
particular, when disorder is present, as predicted and verified in SG, a
dynamical transition between high-temperatures exponential to low-temperatures
non-exponential correlation functions numerically coincides with the ordering
temperature of the ferromagnetic regions, i.e. the Griffiths temperature
$T_c(s)$, while a crossover between power law growth of correlation times to
Arrhenius law occurs near a Potts transition at $T_p(s)<T_c(s)$. In the model
without disorder, where $T_c(s)$ is not defined, both dynamical transition and
crossover occur at $T_p(s)$. Furthermore the static susceptibility and the

(1962) and Lynden-Bell & Wood (1968) on the basis of the maximum entropy
principle for the phase-space distribution function. In contrast to previous
analyses using the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy, we apply the Tsallis-type
generalized entropy to seek the equilibrium criteria. Then the distribution
function of Vlassov-Poisson system can be reduced to the stellar polytrope
system. Evaluating the second variation of Tsallis entropy and solving the zero
eigenvalue problem explicitly, we find that the gravothermal instability
appears in cases with polytrope index $n>5$. The critical point characterizing
the onset of instability are obtained, which exactly matches with the results
derived from the standard turning-point analysis. The results give an important
suggestion that the Tsallis entropy is indeed applicable and viable to the

for the large value of the parameter no oscillations at all for the survival

consistent with all experimental tests of general relativity. Specifically, we
examine the so-called gravitomagnetic effect in the context of the
Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. This treatment, of course, assumes the recovery of
the Kerr metric in brane-worlds which we have found to the first order in the
ratio of the brane separation to the radius of the AdS$_5$, $(\ell/r)$. We
first show that the second Randall-Sundrum model of one brane leaves the
gravitomagnetic effect unchanged. Then, we consider the two-brane scenario of
the original Randall-Sundrum proposal and show that the magnitude of the
gravitomagnetic effect depends heavily on the ratio of $(\ell/r)$. Such
dependence is a result of the geometrodynamic spacetime and does not appear in
static scenarios. We hope that we will be able to test this proposal

manifested in excited bands, are pointed out.

investigated within the framework of coupled Ginzburg-Landau equations. The
equations are in particular relevant for non-Boussinesq Rayleigh-B\'enard
convection at low Prandtl numbers. The mean flow is found to (1) affect only
one of the two long-wave phase modes of the hexagons and (2) suppress the
mixing between the two phase modes. As a consequence, for small Prandtl numbers
the transverse and the longitudinal phase instability occur in sufficiently
distinct parameter regimes that they can be studied separately. Through the
formation of penta-hepta defects, they lead to different types of transient
disordered states. The results for the dynamics of the penta-hepta defects shed
light on the persistence of grain boundaries in such disordered states.

values to quantities in quantum theory. In those papers, the main idea was to
assign a sieve as a partial and contextual truth value to a proposition that
the value of a quantity lies in a certain set $\Delta \subseteq \mathR$. Here
we relate such sieve-valued valuations to valuations that assign to quantities
subsets, rather than single elements, of their spectra (we call these
`interval' valuations). There are two main results. First, there is a natural
correspondence between these two kinds of valuation, which uses the notion of a
state's support for a quantity (Section 3). Second, if one starts with a more
general notion of interval valuation, one sees that our interval valuations
based on the notion of support (and correspondingly, our sieve-valued
valuations) are a simple way to secure certain natural properties of
valuations, such as monotonicity (Section 4).
