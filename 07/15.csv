$\sim $10) covering the range 3650---7400\AA for 3149 galaxies with median
redshift 0.05. The sample is 90% complete to $R=15.4$. The median slit covering
fraction is 24% of the galaxy, apparently sufficient to minimize the effects of
aperture bias on the EW(H$\alpha$).
  Forty-nine percent of the galaxes in the survey have one or more emission
lines detected at $\geq 2 \sigma$. In agreement with previous surveys, the
fraction of absorption-line galaxies increases steeply with galaxy luminosity.
  We use H$\beta$, O[III], H$\alpha$, and [N\II] to discriminate between
star-forming galaxies and AGNs.
  We use the EW(H$\alpha$ + [N\II]) to estimate the Scalo birthrate parameter,
$b$, the ratio of the current star formation rate to the time averaged star
formation rate.
  Finally, we examine the way galaxies of different spectroscopic type trace
the large-scale galaxy distribution.

neutrinos from supernova SN 1987A detected by the Kamiokande II, IMB, and
Baksan detectors, and find strong evidence for two components in the neutrino
signal: a long time scale component from thermal Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling of
the nascent neutron star, and a brief (~< 1 s), softer component similar to
that expected from emission by accreting material in the delayed supernova
scenario. In the context of this model, we show that the data constrain the
electron antineutrino rest mass to be less than 5.7 eV with 95% probability.
Our analysis takes advantage of significant advances that have occured in the
years since the detections in both our understanding of the supernova mechanism
and our ability to analyze sparse data. As a result there are substantial
differences between our inferences and those found in earlier studies. We find
that two-component models for the neutrino signal make the data >100 times more
probable than single-component models. In addition, the radius and binding
energy of the nascent neutron star implied by single-component models deviates
significantly from the values predicted by current neutron star models, whereas
those implied by models with an accretion component are in complete agreement
with the predictions. As a result, two-component models are hundreds to
thousands of times more probable than single-component models. The neutrino
data thus provide the first direct observational evidence in favor of the
delayed supernova scenario over the prompt scenario. (Abridged abstract)

understand the origin of the precipitous slowing down of dynamics observed in

Carlo simulations and exact calculations indicates that this model exhibits an
entropy vanishing transition accompanied by a rapid divergence of time scales.
Measurements of various correlation functions show that the system displays a
hierarchy of time scales associated with different degrees of freedom. Extended
structures, arising from the frustration in the system, are identified as the
source of the slow dynamics. In the simulations, the system falls out of
equilibrium at a temperature $T_{g}$ higher than the entropy-vanishing
transition temperature and the dynamics below $T_{g}$ exhibits aging as
distinct from coarsening. The cooling rate dependence of the energy is also
consistent with the usual glass formation scenario.

of selecting a subset of the memory base is employed to reduce the number of

blue tilt. In the latter case, we find that the back-reaction effect of
fluctuations whose present wavelength is smaller than the Hubble radius but
which are stretched beyond the Hubble radius by the accelerated expansion
during the era of Quintessence domination can become large. Since the
back-reaction effects of these modes oppose the acceleration, back-reaction
will lead to a truncation of the period of Quintessence domination. This result
impacts on the recent discussions of the potential incompatibility between
