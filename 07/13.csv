distinct nuclear disks such as those in NGC 4486A but also some of the disky

of stellar orbits in phase space and would tend to make an elliptical galaxy
evolve toward a more nearly axisymmetric shape.

satellites suffer an orbital decay due to hydrodynamical interaction with the
disc medium (transitions across the disc, gap opening in the disc, density
waves) and gravitational radiation. Arbitrary orbital eccentricities and
inclinations are considered, and it is observed how the competing effects
depend on the parameters of the model, namely, the mass and compactness of the
orbiters, the osculating elements of their trajectories, and surface density of
the disc. These effects have a visible impact on the satellites long-term
motion, and they can produce observational consequences with respect to
galactic central clusters. It is shown that the satellite-disc collisions do
not impose serious restrictions on the results of gravitational wave
experiments if the disc medium is diluted and the orbiter is compact but they
are important in the case of environments with relatively high density. We thus
concentrate on application to accretion flows in which the density is not
negligible. We discuss the expected quasi-stationary structure of the cluster

influence of the central object. Relevant to this region, we give the power-law
slopes defining the radial profile of modified clusters and we show that their

  The median H-beta and [O III] emission-line equivalent widths of the red

sub-sample. Both the colours and the emission-line equivalent widths of the red
quasars can be explained by the addition of a featureless red synchrotron
continuum component to an otherwise normal blue quasar spectrum. The relative
strengths of the blue and red components span two orders of magnitude at
rest-frame 500nm. The blue component is weaker relative to the red component in
low optical luminosity sources. This suggests that the fraction of accretion
energy going into optical emission from the jet is greater in low luminosity
quasars.
  This synchrotron model does not, however, fit around 10% of the quasars,

hr. The variation was accompanied by only minor (if any) changes in the emitted
spectrum and pulse fraction. On the contrary an observation near apastron
detected the source in a nearly constant state at a level of ~2x10^33 erg/s.
Direct accretion onto the neutron star surface encounters major difficulties in
explaining the source variability properties. When the different regimes
expected for a rotating magnetic neutron star subject to a variable inflow of
matter from its companion are taken into consideration, the results of BeppoSAX
observations of 4U 0115+63 can be explained naturally. In particular close to
apastron, the regime of centrifugal inhibition of accretion applies, whereas
the dramatic source flux variability observed close to periastron is readily
interpreted as the transition regime between direct neutron star accretion and
the propeller regime. In this centrifugal transition regime small variations of
the mass inflow rate give rise to very large luminosity variations. We present
a simple model for this transition, which we successfully apply to the X-ray

Accepted for publication in ApJ","Astrophys.J.561:708-726,2001","10.1086/323368",,"astro-ph",,"  We investigate the role of ram pressure stripping in the Virgo cluster using
N-body simulations. Radial orbits within the Virgo cluster's gravitational
potential are modeled and analyzed with respect to ram pressure stripping. The
N-body model consists of 10000 gas cloud complexes which can have inelastic
collisions. Ram pressure is modeled as an additional acceleration on the clouds
located at the surface of the gas distribution in the direction of the galaxy's
motion within the cluster. We made several simulations changing the orbital
parameters in order to recover different stripping scenarios using realistic
temporal ram pressure profiles. We investigate systematically the influence of
the inclination angle between the disk and the orbital plane of the galaxy on
the gas dynamics. We show that ram pressure can lead to a temporary increase of
the central gas surface density. In some cases a considerable part of the total
atomic gas mass (several 10^8 M_solar) can fall back onto the galactic disk
after the stripping event. A quantitative relation between the orbit parameters
and the resulting HI deficiency is derived containing explicitly the
inclination angle between the disk and the orbital plane. The comparison
between existing HI observations and the results of our simulations shows that

reflecting the spiral arms in the stellar mass, while the halo was modelled as

then compared to the observed stellar spiral arm morphology and to the H-alpha

multiplicity of energy scales which characterize superconductivity in the
underdoped cuprates. In contrast to the situation in BCS superconductors, the
phase coherence temperature Tc is different from the energy gap onset
temperature T*. In addition, thermodynamic and tunneling spectroscopies have
led to the inference that the order parameter $\Delta_{sc}$ is to be
distinguished from the excitation gap $\Delta$; in this way, pseudogap effects
persist below Tc. It has been argued by many in the community that the presence
of these distinct energy scales demonstrates that the pseudogap is unrelated to
superconductivity. In this paper we show that this inference is incorrect. We
demonstrate that the difference between the order parameter and excitation gap
and the contrasting dependences of T* and Tc on hole concentration $x$ and

simple generalized form is based on a BCS-like ground state, but with self
consistently determined chemical potential in the presence of arbitrary
attractive coupling $g$. We have applied this mean field theory with some
success to tunneling, transport, thermodynamics and magnetic field effects. We

background. The string is relatively highly mobile, because the motion of a

the hole at the other end of the line follows along the same track. Appropriate
coherent combinations of string states realize some irreducible representations
of the point group C_4v. Creep of strings favors d- and p-wave states. Some
more subtle processes decide the symmetry of pairing. The pattern of the
current correlation function, that defines the structure of flux, emerges from
motion of holes at string ends and coherence factors with which string states
appear in the wave function of the bound state. Condensation of bipolarons and

approach to many-body systems. The present theory incorporates the
Mott-Hubbard, Brinkman-Rice and Slater pictures of the MIT into a unified
framework, together with reproducing low-energy narrow band arising from
spin-charge fluctuations. At half filling, single-particle spectra $A(\omega,
k)$ show formation of two Hubbard bands and their antiferromagnetic shadows
separated by a Mott gap in the plane of energy $\omega$ and momentum $k$ with
lowering temperatures. These four bands produce splitting to two low-energy
narrow bands and two SDW-like bands in the dispersion. Near half filling, the
low-energy narrow band persists at low temperatures. This narrow band has a
particularly weak dispersion and large weights around $(\pi, 0)$ and $(0, \pi)$
momenta. The velocity of these low-energy excitations is shown to vanish
towards the MIT, indicating the mass divergence as in the Brinkman-Rice
picture, but most prominently around $(\pi,0)$ and $(0,\pi)$ with strong
momentum dependence. This reflects the suppression of the coherence near the
MIT. Main structures in $A(\omega, k)$ show remarkable similarities to quantum
Monte-Carlo results in two dimensions as well as in the one-dimensional Hubbard
model. The charge compressibility appears to diverge with decreasing doping
concentration in both one and two dimensions in agreement with the exact and
quantum Monte-Carlo results. We also discuss implications of the flat
dispersion formed near the Fermi level to the observations in high-$\Tc$
cuprate superconductors.

obtain a Curie-Weiss susceptibility $\chi(T) \sim C / (\Theta+T)$ as expected
for antiferromagnetic correlations but we do not obtain a direct signature of
antiferromagnetic long range order. We explain how to obtain the ``impurity''
susceptibility $\chi_{imp}(T)$ by subtracting the Haldane gap contribution to
the total susceptibility. In the temperature range [1 K, 300 K] the
experimental data are well fitted by $T \chi_{imp}(T) = C_{imp} (1 + T_{imp}/T
)^{-\gamma}$. In the temperature range [100 mK, 1 K] the experimental data are
well fitted by $T \chi_{imp}(T) = A \ln{(T/T_c)}$, where $T_c$ increases with
$x$. This fit suggests the existence of a finite N\'eel temperature which is
however too small to be probed directly in our experiments. We also obtain a
maximum in the temperature dependence of the ac-susceptibility $\chi'(T)$ which

one-electron $\sigma$ bonding is suggested. The covalent one-electron $\sigma$
bonding gives rise to a strongly correlated state of electrons resulting from
the exchange interaction between electrons when they are simultaneously at
cation and anion orbitals. The manifestation of the correlatred state is the
spin and spatial ordering of the electrons resulting in the formation of a
spin- ordered electron lattice. The conductivity of manganites in this model is
the consequence of displacement of the electron lattice (or its part) from one
localization site to another and depends on the type of spin ordering of the
electrons in the electron lattice and the localization energy determined by the
energy of the one-electron $\sigma$ bond. The model also assumes a strong
polarization of an anion by cations, which facilitates the 3s2p hybridization
of the anion and transition of one of the pairs of 2p electrons from the
singlet state into the triplet state. This transition leads to formation of the
spin-polarized electron lattice (electron spins are parallel) and ferromagnetic
ordering of manganese ions. In the model, the effect of colossal
magnetoresistance is explained by a change of the conductivity mechanism on
application of an external magnetic field, i.e., transition from the
conductivity mechnism typical of an ionic crystal to the conductivity provided
by the spin-polarized electron lattice.

The Einstein equations and the hydrodynamical equations are perturbed and

the energy spectra computed by the quadrupole formalism which assumes that both
masses are pointlike, and accounts only for the radiation emitted because the
orbital motion produces a time dependent quadrupole moment. The results of our
perturbative approach show that, in general, the quadrupole formalism
overestimates the amount of emitted radiation, especially when the two masses
are close. However, if the pointlike mass is allowed to move on an orbit so
tight that the keplerian orbital frequency resonates with the frequency of the
fundamental quasi-normal mode of the star (2w_K=w_f), this mode can be excited
and the emitted radiation can be considerably larger than that computed by the
quadrupole approach.

adjoint representation can be constructed on the lattice with manifest
star-gauge invariance in arbitrary even dimensions. Chiral fermions are
implemented using a Dirac operator which satisfies the Ginsparg-Wilson
relation. A gauge-invariant integration measure for the fermion fields can be
given explicitly, which simplifies the construction as compared with lattice
chiral gauge theories in ordinary (commutative) space-time. Our construction
includes the cases where continuum calculations yield a gauge anomaly. This
reveals a certain regularization dependence, which is reminiscent of parity
anomaly in commutative space-time with odd dimensions. We speculate that the
gauge anomaly obtained in the continuum calculations in the present cases can
be cancelled by an appropriate counterterm.

faithfully on $F$ and $C$, and $\sigma$ is induced by the automorphism
$\tau\times Id$ of $F\times C$, $\tau$ being the hyperelliptic involution of
$F$. We describe all the $F$, $C$ and $G$ that occur: in this way we obtain 5
families of surfaces with $p_g=0$ and $K^2=8$, of which we believe only one was
previously known.
  Using our classification we are able to give an alternative description of
these surfaces as double covers of the plane, thus recovering a construction
proposed by Du Val. In addition we study the geometry of the subset of the
moduli space of surfaces of general type with $p_g=0$ and $K^2=8$ that admit a
double plane structure.

show that for each allowed value of these invariants, which are bounded by a

Interpreting the moduli space of representations as a moduli space of Higgs

function on the Higgs moduli space. A key step is the identification of the

does not allow coherent states to form. As gravitation can only emerge from
coherent modes, it can no longer be transitive. Matter in high densities would
thus tend to increase its disorder, decouple from its own gravity, from the
