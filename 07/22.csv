ground-based instrument designed to study astrophysical sources of gamma
radiation in the energy range of 50 to 500 GeV. STACEE uses an array of large
heliostat mirrors at the National Solar Thermal Test Facility in Albuquerque,
New Mexico, USA. The heliostats are used to collect Cherenkov light produced in
gamma-ray air showers. The light is concentrated onto an array of
photomultiplier tubes located near the top of a tower. The construction of
STACEE started in 1997 and has been completed in 2001. During the 1998-99
observing season, we used a portion of the experiment, STACEE-32, to detect
gamma-rays from the Crab Nebula. The completed version of STACEE uses 64
heliostat mirrors, having a total collection area of 2300 m^2. During the last
year, we have also installed custom electronics for pulse delay and triggering,
and 1 GHz Flash ADCs to read out the photomultiplier tubes. The commissioning
of the full STACEE instrument is underway. Preliminary observations and
simulation work indicate that STACEE will have an energy threshold below 70 GeV
and a reach for extragalactic gamma-ray sources out to redshift of ~1.0. In
this paper we describe the design and performance of STACEE.

vortex lattice and highly disordered vortex glass, as well as on the maximum
critical current density within the glass phase, jcmax. When 32% of Ba is
replaced by Sr, jcmax is an order of magnitude higher than in the unsubstituted
compound. In contrast, the transition field Hss first drops by a factor of
about five with a substitution of just 10% of Sr for Ba, and then remains
approximately constant for higher Sr contents. Our results indicate that in
very clean systems the order-disorder transition is affected very strongly by
any crystallographic disorder, while above a certain threshold it is relatively
robust with respect to additional disorder. In all substituted crystals Hss
monotonically decreases with an increase of temperature.

amplitude, the phase diagram of the system contains regions of the usual
one-particle Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). However for $V>2t$ we have total
phase separation on a Mott-Hubbard Bose solid and a dilute Bose gas. For two
sorts of structureless bosons described by the two band Hubbard model an s-wave
pairing of the two bosons of different sort $<b_1 b_2 > \neq 0$ is possible.
The results we obtained should be important for different Bose systems,
including submonolayers of $^4$He, excitons in semiconductors, Schwinger bosons
in magnetic systems and holons in HTSC. In the HTSC case a possibility of
two-holon pairing in the slave-bosons theories of superconductivity can restore
