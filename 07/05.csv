the application of advanced statistical methods to these observational
time-series reveals important contrasts in the nature and scaling properties of
the transport processes operating within these sources. We find the Crab signal
resembles Gaussian noise; the Cygnus X-1 signal is a leptokurtic random walk
whose self-similar properties persist on timescales up to three years; and the
GRS1915+105 signal is similar to that from Cygnus X-1, but with self-similarity
extending possibly to only a few days. This evidence of self-similarity
provides a robust quantitative characterisation of anomalous transport occuring
within the systems.

to the surrounding wind nebula occurs on a timescale of less than 1000 years;
during this time, the nebula expands into freely expanding supernova ejecta. On
a timescale 10,000 years, the interaction of the supernova with the surrounding
medium drives a reverse shock front toward the center of the remnant, where it
crushes the PWN (pulsar wind nebula). One- and two-dimensional, two-fluid
simulations of the crushing and re-expansion phases of a PWN show that (1)
these phases are subject to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities that result in the
mixing of thermal and nonthermal fluids, and (2) asymmetries in the surrounding
interstellar medium give rise to asymmetries in the position of the PWN
relative to the pulsar and explosion site. These effects are expected to be
observable in the radio emission from evolved PWN because of the long lifetimes
of radio emitting electrons. The scenario can explain the chaotic and
asymmetric appearance of the Vela X PWN relative to the Vela pulsar without
recourse to a directed flow from the vicinity of the pulsar. The displacement
of the radio nebulae in G327.1--1.1, MSH15--56 (G326.3--1.8), G0.9+0.1, and W44
relative to the X-ray nebulae may be due to this mechanism. On timescales much
greater than the nebular crushing time, the initial PWN may be mixed with
thermal gas and become unobservable, so that even the radio emission is
dominated by recently injected particles.

previous metallicity distributions, selected on the basis of spectral type, are
biased against stars with solar metallicity or higher. A selection of G-dwarf
stars is inherently biased against metal rich stars and is not representative
of the solar neighbourhood metallicity distribution. Using a sample selected on
colour, we obtain a distribution where approximately half the stars in the
solar neighbourhood has a metallicity higher than [Fe/H]=0. The percentage of
mid-metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]$<$-0.5) is approximately 4 per cent, in agreement
with present estimates of the thick disc. In order to have a metallicity
distribution comparable to chemical evolution model predictions, we convert the
star fraction to mass fraction, and show that another bias against metal-rich
stars affects dwarf metallicity distributions, due to the colour (or spectral
type) limits of the samples. Reconsidering the corrections due to the
increasing thickness of the stellar disc with age, we show that the Simple
Closed-Box model with no instantaneous recycling approximation gives a
reasonable fit to the observed distribution. Comparisons with the

(~disk cut-off radius) and short (~z0) scales, with amplitudes of the order of
280pc and 130pc on average, respectively. The size of these large (short)
-scale instabilities corresponds to 14% (6%) of the mean disk scale height.
This is a factor of 2 (1.5) larger than the value found for non-interacting
galaxies. A hallmark of nearly all tidally distorted disks is a scale height
that increases systematically with radial distance. The frequent occurrence and
the significantly larger size of these gradients indicate that disk asymmetries
on large scales are a common and persistent phenomenon, while local
disturbances and bending instabilities decline on shorter timescales. Nearly
all (93%) of the interacting/merging and 45% of the non-interacting galaxies
studied are noticeably warped. Warps of interacting/merging galaxies are ~2.5
times larger on average than those observed in the non-interacting sample, with
sizes of the order of 340pc and 140pc, respectively. This indicates that tidal
distortions do considerably contribute to the formation and size of warps.
However, they cannot entirely explain the frequent occurrence of warped disks.

GCs compared to other well-studied spirals. Because the Sombrero is dominated
by a huge bulge and only has a modest disk, we associate the two
sub-populations with the halo and bulge components respectively. Thus our
analysis supports the view that the metal-rich GCs in spirals are associated
with the bulge rather than with the disk. The Sombrero GCs have typical
effective (half-light) radii of about 2 pc with the red ones being about 30%
smaller than the blue ones. We identify many similarities between the

field can be described by discrete variables, which are given by assignment of
the number density and velocity into the DWT modes. These DWT variables are
complete and not redundant. In this scheme, the peculiar velocity and pairwise
velocity of galaxies or particles are given by field variables. As a
consequence, the velocity dispersion (VD) and pairwise velocity dispersion
(PVD) are no longer measured by number-counting or pair-counting statistic, but
with the ensemble of the field variables, and therefore, they are free from the
bias due to the number-counting and pair-counting. We analyzed the VD and PVD
of the velocity fields given by the N-body simulation for models of the SCDM,
$\tau$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM. The spectrum (scale-dependence) of the VD and PVD
show that the length scale of the two-point correlation of the velocity field
is as large as few tens h$^{-1}$ Mpc. Although the VD and PVD show similar
behavior in some aspects, they are substantially different from each other. The
VD-to-PVD ratio shows the difference between the scale-dependencies of the VD

lognormal, i.e. of long tail. This difference indicates that the cosmic

measurements with interferometers. Based on the shapelet formalism presented in
Refregier (2001), object images are decomposed into orthonormal Hermite basis
functions. The shapelet coefficients of a collection of sources are
simultaneously fit on the uv plane, the Fourier transform of the sky brightness
distribution observed by interferometers. The resulting chi-square fit is
linear in its parameters and can thus be performed efficiently by simple matrix
multiplications. We show how the complex effects of bandwidth smearing, time
averaging and non-coplanarity of the array can be easily and fully corrected
for in our method. Optimal image reconstruction, co-addition, astrometry, and
photometry can all be achieved using weighted sums of the derived coefficients.
As an example we consider the observing conditions of the FIRST radio survey
(Becker et al. 1995; White et al. 1997). We find that our method accurately
recovers the shapes of simulated images even for the sparse uv sampling of this
snapshot survey. Using one of the FIRST pointings, we find our method compares
well with CLEAN, the commonly used method for interferometric imaging. Our
method has the advantage of being linear in the fit parameters, of fitting all
sources simultaneously, and of providing the full covariance matrix of the
coefficients, which allows us to quantify the errors and cross-talk in image
shapes. It is therefore well-suited for quantitative shape measurements which
require high-precision. In particular, we show how our method can be combined
with the results of Refregier & Bacon (2001) to provide an accurate measurement
of weak lensing from interferometric data.

flow, and the disk-corona model by Kawaguchi et al., which can nicely reproduce
the observed quasar spectra. The calculated microlens light curves of the
disk-corona model exhibit rapid soft X-ray and slow hard X-ray variations. This
is because the former is generated by Compton up-scattering of soft (optical --
UV) photons from the innermost part of the disk body, while the latter is
emitted via bremsstrahlung within the corona at relatively large radii.
Furthermore, an inhomogeneous emissivity distribution over the disk produces
humps in the microlens light curves because of enhanced microlens amplification
of the bright areas. It is hoped that black-hole accretion theory coupled with
future multi-wavelength microlens observations will be able to reveal such
spatial and temporal behaviors of flows in the vicinity of black holes.

southwest of the 22 GHz continuum peak. The blueshifted emission was found to
originate in two clusters that are separated by 0.7 milliarcsecond (0.16 pc).
No compact continuum emission was found within 3.6 pc of the maser spot. A
compact continuum source showing a marginally inverted spectrum between 1.7 and
5.0 GHz was found 4.2 pc southwest of the maser position. The spectral turnover
might be due to synchrotron self-absorption caused by a shock in the jet owing
to collision with dense gas, or it might be due to free-free absorption in an
ionized screen possibly the inner part of a disk, foreground to the jet.
  The water maser may be part of a maser disk. If so, it would be rotating in
the opposite sense to the highly inclined galactic disk observed in CO
emission. We estimate a binding mass within 1 pc of the presumed nucleus to be
on the order of 10^7 Msun. Alternatively, the maser emission could result from
the amplification of a radio jet by foreground circumnuclear molecular gas. In
this case, the high blueshift of the maser emission might mean that the masing
region is moving outward away from the molecular gas surrounding an active

mass X-ray binary LSI+61303, carried out with the European VLBI Network (EVN).
Over the 11 hour observing run, performed 10 days after a radio outburst, the
radio source showed a constant flux density, which allowed sensitive imaging of
the emission distribution. The structure in the map shows a clear extension to
the southeast. Comparing our data with previous VLBI observations we interpret
the extension as a collimated radio jet as found in several other X-ray
binaries. Assuming that the structure is the result of an expansion that
started at the onset of the outburst, we derive an apparent expansion velocity
of 0.003 c, which, in the context of Doppler boosting, corresponds to an
intrinsic velocity of at least 0.4 c for an ejection close to the line of
sight. From the apparent velocity in all available epochs we are able to
establish variations in the ejection angle which imply a precessing accretion
disk. Finally we point out that LSI+61303, like SS433 and Cygnus X-1, shows
evidence for an emission region almost orthogonal to the relativistic jet.

metal-free protostellar clouds is investigated within a spherically symmetric
hydrodynamical scheme that includes the transfer of radiation and the chemistry
of the primordial gas. The cloud centre collapses on a time scale of about
10^5-10^6 years, thanks to line cooling from molecular hydrogen (H2). For most
of the collapse time, when the evolution proceeds self-similarly, the
luminosity slowly rises up to about 10^36 erg/s and is essentially due to H2 IR
line emission. Later, continuum IR radiation provides an additional
contribution, which is mostly due to the accretion of an infalling envelope
upon a small hydrostatic protostellar core which develops in the centre. We
follow the beginning of the accretion phase, when the enormous accretion rate
(~ 0.1 Msun/yr) produces a very high continuum luminosity of about 10^36 erg/s.
Despite the high luminosities, the radiation field is unable to affect the gas
dynamics during the collapse and the first phases of accretion, because the
opacity of the infalling gas is too small; this is quite different from
present-day star formation. We also find that the protostellar evolution is
similar among clouds with different initial configurations, including those
resulting from 3D cosmological simulations of primordial objects; in
particular, the shape of the molecular spectra is quite universal. Finally, we
briefly discuss the detectability of this pristine cosmic star formation
activity.

lower metallicity than the similarly-aged Pleiades. We select a preliminary
catalogue of 1254 low mass (between 0.2 and 2.0M_{sun}) cluster candidates, of
which about 70--80 percent are expected to be genuine. The mass function is
metallicity dependent, but consistent with a Salpeter-like law (dN/dlog M ~
M^{-alpha}, alpha=+1.47+/-0.11 or alpha=+1.67+/-0.11 for solar and half-solar
metallicities) between 0.7 and 3.0M_{sun}. At lower masses (between 0.3 and

inconsistent with the much flatter mass functions seen in the Pleiades and
field populations. We explain this by demonstrating that mass segregation has
been at work in NGC 2516 -- more than half the cluster low mass stars are
expected to lie outside out survey. The mass of NGC 2516 stars with mass
greater than 0.3M_{sun} inside our survey is 950-1200M_{sun}, depending on
metallicity and what corrections are applied for unresolved binarity.
Correcting for mass segregation increases this to ~1240-1560M_{sun}, about
twice the total mass of the Pleiades.

transition, its final microstructure depends sensitively on the cooling rate.
For instance, an adiabatic cooling across the transition results in an
equilibrium `ferrite', while a rapid cooling gives rise to a metastable twinned
`martensite'. There exists no theoretical framework to understand the dynamics
and conditions under which both these microstructures obtain. Existing theories
of martensite dynamics describe this transformation in terms of elastic strain,
without any explanation for the occurence of the ferrite. Here we provide
evidence for the crucial role played by non-elastic variables, {\it viz.},
dynamically generated interfacial defects. A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
of a model 2-dimensional (2d) solid-state transformation reveals two distinct
modes of nucleation depending on the temperature of quench. At high
temperatures, defects generated at the nucleation front relax quickly giving
rise to an isotropically growing `ferrite'. At low temperatures, the defects
relax extremely slowly, forcing a coordinated motion of atoms along specific
directions. This results in a twinned critical nucleus which grows rapidly at
speeds comparable to that of sound. Based on our MD results, we propose a
solid-state nucleation theory involving the elastic strain and non-elastic
defects, which successfully describes the transformation to both a ferrite and
a martensite. Our work provides useful insights on how to formulate a general
dynamics of solid state transformations.

the first order nature of the transition line. We suggest that the destruction
of the ordered vortex state in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ leading to vortex
liquid (at high temperatures and low fields) and amorphous vortex solid (at low
temperatures and high fields), takes place along a unified first-order
transition line. The nonmonotonic behavior of this first order transition line
gives rise to the possibility of more than one Kauzmann point where the
entropies of the ordered and disordered vortex states are equal. In the high
temperature region, one may order the vortex lattice by warming it, giving rise
to an inverse melting effect.

data. In contrast to the acoustic frequency region, higher-order terms
contribute significantly to the self-energy at optical phonon frequencies. The
asymmetric dependence of the self-energy of a binary isotope system $m_{1-x}
M_x$ on the concentration of the heavier isotope mass x can be explained by
taking into account second- and third-order perturbation terms. For elemental
semiconductors, the maximum of the self-energy occurs at concentrations with
$0.5<x<0.7$, depending on the strength of the third-order term. Reasonable
approximations are imposed that allow us to derive explicit expressions for the
ratio of successive perturbation terms of the real and the imaginary part of
the self-energy. This basic theoretical approach is compatible with Raman
spectroscopic results on diamond and silicon, with calculations based on the
coherent potential approximation, and with theoretical results obtained using
{\it ab initio} electronic theory. The extension of the formalism to binary
compounds, by taking into account the eigenvectors at the individual
sublattices, is straightforward. In this manner, we interpret recent
experimental results on the disorder-induced broadening of the TO (folded)
modes of SiC with a $^{13}{\rm C}$-enriched carbon sublattice.

folds, finding out that an extended neutral network in sequence space is
associated to each of them. Within our model, neutral evolution leads to a
non-Poissonian substitution process, due to the broad distribution of
connectivities in neutral networks. The observation that the substitution
process has non-Poissonian statistics has been used against the original
Kimura's neutral theory, while our model shows that this is a generic property
of neutral evolution with structural conservation. Our model also predicts that
the substitution rate can strongly fluctuate from one branch to another of the
evolutionary tree. The average sequence similarity within a neutral network is
close to the threshold of randomness, as observed for families of sequences
sharing the same fold. Nevertheless, some positions are more difficult to
mutate than others. We compare such structurally conserved positions to
positions conserved in protein evolution, suggesting that our model can be a
valuable tool to distinguish structural from functional conservation in
databases of protein families. These results indicate that a synergy between
database analysis and structurally-based computational studies can increase our
understanding of protein evolution.

dimensional supersymmetric SU(5) gauge theory on an S^1/(Z_2\times Z_2')

Motivated by this construction and several related realistic models, we
investigate the general structure of orbifolds in the effective field theory
context, and of this orbifold symmetry breaking mechanism in particular. An
analysis of the group theoretic structure of orbifold breaking is performed.
This depends upon the existence of appropriate inner and outer automorphisms of
the Lie algebra, and we show that a reduction of the rank of the GUT group is
possible. Some aspects of larger GUT theories based on SO(10) and E_6 are
discussed. We explore the possibilities of defining the theory directly on a
space with boundaries and breaking the gauge symmetry by more general
consistently chosen boundary conditions for the fields. Furthermore, we derive
the relation of orbifold breaking with the familiar mechanism of Wilson line
breaking, finding a one-to-one correspondence, both conceptually and
technically. Finally, we analyse the consistency of orbifold models in the
effective field theory context, emphasizing the necessity for self-adjoint
extensions of the Hamiltonian and other conserved operators, and especially the
highly restrictive anomaly cancellation conditions that apply if the bulk
theory lives in more than 5 dimensions.

Bjorken SR, one infers for $P$-wave states $|\tau_{1/2}(1)| \ll
|\tau_{3/2}(1)|$. This implies, in the heavy quark limit of QCD, a hierarchy
for the {\it production} rates of $P$-states $\Gamma(\bar{B}_d \to D ({1 \over
2}) \ell \nu) \ll \Gamma(\bar{B}_d \to D ({3 \over 2}) \ell \nu)$ that seems at
present to be contradicted by experiment. It was also shown that the decay
constants of $j = {3 \over 2}$ $P$-states vanish in the heavy quark limit of
QCD, $f_{3/2}^{(n)} = 0$. Assuming the {\it model} of factorization in the
decays $\bar{B}_d \to \bar{D}_s^{**}D$, one expects the opposite hierarchy for
the {\it emission} rates $\Gamma(\bar{B}_d \to \bar{D}_s ({3 \over 2}) D) \ll
\Gamma(\bar{B}_d \to \bar{D}_s ({1 \over 2}) D)$, since $j = {1 \over 2}$
$P$-states are coupled to vacuum. Moreover, using Bjorken SR and previously
discovered SR involving heavy-light meson decay constants and IW functions, one
can prove that the sums $\sum\limits_n ({f^{(n)} \over f^{(0)}})^2$,
$\sum\limits_n ({f_{1/2}^{(n)} \over f^{(0)}})^2$ (where $f^{(n)}$ and
$f_{1/2}^{(n)}$ are the decay constants of $S$-states and $j = {1\over 2}$
$P$-states) are divergent. This situation seems to be realized in the
relativistic quark models \`a la Bakamjian and Thomas, that satisfy HQET and
predict decays constants $f^{(n)}$ and $f_{1/2}^{(n)}$ that do not decrease
with the radial quantum number $n$.

than $90^\circ$. Constraints on the functions $F^i_{tt}$ imposed by the present

for large $\tan\bar\beta\equiv v_2/v_1$ and $H^+$ not too heavy, $F^s_{tt}$ in
the MSSM with heavy sparticles can be substantially smaller than in the SM due
the charged Higgs box contributions and in particular due to the growing like
$\tan^4\bar\beta$ contribution of the double penguin diagrams involving neutral
Higgs boson exchanges. As a result the bounds on the function $F^s_{tt}$ can be
violated which allows to exclude large mixing of stops. In this scenario the
range of $\sin2\beta$ following from $\epsilon$ and $\Delta M_d$ is identical

Plausible candidates for the UHECR primaries are the decay products of a
meta--stable matter state with mass of order O(10^{12-15 GeV}), which
simultaneously is a good cold dark matter candidate. We study possible
meta-stable matter states that arise from Wilson line breaking of GUT
symmetries in semi-realistic heterotic string models. In the models that we
study the exotic matter states can be classified according to patterns of
SO(10) symmetry breaking. We show that cryptons, which are states that carry
fractional electric charge $\pm1/2$, and are confined by a hidden gauge group
cannot produce viable dark matter. This is due to the fact that, in addition to
the lightest neutral bound state, cryptons give rise to meta-stable charged
bound states. However, these states may still account for the UHECR events. We
argue that the uniton, which is an exotic Standard Model quark but carries
``fractional'' U(1)_{Z'} charge, as well as the singleton, which is a Standard
Model singlet with ``fractional'' U(1)_{Z'} charge do provide viable dark
matter candidates and can at the same time explain the observed UHECR events.

of the above-mentioned Coulomb gas with the condensate of the dual Higgs field,
described by the dual Abelian Higgs model. It is demonstrated that in a certain
limit of this dual Abelian Higgs model, the system under study undergoes
naively the dimensional reduction and becomes described by the (completely

transition in such a model must be of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type,

the theory is equivalent to taking into account transfer of momentum. The
second approach we pursue is the AdS/CFT correspondence. We provide a
holographic reconstruction of the bulk space-time metric and of bulk fields on
this space-time, out of conformal field theory data. Knowing which sources are
turned on is sufficient in order to obtain an asymptotic expansion of the bulk
metric and of bulk fields near the boundary to high enough order so that all
infrared divergences of the on-shell action are obtained. We provide explicit
formulae for the holographic stress-energy tensors associated with an arbitrary
asymptotically AdS geometry. We also study warped compactifications, where our
d-dimensional world is regarded as a slice of a (d+1)-dimensional space-time,
and analyse in detail the question as to where the d-dimensional observer can
find the information about the extra dimension.

simplification of the Hubbard model; by neglecting the kinetic (hopping) energy
of the spin up particles, one gets the Falicov-Kimball model.
  We show that away from half-filling, i.e. if the sum of the densities of both

lowest eigenvalues of the discrete Laplace operator in an arbitrary domain,
with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The lower bound consists of a bulk term,
independent of the shape of the domain, and of a term proportional to the

by choosing a domain with a small boundary. For the Falicov-Kimball model, this
corresponds to having a single `compact' domain that has no heavy particles.

structure of the low-dimensional ODE's defined by the classes of exact
solutions of the problem without surface tension. Some simple examples are
studied in detail, and general proofs concerning properties of fixed points and
existence of finite-time singularities for broad classes of solutions are
given. The existence of a continuum of multifinger fixed points and its
dynamical implications are discussed. The main conclusion is that exact
zero-surface tension solutions taken in a global sense as families of
trajectories in phase space spanning a sufficiently large set of initial
conditions, are unphysical because the multifinger fixed points are
nonhyperbolic, and an unfolding of them does not exist within the same class of
solutions. Hyperbolicity (saddle-point structure) of the multifinger fixed
points is argued to be essential to the physically correct qualitative
description of finger competition. The restoring of hyperbolicity by surface
tension is discussed as the key point for a generic Dynamical Solvability
Scenario which is proposed for a general context of interfacial pattern
selection.

of a point charge and a magnetic moment through order second order in 1/c is
suggested. This relativistic analysis connects together hidden momentum in
magnets, Solem's strange polarization of the classical hydrogen atom, and the
Aharonov-Bohm Phase shift. We use a relativistic magnetic moment model
consisting of many superimposed classical hydrogen atoms interacting through
the Darwin Lagrangian with an external charge but not with each other. The
analysis of Solem regarding the strange polarization of the classical hydrogen
atom is seen to give a fundamentally different mechanism for the electric field
of the passing charge to change the magnetic moment. The changing magnetic
moment leads to an electric force back at the point charge which i)is second
order in 1/c, ii)depends upon the magnetic dipole moment, changing sign with
the dipole moment, iii)is odd in the charge q of the passing charge, and
iv)reverses sign for charges passing on opposite sides of the magnetic moment.
We suggest that a realistic multi-particle magnetic moment involves a changing
magnetic moment which keeps the electromagnetic field momentum constant. This
means also that the magnetic moment does not allow a significant shift in its
internal center of energy. This criterion also implies that the Lorentz forces
on the charged particle and on the point charge are equal and opposite and that
the center of energy of each moves according to Newton's second law where the
force is exactly the Lorentz force. Finally, we note that the results and
suggestion given here are precisely what are needed to explain both the
Aharonov-Bohm phase shift and the Aharonov-Casher phase shift as arising from
classical electromagnetic forces.

respect to the pre-Kepler celestial kinematics. In ""Astronomia Nova"" we assist
to the attempt of Kepler to get for Mars an orbit consistent with the results
of Tycho Brahe's observations. Passing through several phases and step by step
discarding the hypoteses wich gave results in contrast with observations,
Kepler arrived at establishing that the orbit of Mars around the Sun is an
ellipse. Here an esposition is given of this work of analysis by Kepler wich
is, in the history of science, one of the early examples of rigorous setting up
of a model which correctly explains the experimental results.

diagonal in the Bell basis, such that when the expectation value $<\hat A>$ is
taken as prior information the problem of fake entanglement is not solved by
adding a new constraint associated with the mean value of $\hat A^2$ (unlike
what happens when the partial information is given by the expectation value of
a Bell operator). The fake entanglement generated by the maximum entropy
principle is also studied quantitatively by comparing the entanglement of
formation of the inferred state with that of the original one.

propagation of a wave in the presence of disorder have been extensively
studied, as exemplified in coherent backscattering (CBS) of light. In the
multiple scattering of light by a disordered sample of thermal atoms,
interference effects are usually washed out by the fast atomic motion. This is
no longer true for cold atoms where CBS has recently been observed. However,
the internal structure of the atoms strongly influences the interference
properties. In this paper, we consider light scattering by an atomic dipole
transition with arbitrary degeneracy and study its impact on coherent
backscattering. We show that the interference contrast is strongly reduced.
Assuming a uniform statistical distribution over internal degrees of freedom,
we compute analytically the single and double scattering contributions to the
intensity in the weak localization regime. The so-called ladder and crossed
diagrams are generalized to the case of atoms and permit to calculate
enhancement factors and backscattering intensity profiles for polarized light
and any closed atomic dipole transition.
