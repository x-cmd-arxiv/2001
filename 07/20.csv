propose an alternative interpretation of the arcs in the nebular X-radiation

the arcs as traces of the particle beams from the two magnetic poles at the

jet-like feature bisecting the arcs is an effect of projection on the sky plane
and that there is no physical jet along the axis of rotation.

spectrum of the CMB sky via heuristically weighted correlation functions. Part
of the new technique is that all (co)variances are evaluated by massive Monte
Carlo simulations, therefore a fast way to measure correlation functions in a
high resolution map is essential. This letter presents a new algorithm to
calculate pixel space correlation functions via fast spherical harmonics
transforms. Our present implementation of the idea extracts correlations from a
MAP-like CMB map (HEALPix resolution of 512, i.e. $ \simeq 3 \times 10^6$
pixels) in about 5 minutes on a 500MHz computer, including $C_\ell$ inversion;
the analysis of one Planck-like map takes less then one hour. We use heuristic
window and noise weighting in pixel space, and include the possibility of
additional signal weighting as well, either in $\ell$ or pixel space. We apply
the new code to an ensemble of MAP simulations, to test the response of our
method to the inhomogenous sky coverage/noise of MAP. We show that the
resulting $C_\ell$'s are very close to the theoretical expectations. The
HEALPix based implementation of the method, SpICE (Spatially Inhomogenous
Correlation Estimator) will be available to the public from the authors.

indicate that these binary stars contain collapsed objects too heavy to be

candidates. X-ray observations of several of these X-ray novae in quiescence
with the Chandra X-ray Observatory show that the systems are approximately 100
times fainter than nearly identical X-ray novae containing neutron stars. The
advection-dominated accretion flow model provides a natural explanation for the
difference. In this model, the accreting gas reaches the accretor at the center
with a large amount of thermal energy. If the accretor is a black hole, the
thermal energy will disappear through the event horizon, and the object will be
very dim. If the accretor is a neutron star or any other object with a surface,
the energy will be radiated from the surface, and the object will be bright. We
discuss alternate interpretations of the data that eliminate the need for
advection-dominated accretion. Most of these alternatives still require an
event horizon to explain the unusually low X-ray luminosities of the black hole
candidates. Some of the alternatives are also inconsistent with observations.

the merger process (including shock heating, hydrodynamic mixing, mass
ejection, and angular momentum transfer) with simple algorithms based on

10 to 45 days, using photometry with the DoPHOT program. The de-reddened
distance to NGC 3982 is estimated from these data using various criteria to
maximize signal to noise and reliability: the values lie between 31.71 and
31.82, with uncertainties in the mean of typically +/- 0.14 mag for each case.

(M-m)_0 = 31.72 +/- 0.14 (22 +/- 1.5 Mpc).
  Photometry of 1998aq that is available in the literature is used in
combination with the derived distance to NGC 3982 to obtain the peak absolute
magnitude of this supernova. The lower limit (no extinction within the host
galaxy) for M_V is -19.47 +/- 0.15 mag. Corrections for decline rate and
intrinsic color to carry these to the reduced system of Parodi et al. (2000)

errors and including uncertainty estimates due to them leads to H_0 = 58.7 +/-

derived from the formulation of two questions: (A) Can a globally inertial
space and time be associated with a non-trivial global matter distribution? (B)
If so, what are the general properties of such a global distribution? The
answers are yes subject to the condition that mass is distributed fractally
with D=2. Such a prediction is supported, for example, in Joyce, Montuori,
Labini astro-ph/9901290.
  The second paper then shows how gravitational phenomena arise as consequences
of perturbations of this equilibrium D=2 distribution, and applies this theory
to spiral galaxy dynamics. Specifically, the second paper derives a
gravitational model for an idealized spiral, defined to have perfect
cylindrical symmetry. One of the main results of this analysis is that, *in the
disc*, V_rot = A/R^alpha where (A, alpha) are constants which vary between
spirals. See astro-ph/0107305, which concludes that a power-law model is
powerfully confirmed for ORCs as a statistical generality over large samples,
and astro-ph/0107300 for new phenomonology discovered via this analysis.
  Thus, unlike MOND, we have only been concerned with model predictions made
for idealized matter distributions, and tested over very large numbers of ORCs.
But, like those of MOND, the predictions are very powerfully supported on the
data. For this reason, we hypothesize that perspectives of MOND are buried
within our own formalism. This remains a topic for future work.

[Fe/H] with an accuracy ~ 0.15-0.20 dex over the range -4.0 <= [Fe/H] <= +0.3.
Such accuracies are competitive with the results obtained by fine analysis of

these results without consideration of photometric information for these stars.
We have also explored the impact of the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) on the

near the antiferromagnetic instability in two dimensions. This model describes
low-energy fermions interacting with their own collective spin fluctuations,
which soften at the antiferromagnetic transition. We argue that in 2D, the
system has two typical energies - an effective spin-fermion interaction $\bar
g$ and an energy $\omega_{sf}$ below which the system behaves as a Fermi
liquid. The ratio of the two determines the dimensionless coupling constant for
spin-fermion interaction $\lambda^2 \propto {\bar g}/\omega_{sf}$. We show that
$\lambda$ scales with the spin correlation length and diverges at criticality.
This divergence implies that the conventional perturbative expansion breaks
down. We developed a novel approach to the problem - the expansion in either
the inverse number of hot spots in the Brillouin zone, or the inverse number of
fermionic flavors - which allowed us to explicitly account for all terms which
diverge as powers of $\lambda$, and treat the remaining, $O(\lambda)$ terms in
the RG formalism. We applied this technique to study the properties of the
spin-fermion model in various frequency and temperature regimes. We present the
results for the fermionic spectral function, spin susceptibility, optical
conductivity and other observables. We compare our results in detail with the

of double-stranded DNA under the influence of an applied force. In the limit of
long polymers, there is a thermodynamic unzipping transition at a critical
force value of order 10 pN, with different critical behavior for homopolymers
and for random heteropolymers. We extend results on the disorder-averaged
behavior of DNA's with random sequences to the more experimentally accessible
problem of unzipping a single DNA molecule. As the applied force approaches the
critical value, the double-stranded DNA unravels in a series of discrete,
sequence-dependent steps that allow it to reach successively deeper energy
minima. Plots of extension versus force thus take the striking form of a series
of plateaus separated by sharp jumps. Similar qualitative features should
reappear in micromanipulation experiments on proteins and on folded RNA
molecules. Despite their unusual form, the extension versus force curves for
single molecules still reveal remnants of the disorder-averaged critical
behavior. Above the transition, the dynamics of the unzipping fork is related
to that of a particle diffusing in a random force field; anomalous,
disorder-dominated behavior is expected until the applied force exceeds the
critical value for unzipping by roughly 5 pN.

production of gravitinos has been shown to be sufficiently small if the sector
ultimately responsible for supersymmetry breaking is coupled only
gravitationally to the inflationary sector. Still, in some models, inflatinos
can be created during preheating with a substantial abundance. The main
contribution to the gravitino abundance may thus come from their decay into the
inflaton, or into its scalar partner, as well as from the inverse processes. We
show that this production needs to be strongly suppressed. This suppression can
be realized in the simplest scenarios which typically have a sufficiently high

able to extract the masses of the selectron as well as the associated
sneutrinos with a precision of ~ 1% by determining the kinematic end points of
the energy spectrum of daughter electrons produced in their two body decays to
a lighter neutralino or chargino. Recently, it has been suggested that by
studying the energy dependence of the cross section near the production
threshold, this precision can be improved by an order of magnitude, assuming an
integrated luminosity of 100 fb^-1. It is further suggested that these
threshold scans also allow the masses of even the heavier second and third
generation sleptons and sneutrinos to be determined to better than 0.5%. We
re-examine the prospects for determining sneutrino masses. We find that the
cross sections for the second and third generation sneutrinos are too small for
a threshold scan to be useful. An additional complication arises because the
cross section for sneutrino pair to decay into any visible final state(s)
necessarily depends on an unknown branching fraction, so that the overall
normalization in unknown. This reduces the precision with which the sneutrino
mass can be extracted. We propose a different strategy to optimize the
extraction of m(\tilde{\nu}_\mu) and m(\tilde{\nu}_\tau) via the energy
dependence of the cross section. We find that even with an integrated
luminosity of 500 fb^-1, these can be determined with a precision no better
than several percent at the 90% CL. We also examine the measurement of
m(\tilde{\nu}_e) and show that it can be extracted with a precision of about

supersymmetric models with chiral matter, including those with the Standard
Model and grand unified gauge groups. We perform a search for realistic gauge

orientifold with SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y gauge group and three quark-lepton

contains right-handed neutrinos, a (chiral but anomaly-free) set of exotic
multiplets, and diverse vector-like multiplets. The general class of these

transitions, which in some cases change the number of generations, as discussed
in specific models. These constructions are supersymmetric only for special
choices of untwisted moduli. We briefly discuss the supersymmetry breaking
effects away from that point. The M-theory lift of this general class of
supersymmetric orientifold models should correspond to purely geometrical
backgrounds admitting a singular G_2 holonomy metric and leading to
four-dimensional M-theory vacua with chiral fermions.

g_4(K) <= g_c(K) <= g(K). Casson and Nakanishi gave examples to show that
g_4(K) need not equal g_c(K). We begin by reviewing and extending their

  For knots representing elements in A, the concordance group of algebraically
slice knots, the relationships between these genera are less clear. Casson and
Gordon's result that A is nontrivial implies that g_4(K) can be nonzero for
knots in A. Gilmer proved that g_4(K) can be arbitrarily large for knots in A.
We will prove that there are knots K in A with g_4(K) = 1 and g_c(K)

exceptions, all prime knots with fewer than 10 crossings. This requires the

reduced if the group velocity of the accelerating mode is reduced and
additionally it has been discovered that reducing the length of the
accelerating structure also limits the number and intensity of breakdown events
[1]. However, in designing new accelerating structures care must be taken to
ensure that the beam-induced transverse wakefields do not cause the beam to
become unstable. Here, we report on damping transverse wakefields in two
different short structures: a 90cm traveling wave structure in which the
wakefield is coupled out to four attached manifolds and secondly, in a standing

preliminary experimental evidence, suggests that shorter and lower group

detuning of the cell frequencies and by locally damping individual cells in

for the mathematics of spacetime, which is inconsistent with quantum
experiments. This article reveals a solution by mathematically combining
existing ideas of quantum mechanics. The model resulting from this combination
not only predicts that space and time emerge simultaneously from quantum
entanglement but that the mathematics of spacetime is influenced by factors
that differ between the quantum and cosmic scales. Specifically, two such
factors are identified. This new model suggests that quantum physicists have
not just found a way to model the world, they are reverse engineering the
base-code of the universe. This article demonstrates that, taken seriously,
this suggestion offers a technical framework for analysis of and valuable
insights into modern physics.

explained by numerical and analytical calculations. These show that only a
small subthermal range of collision energies near threshold contributes to the

resonances survive thermal averaging, and may be detectable for Ca cooled near
the Doppler cooling temperature of the 4^1P <- 4^1S laser cooling transition.

which does not require repeated spontaneous emission by each molecule. The
cooling works by repetition of three main steps: velocity selection of a narrow
momentum width, deceleration of velocity selected molecules and accumulation of
the decelerated molecules by an irreversible process, namely by single
spontaneous emission. We develop a cooling model which enables analytical
description of the transient populations and entropies for the total molecular
system, the center of mass degree of freedom and the internal degrees of
freedom. Simulation shows that the cooling process can reduce a large momentum
width to a final width which in principle can be arbitrarily small. Center of
mass entropy is reduced while the internal entropy is increased after cooling.
We show that translational cooling can occur during coherent laser
interactions. The entropies change in consistency with the Araki-Lieb
inequality.

studied numerically and analytically within quantum and classical approaches.
Husimi Q-functions and their classical trajectory simulations are analysed to
reveal a special regime corresponding to the time-stable sub-Poissonian
photocount statistics of the sum-frequency mode. Conditions for observation of
this regime are discussed. Theoretical predictions of the Fano factor and
explanation of the extraordinary stabilization of the sub-Poissonian photocount
behavior are obtained analytically by applying the classical trajectories.
Scaling laws for the maximum sub-Poissonian behavior are found. Noise
suppression levels in the non-degenerate vs degenerate three-wave mixing are
discussed on different time scales compared to the revival times. It is shown
that the non-degenerate conversion offers much better stabilization of the
suppressed noise in comparison to that of degenerate process.
