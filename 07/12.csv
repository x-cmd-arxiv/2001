satellite in March 1998 along one orbital period. The luminosity of the source
(in the 0.1-100 keV band) ranges from $2.5 \times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at the
periastron (orbital phase 0.01) to $1.5 \times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at orbital
phase 0.3. From the spectral analysis and the lightcurve we argue that Cir X-1
shows three states along the orbital evolution. The first state is at the
orbital phase interval 0.97-0.3: the luminosity becames super-Eddington and a
strong flaring activity is present. In this state a shock could form in the
inner region of the system due to the super-Eddington accretion rate, producing
an outflow of ionized matter whose observational signature could be the
prominent absorption edge at $\sim 8.7$ keV observed in the energy spectrum at
these phases. In the second state, corresponding to the orbital phase interval
between 0.3 and 0.7, the accretion rate is sub-Eddington and we observe a
weaker outflow, with smaller hydrogen column: the absorption edge is now at
$\sim 8.3$ keV with an optical depth a factor of 2.5 to 6 smaller. The third
state corresponds to the orbital phase interval 0.78-0.97. In this state the
best fit model to the spectrum requires the presence of a partial covering
component, indicating that the emission from the compact object is partially
absorbed by neutral matter, probably the atmosphere of the companion star
and/or the accreting matter from the companion.

formation. Spatial variations in star formation are frequently observed in many
dwarf galaxies in the Local Group and beyond. These spatial variations range
from a seemingly stochastic distribution of star-forming regions in gas-rich,
high-mass dwarfs to radial gradients in low-mass dwarfs. The global mode of
star formation may be either continuous with amplitude variations or episodic.
High-mass dwarf galaxies tend to form stars over a Hubble time, whereas
low-mass dwarfs eventually cease to form stars, possibly aided by environmental
effects. Much less is known about the content and properties of dwarf galaxies
in the Local Volume, which we are trying to remedy through a large

properties of the model clusters using observed cluster statistical
relationships. We consider impact parameters between zero and five times the
scale radius and mass ratios of 1:1 and 1:3. The morphological changes,
relative velocities, and temperature jumps we observe agree with previous
studies using the King profile for the dark matter. We observe a larger jump in
X-ray luminosity (~4-10x) than in previous work, and we argue that this
increase is most likely a lower limit due to our spatial resolution. We
emphasize that luminosity and temperature jumps due to mergers may have an
important bearing on constraints on Omega derived from the observation of hot
clusters at high redshift. Shocks are relatively weak in the cluster cores;
hence they do not significantly increase the entropy there. Instead, shocks
create entropy in the outer regions, and this high-entropy gas is mixed with
the core gas during later stages of the merger. Ram pressure initiates mixing
by displacing the core gas from its potential center, causing it to become
convectively unstable. The resulting convective plumes produce large-scale
turbulent motions with eddy sizes up to several 100 kpc. This turbulence is
pumped by dark matter-driven oscillations in the gravitational potential. Even
after nearly a Hubble time these motions persist as subsonic turbulence in the
cluster cores, providing 5-10% of the support against gravity.

therefore, of interest to investigate whether the molecular gas, which is the
star-forming medium, has a similar distribution. Though our low-resolution
single-dish radial profiles of CO emission can be described by simple
exponentials, this is not true for the emission at our full 6"" resolution. The
scale lengths of the CO disks are correlated with the scale lengths of the
stellar disks with a mean ratio of the scale lengths of about one. We also find
that:(1) there is also a weak correlation between the ratio of K-band to CO
luminosity and Hubble type; (2) in half of the galaxies presented here, CO
emission does not peak at the location of the stellar nucleus; (3) averaged
over the inner kiloparsec, the CO emission in one-half of the galaxies exhibits
an excess over that expected from an exponential disk which is similar to the
excess in stellar light caused by the bulge stars; and (4) this excess CO
emission may be due to an increase in the total molecular gas content in the
bulge region, or alternatively, to an increase in the CO emissivity caused by
the increased pressure of the bulge region.

heavy ashes from the hydrogen burning rapid proton (rp) process. The key to
early unstable ignition is the low thermal conductivity of a heavy element
ocean. The instability requires accretion rates in excess of one-tenth the
Eddington limit when the carbon mass fraction is 0.1 or less. The unstable
flashes release 10^{42} to 10^{43} ergs over hours to days, and are likely the
cause of the recently discovered large Type I X-ray bursts (so-called
``superbursts'') from six Galactic low mass X-ray binaries. In addition to
explaining the energetics, recurrence times, and durations of the superbursts,
these mixed carbon/heavy element flashes have an accretion rate dependence of
unstable burning similar to that observed. Though the instability is present at
accretion rates near Eddington, there is less contrast with the accretion
luminosity there, explaining why most detections are made at accretion rates

initial state is a stable neutron star to which an inward radial kinetic energy
has been added through some velocity profile. For two different equations of
state and two different shapes of velocity profiles, it is found that neutron
stars can collapse to black holes for high enough inward velocities, provided
that their masses are higher than some minimal value, depending on the equation
of state. For a polytropic equation of state of the form $p=K\rho^\gamma $,
with $\gamma = 2$ it is found to be $1.16 (\frac{K}{0.1})^{0.5} \msol$, whereas
for a more realistic one, it reads $0.36 \msol $. In some cases of collapse
forming a black hole, part of the matter composing the initial neutron star can
be ejected through a shock, leaving only a fraction of the initial mass to form
a black hole. Therefore, black holes of very small masses can be formed and, in
particular, the mass scaling relation, as a function of initial velocity, takes
the form discovered by Choptuik for critical collapses.

  ignorant, minor typo corrections","Results Math. 40 (2001), no. 1-4, 88--121",,,"math.DG",,"  The problem of immersing a simply connected surface with a prescribed shape
operator is discussed. From classical and more recent work, it is known that,
aside from some special degenerate cases, such as when the shape operator can
be realized by a surface with one family of principal curves being geodesic,
the space of such realizations is a convex set in an affine space of dimension
at most 3. The cases where this maximum dimension of realizability is achieved
have been classified and it is known that there are two such families of shape
operators, one depending essentially on three arbitrary functions of one
variable (called Type I in this article) and another depending essentially on
two arbitrary functions of one variable (called Type II in this article).
  In this article, these classification results are rederived, with an emphasis
on explicit computability of the space of solutions. It is shown that, for
operators of either type, their realizations by immersions can be computed by
quadrature. Moreover, explicit normal forms for each can be computed by
quadrature together with, in the case of Type I, by solving a single linear
second order ODE in one variable. (Even this last step can be avoided in most
Type I cases.)
  The space of realizations is discussed in each case, along with some of their
remarkable geometric properties. Several explicit examples are constructed
(mostly already in the literature) and used to illustrate various features of
the problem.

optimally designing experiments to measure these amplitudes, whose energy
dependence (particularly that of the real parts) is needed for disentangling
various sources of medium modifications of the projectile-nucleon interaction.
The issues considered include determining the angular region over which to make

of statistical and systematic errors. We find that there is a region near the
forward direction where Coulomb-nuclear interference allows reliable extraction
of the strong forward amplitude for both pions and the $K^+$ from .3 to 1

resonance made of quarks or gluons and discuss its interplay with the continuum

continuum one. It is also investigated the possibility of observing a scalar
resonance (the $\sigma$ meson) in this process. Assuming for the $\sigma$ the
mass and total decay width values recently reported by the E791 Collaboration
we show that RHIC may detect this particle in its two photon decay mode if its
partial photonic decay width is of the order of the ones discussed in the

is explicitly shown that the inclusion of nuclear form factors validates the
equivalent photon approximation. However, this does not apply to three-photon
fusion cross sections. The cross section of J/\psi production in
ultra-peripheral collisions at RHIC and LHC are shown to be much smaller than
the cross sections for the production of C=even mesons of similar masses.

different parametrisations of a chiral SU(3) sigma-omega model. The
selfconsistent collective expansion includes the effects of effective hadron
masses, generated by the nonstrange and strange scalar condensates. Different
chiral EoS show different types of phase transitions and even a crossover. The
influence of the order of the phase transition and of the difference in the
latent heat on the space-time dynamics and pion-HBT radii is studied. A small
latent heat, i.e. a weak first-order chiral phase transition, or even a smooth
crossover leads to distinctly different HBT predictions than a strong first
order phase transition. A quantitative description of the data, both at SPS
energies as well as at RHIC energies, appears difficult to achieve within the
ideal hydrodynamical approach using the SU(3) chiral EoS. A strong first-order
quasi-adiabatic chiral phase transition seems to be disfavored by the pion-HBT
