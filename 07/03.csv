the application of deconvolution algorithms have permitted us to separate the

it. The core has a steep spectral index and is likely due primarily to the AGN.
The faint emission has a positive spectral index and is clearly due to extended
dust in a patchy distribution out to a radius of $\sim$ 20 kpc from the
nucleus. These observations have now revealed that a large quantity of dust,
$\sim$ 6 $\times$ 10$^7$ $M_\odot$, 2 orders of magnitude larger than that
inferred from previous optical absorption measurements, exists in this galaxy.
We estimate the temperature of this dust to be $\sim$ 20 K (using an emissivity
index of $\beta$ = 1.3) and the gas/dust ratio to be 360. These values are
typical of spiral galaxies. The dust emission correlates spatially with the hot
X-ray emitting gas which may be due to collisional heating of broadly
distributed dust by electrons. Since the destruction timescale is short, the
dust cannot be replenished by stellar mass loss and must be externally
supplied, either via the infalling galaxy or the cooling flow itself.

Galactic rotation in NGC 3077 is detected for the first time in the molecular
gas. The molecular gas counterrotates with respect to the large scale HI tidal
bridge. The molecular clouds closest to the starburst have super-virial
linewidths, possibly related to the turbulence generated by the starburst. The

sustain star formation for only ~10 Myrs; thus NGC 3077 is a true starburst
galaxy. The derived age of the starburst is consistent with the inferred ages

different directions for even very short lines of sight. However,
interpretation of these components remains difficult. It is uncertain whether
the components represent physically distinct clouds or perhaps are just
symptomatic of velocity gradients within the cloud. Finally, since it is the

is that it allows one to a priori control the average fraction of false
rejections made (when comparing to the null hypothesis) over the total number
of rejections performed. We compare FDR to the standard procedure of rejecting
all tests that do not match the null hypothesis above some arbitrarily chosen
confidence limit, e.g. 2 sigma, or at the 95% confidence level. When using FDR,
we find a similar rate of correct detections, but with significantly fewer
false detections. Moreover, the FDR procedure is quick and easy to compute and
can be trivially adapted to work with correlated data. The purpose of this
paper is to introduce the FDR procedure to the astrophysics community. We
illustrate the power of FDR through several astronomical examples, including
the detection of features against a smooth one-dimensional function, e.g.
seeing the ``baryon wiggles'' in a power spectrum of matter fluctuations, and
source pixel detection in imaging data. In this era of large datasets and high

individual clouds. This allows us to define two classes of cloud distributions:
thin and thick layers. We define the critical cloud separation along the

quite massive (~100-300 M_sun). Could these stars have left a distinct
nucleosynthetic signature? We explore the nucleosynthesis of helium cores in
the mass range M_He=64 to 133 Msun, corresponding to main-sequence star masses
of approximately 140 to 260 M_sun. Above M_He=133 M_sun, without rotation and
using current reaction rates, a black hole is formed and no nucleosynthesis is
ejected. For lighter helium core masses, ~40 to 63 M_sun, violent pulsations
occur, induced by the pair instability and accompanied by supernova-like mass
ejection, but the star eventually produces a large iron core in hydrostatic
equilibrium. It is likely that this core, too, collapses to a black hole, thus
cleanly separating the heavy element nucleosynthesis of pair instability
supernovae from those of other masses, both above and below. Indeed, black hole
formation is a likely outcome for all Population III stars with main sequence
masses between about 25 M_sun and 140 M_sun (M_He = 9 to 63 M_sun) as well as
those above 260 M_sun. Nucleosynthesis in pair-instability supernovae varies
greatly with the mass of the helium core which determines the maximum
temperature reached during the bounce. At the upper range of exploding core
masses, a maximum of 57 M_sun of Ni56 is produced making these the most
energetic and the brightest thermonuclear explosions in the universe.
Integrating over a distribution of masses, we find that pair instability
supernovae produce a roughly solar distribution of nuclei having even nuclear
charge, but are remarkably deficient in producing elements with odd nuclear
charge. Also, essentially no elements heavier than zinc are produced due to a
lack of s- and r-processes.

Pb, which forms the final abundance peak of the s-process, enable a comparison
of the abundance patterns from Sr (Z=38) to Pb (Z=82) with predictions of AGB
models. The derived chemical compositions provide strong constraints on the AGB
stellar models, as well as on s-process nucleosynthesis at low metallicity. The
present paper reports details of the abundance analysis for 16 neutron-capture
elements in LP 625-44, including the effects of hyperfine splitting and isotope
shifts of spectral lines for some elements. A Pb abundance is also derived for
LP706-7 by a re-analysis of a previously observed spectrum. We investigate the
characteristics of the nucleosynthesis pathway that produces the abundance
ratios of these objects using a parametric model of the s-process without
adopting any specific stellar model. The neutron exposure tau is estimated to
be about 0.7mb^-1, significantly larger than that which best fits solar-system
material, but consistent with the values predicted by models of moderately
metal-poor AGB stars. This value is strictly limited by the Pb abundance, in
addition to those of Sr and Ba. We also find that the observed abundance
pattern can be explained by a few recurrent neutron exposures, and that the
overlap of the material that is processed in two subsequent exposures is small

  (1) that the observed hard X-ray tail is due to synchrotron emission. A lower
limit on the magnetic field within Tycho may be estimated B>=22 microG,
assuming that the RXTE-detected

microG is derived.
  (2) the hadronic model of Drury, Aharonian & Voelk, and (3) the more recent
time-dependent kinetic theory of Berezhko & Voelk.
  Our upper limit lies within the range of predicted values of both hadronic
models, according to uncertainties in physical parameters of Tycho, and shock
acceleration details. In the latter case, the model was scaled to suit the
parameters of Tycho and re-normalised to account for a simplification of the

reveal a lopsided H_2 distribution with an off-center secondary maximum

molecular gas as it contains M_H_2~4x10^9 M_solar. At the interface between the
CO and HI emission regions, about 8 kpc NW of the center, however, strong star
formation is present as witnessed by Halpha and radio continuum emission. This
is the region in which earlier Fabry-Perot observations revealed a
double-peaked Halpha line, indicating gas at two different velocities at the
same sky position. In order to understand these observations, we present the
results of numerical simulations of the ISM-ICM interaction. We suggest that
NGC 4848 already passed through the center of the cluster about 4x10^8 years
ago. At the observed stage ram pressure has no more direct dynamical influence
on the galaxy's ISM. We observe the galaxy when a fraction of the stripped gas
is falling back onto the galaxy. Ram pressure is thus a short-lived event with
longer-lasting consequences. The combination of ram-pressure and rotation
results in gas at different velocities colliding where the double-peaked Halpha
line is observed. Ram-pressure can thus result, after re-accretion, in
displaced molecular gas without the H_2 itself being pushed efficiently by the
ICM. A scenario where two interactions take place simultaneously is also
consistent with the available data but less probable on the basis of our
numerical simulations.

We suggest that the lack of a soft X-ray component in WW Hor is due to the fact
that the accretion area is larger than in previous observations with a
resulting lower temperature for the re-processed hard X-rays. Using a
multi-temperature model of the post-shock flow, we estimate that the white
dwarf in both systems has a mass greater than 1 Msun. The implications of this

of `Lambda-iteration'. We also present submillimetre spectral line data of the
Class 0 protostars NGC1333-IRAS2 and Serpens SMM4. We examine the physical
constraints which can be used to limit the number and range of parameters used
in protostellar envelope models, and identify the turbulent velocity and tracer
molecule abundance as the principle sources of uncertainty in the radiative
transfer modelling. We explore the trends in the appearance of the predicted

dependent not on the evolutionary status of the collapsing protostar, but on
the turbulent velocity dispersion in the envelope. We also find that the line
shapes can be significantly altered by rotation.
  Fits are found for the observed line profiles of IRAS2 and SMM4 using
plausible infall model parameters. The density and velocity profiles in our
best fit models are inconsistent with a singular isothermal sphere model. We
find better agreement with a form of collapse which assumes non-static initial
conditions. We also find some evidence that the infall velocities are retarded

the core is optically thin to its own radiation. This permits us to consider
non spherically symmetric geometries. We predict the intensity distributions of
our model cores at millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths and compare with
observations of the well studied object L1544. We have also developed an
analytical approximation for the temperature at the center of spherically
symmetric cores and we compare this with the numerical calculations. Our
results show (in agreement with Evans et al. 2001) that the temperatures in the
nuclei of cores of high visual extinction (> 30 magnitudes) are reduced to
values of below ~8 K or roughly half of the surface temperature. This has the
consequence that maps at wavelengths shortward of 1.3 mm see predominantly the
low density exterior of pre-protostellar cores. It is extremely difficult to
deduce the true density distribution from such maps alone. We have computed the
intensity distribution expected on the basis of the models of Ciolek & Basu
(2000) and compared with the observations of L1544. The agreement is good with
a preference for higher inclinations (37 degrees instead of 16) than that
adopted by Ciolek & Basu (2000). We find that a simple extension of the
analytic approximation allows a reasonably accurate calculation of the dust
temperature as a function of radius in cores with density distributions
approximating those expected for Bonnor-Ebert spheres and suggest that this may
be a useful tool for future calculations of the gas temperature in such cores.

by the formation of non local pair correlations among the two ferromagnets

insulating and ferromagnetic models can be understood from lowest order
diagrams. Metallic ferromagnets are controlled by non local pair correlations
and the superconducting gap is larger if the ferromagnetic electrodes have a
parallel spin orientation. Insulating ferromagnets are controlled by pair
breaking and the superconducting gap is smaller if the ferromagnetic electrodes
have a parallel spin orientation. The same behavior is found in the presence of
disorder in the microscopic phase variables and also in the presence of a
partial spin polarization of the ferromagnets. The different behaviors of the

calculations the weak link is assumed to be a pinhole, whose size is small in
comparison to the coherence length. We derive a quasiclassical expression for
the coupling energy of a pinhole, allowing also for scattering in the hole.
Using a selfconsistent order parameter near a wall, we calculate the
current-phase relationships in several cases. In the isotextural case, the
current-phase relations are plotted assuming a constant spin-orbit texture. In
the opposite anisotextural case the texture changes as a function of the phase
difference. For that we have to consider the stiffness of the macroscopic
texture, and we also calculate some surface interaction parameters. We analyze
the experiments by Marchenkov et al. We find that the observed pi states and
bistability hardly can be explained with the isotextural pinhole model, but a

investment strategy for investors with different attitudes towards the
trade-offs of risk and profit. The probability distribution of the return

known, while the joint distribution is unknown. The problem is to find the best
investment strategy in order to minimize the probability of losing a certain
percentage of the invested capital based on different attitudes of the
investors towards future outcomes of the stock market.
  For portfolios made up of two stocks, this work shows how to exactly and
quickly solve the problem of finding an optimal portfolio for aggressive or
risk-averse investors, using an algorithm based on a fast greedy solution to a
maximum flow problem. However, an investor looking for an average-case
guarantee (so is neither aggressive or risk-averse) must deal with a more
difficult problem. In particular, it is #P-complete to compute the distribution
function associated with the average-case bound. On the positive side,
approximate answers can be computed by using random sampling techniques similar
to those for high-dimensional volume estimation. When k>2 stocks are
considered, it is proved that a simple solution based on the same flow concepts

prescription, based on synchronicity (simultaneity) arguments, defines a
foliation of space-time, which corresponds to a family of canonically
associated observers. It provides also a natural global reference frame (with
space and time coordinates) for the observer, in space-time (or rather in the
part of it which is causally connected to him), which remains Minkowskian along
his world-line. This definition intends to provide a basis for the problem of
quantization in curved space-time, and/or for non inertial observers.
  Application to Mikowski space-time illustrates clearly the fact that
different observers see different spaces. It allows, for instance, to define
space everywhere without ambiguity, for the Langevin observer (involved in the
Langevin pseudoparadox of twins). Applied to the Rindler observer (with uniform
acceleration) it leads to the Rindler coordinates, whose choice is so justified
with a physical basis. This leads to an interpretation of the Unruh effect, as
due to the observer's dependence of the definition of space (and time). This
prescription is also applied in cosmology, for inertial observers in the
Friedmann - Lemaitre models: space for the observer appears to differ from the
hypersurfaces of homogeneity, which do not obey the simultaneity requirement. I
work out two examples: the Einstein - de Sitter model, in which space, for an
inertial observer, is not flat nor homogeneous, and the de Sitter case.

completely by linearised dynamics around a periodic orbit. This distribution
generalises the scarring theory of Kaplan [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 80}, 2582
(1998)] to describe the statistics of the components of the wavefunction in a
complete basis, rather than overlaps with single Gaussian wavepackets. In
particular it is shown that correlations in the components of the wavefunction
are present, which can strongly influence tunnelling-rate statistics. The

respect to covariance properties and existence of a stationary solution. The
master equation describes the interaction of a test particle with a quantum
fluid, the so-called Rayleigh gas, and is characterized by the appearance of a
two-point correlation function known as dynamic structure factor, which
reflects symmetry and statistical mechanics properties of the fluid. In the
case of a free gas all relevant physical parameters, such as fugacity, ratio
between the masses, momentum transfer and energy transfer are put into
evidence, giving an exact expansion of the dynamic structure factor. The limit
in which these quantities are small is then considered. In particular in the
Brownian limit a Fokker-Planck equation is obtained in which the corrections
due to quantum statistics can be explicitly evaluated and are given in terms of
the Bose function $g_0 (z)$ and the Fermi function $f_0 (z)$.

rules, its parameters are empirical, either deduced from classical physics, or
from experimental results rather than from the postulates. Thus, quantum
mechanics is purely phenomenological; for instance, the computation of the
eigenvalues of the energy is generally a simple interpolation in the discrete
space of the quantum numbers. The attempts to show that quantum electrodynamics
is more precise than classical electrodynamics are based on wrong computations.
The lack of paradoxes in the classical theory, the appearance of classical,
true interpretations of the wave-particle duality justify the criticism of
Ehrenfest and Einstein.
  The obscurity of the quantum concepts leads to wrong conclusions that
handicap the development of physics. Just as building a laser was considered
absurd before the first maser worked, the concept of photon leads to deny a
type of coherent Raman scattering necessary to understand some redshifts of
spectra in astrophysics, and able to destroy the two fundamental proofs to the
expansion of the universe.

algorithm with arbitrary unitary transformation and arbitrary phase rotations.
We show by an explicit expression that the phase matching condition depends
both on the unitary transformation U and the initial state. Assuming that the
initial amplitude distribution is an arbitrary superposition sin\theta_0 |1> +
cos\theta_0 e^{i\delta} |2> with |1> = {1 / sin\beta} \sum_k |\tau_k>
<\tau_k|U|0> and |2> = {1 / cos\beta} \sum_{i \ne \tau}|i> <i|U|0>, where
|\tau_k> is a marked state and \sin\beta = \sqrt{\sum_k|U_{\tau_k 0}|^2} is
determined by the matrix elements of unitary transformation U between |\tau_k>
and the |0> state, then the general phase matching condition is tan{\theta / 2}
[cos 2\beta + tan\theta_0 cos\delta sin 2\beta]= tan{\phi / 2} [1-tan\theta_0
sin\delta sin 2\beta tan{\theta / 2}], where \theta and \phi are the phase
rotation angles for |0> and |\tau_k>, respectively. This generalizes previous
conclusions in which the dependence of phase matching condition on $U$ and the
initial state has been disguised. We show that several phase conditions
previously discussed in the literature are special cases of this general one,
which clarifies the question of which condition should be regarded as exact.

on the spectrum of a quantum state and its reductions. Common examples are
entropic inequalities utilizing conditional Tsallis or Renyi entropies. We
prove that these inequalities are implied by the reduction criterion for any
positive value of the entropic parameters. We show however, that arbitrary sets
of criteria based on spectral and local information can never be sufficient by
establishing a separable, isospectral and locally undistinguishable counterpart
for any Werner state in odd dimensions. For the case of two qubit systems we
show that a simple controlled phase gate operation can produce an isospectral,
entangled state out of a separable one, which has the same reductions.

near its instantaneous ground state which tends to the solution [Farhi et al.,

Grover's problem, i. e., searching a marked item in an unstructured database.
We find that, by adjusting the evolution rate of the Hamiltonian so as to keep
the evolution adiabatic on each infinitesimal time interval, the total running
time is of order $\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of items in the database.
We thus recover the advantage of Grover's standard algorithm as compared to a
classical search, scaling as $N$. This is in contrast with the constant-rate
adiabatic approach developed by Farhi et al., where the requirement of
adiabaticity is expressed only globally, resulting in a time of order $N$.
