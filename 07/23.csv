measure weak gravitational shear from images of galaxies. We first characterize
the geometric space of shears and ellipticity, then use this geometric
interpretation to analyse images. The steps of this analysis include:
measurement of object shapes on images, combining measurements of a given
galaxy on different images, estimating the underlying shear from an ensemble of
galaxy shapes, and compensating for the systematic effects of image distortion,
bias from PSF asymmetries, and `""dilution"" of the signal by the seeing. These
methods minimize the ellipticity measurement noise, provide calculable shear
uncertainty estimates, and allow removal of systematic contamination by PSF
effects to arbitrary precision. Galaxy images and PSFs are decomposed into a
family of orthogonal 2d Gaussian-based functions, making the PSF correction and
shape measurement relatively straightforward and computationally efficient. We
also discuss sources of noise-induced bias in weak lensing measurements and
provide a solution for these and previously identified biases.

energy range of 1-100 MeV still manage to elude from detection by our
instruments, since their synchrotron emission is at too low frequencies. We
investigate a mechanism which can lead to observable emission of such electron
populations: synchrotron-self Comptonization (SSC). The inverse Compton (IC)
scattering can shift an otherwise unobservable low-frequency 10 kHz-10 MHz
photons into observable radio, infrared (IR) or even more energetic wave-bands.
The resulting emission should be polarized. We also consider IC scattering of
the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the cosmic radio background (CRB).
Electron spectral aging due to synchrotron, IC and adiabatic losses or gains
influences the resulting spectrum. The predicted radiation spectrum is a strong
function of the history of the source, of the low energy spectrum of
relativistic electrons, and of redshift. It has typically two maxima, and a
decrement in between at CMB frequencies. Detection will give a sensitive probe
of the environment of radio galaxies. We demonstrate that the fossil remnants
of powerful radio galaxies are promising detection candidates, especially when
they are embedded in a dense intra-cluster medium (ICM). GHz peaked sources
(GPS) have very low SSC luminosities, which may, however, extend into the X-ray
or even the gamma ray regime. Clusters of galaxies with relativistic electron
populations may be another detectable sources. Fossil radio plasma released by
our own Galaxy could be revealed by its large angular scale SSC flux. We
discuss the expected detectability of these sources with new and upcoming
instruments as LOFAR, GMRT, EVLA, ATA, ALMA, PLANCK, and HERSCHEL.

galaxies with cosmological models. A simple model of halo growth is provided by
Press-Schechter (PS) theory, where the initial field of density fluctuations is
smoothed using spherically symmetric filters centred on a given position to
obtain information about the likelihood of later collapse on varying scales. In
this paper the predicted halo mass growth is compared for three filter shapes:
Gaussian, top-hat and sharp k-space. Preliminary work is also presented
analysing the build-up of halos within numerical simulations using a
friends-of-friends group finder. The best-fit to the simulation mass function
was obtained using PS theory with a top-hat filter. By comparing both the
backwards conditional mass function, which gives the distribution of halo
progenitors, and the distribution of halo mergers in time, the build-up of
halos in the simulations is shown to be better fitted by PS theory with a sharp
k-space filter. This strengthens previous work, which also found the build-up
of halos in simulations to be well matched to PS theory with a sharp k-space
filter by providing a direct comparison of different filters and by extending
the statistical tools used to analyse halo mass growth. The usefulness of this
work is illustrated by showing that the cosmological evolution in the
proportion of halos that have undergone recent merger is predicted to be
independent of mass and power spectrum and to only depend upon cosmology.
Recent results from observations of field galaxies are shown to match the
evolution expected, but are not sufficiently accurate to usefully distinguish
between cosmological parameters.

  and J. Stocke, ASP Conf. Series",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In this contribution I summarize our current knowledge of the nature and
significance of starburst-driven galactic winds (``superwinds''). Superwinds
are complex multiphase outflows of cool, warm, and hot gas, dust, and
magnetized relativistic plasma. The observational manifestations of superwinds
result from the hydrodynamical interaction between the primary energy-carrying
wind fluid and the ambient interstellar medium. Superwinds are ubiquitous in
galaxies in which the global star-formation rate per unit area exceeds roughly
10$^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$. This criterion is met by local
starbursts and the high-z Lyman Break galaxies. Several independent datasets
and techniques imply that the total mass and energy outflow rates in a
superwind are comparable to the starburst's star-formation-rate and mechanical
energy injection rate, respectively. Outflow speeds in interstellar matter
entrained in the wind range from $\sim 10^2$ to $10^3$ km/s, but the primary
wind fluid itself may reach velocities as high as $\sim$3000 km s$^{-1}$. The
available X-ray and far-UV ($FUSE$) data imply that radiative losses in
superwinds are not significant. Superwinds may have established the
mass-metallicity relation in ellipticals and bulges, polluted the present-day
inter-galactic medium to a metallicity of $\sim$ 10 to 30% solar, heated the
inter-galactic medium, and ejected enough dust into the inter-galactic medium
to have potentially observable consequences.

depends more strongly on the intermolecular distance perpendicular to the
$\pi$-stacking chains than on that along the chains. This indicates that simple
single-chain models neglecting interchain electrostatic coupling are not
adequate. The gain of the Madelung energy due to dimerization is concluded to
be small compared with the other structural changes. We also calculated the
formation energy of excited state domains, which appear in the initial process
of the phase transition. A one-dimensional excited domain has the smallest
energy among the possible domains with the same number of molecules, and the

symmetry between fermions and bosons would be expected to do.
  However many obstacles seemed, long ago, to prevent supersymmetry from
possibly being a fundamental symmetry of Nature. Which fermions and bosons
could be related? Is spontaneous supersymmetry breaking possible at all? If
yes, where is the corresponding spin-1/2 Goldstone fermion? Supersymmetric
theories also involve Majorana fermions, unknown in Nature. And how could we
define conserved quantum numbers like B and L, when these are carried by
fundamental (Dirac) fermions only, not by bosons?
  An early attempt to relate the photon with a ``neutrino'' led us to
R-invariance and to a new R quantum number carried by the supersymmetry
generator, but this ``neutrino'' had to be reinterpreted as a new particle, the
photino. We also had to introduce bosons carrying ``fermion numbers'' B and L,
which became the squarks and sleptons. This led to the Supersymmetric Standard
Model, involving SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) gauge superfields interacting with chiral
quark and lepton superfields, and two doublet Higgs superfields responsible for
quark and lepton masses. R-parity, deeply related with B and L conservation
laws, appeared as a remnant of the original R-invariance, reduced to a discrete
symmetry so that the gravitino and gluinos can acquire masses. We also comment
about supersymmetry breaking.

Poisson manifolds, whose objects are integrable Poisson manifolds and whose
arrows are isomorphism classes of regular Weinstein dual pairs; it follows that
identity arrows are symplectic groupoids, and that two objects are isomorphic
in PO iff they are Morita equivalent in the sense of P. Xu. It has a
subcategory LPO that has duals of integrable Lie algebroids as objects and
cotangent bundles as arrows. We argue that naive C*-algebraic quantization
should be functorial from LPO to the well-known category KK, whose objects are
separable C*-algebras and whose arrows are Kasparov's KK-groups. This limited
functoriality of quantization would already imply the Atiyah-Singer index
theorem, as well as its far-reaching generalizations developed by Connes and
others. In the category KK, isomorphism of objects implies isomorphism of
K-theory groups, so that the functoriality of quantization on all of PO would
imply that Morita equivalent Poisson algebras are quantized by C*-algebras with
isomorphic K-theories. Finally, we argue that the correct codomain for the
possible functoriality of quantization is the category RKK(I), which takes the
deformation aspect of quantization into account.

  clarified",,"10.1063/1.1426231",,"physics.ins-det",,"  This paper describes a THz transmission spectrometer for the spectral range
of 2-65 cm^-1 (100 GHz to 2 THz) with a spectral resolution of at least 1.8
cm^-1 (50 GHz) where the source, sample, and detector are all fully contained
in a cryogenic environment. Cyclotron emission from a two-dimensional electron
gas heated with an electrical current serves as a magnetic field tunable
source. The spectrometer is demonstrated at 4.2 K by measuring the resonant
cyclotron absorption of a second two dimensional electron gas. Unique aspects
of the spectrometer are that 1) an ultra-broadband detector is used and 2) the
emitter is run quasi-continuously with a chopping frequency of only 1 Hz. Since
optical coupling to room temperature components is not necessary, this
technique is compatible with ultra-low temperature (sub 100 mK) operation.

A 65, 042316 (2002)","10.1103/PhysRevA.65.042316",,"quant-ph",,"  We study the remote implementation of a unitary transformation on a qubit. We
show the existence of non-trivial protocols (i.e., using less resources than
bidirectional state teleportation) which allow the perfect remote
implementation of certain continuous sets of quantum operations. We prove that,
up to a local change of basis, only two subsets exist that can be implemented
remotely with a non-trivial protocol: Arbitrary rotations around a fixed
direction $\vec{n}$ and rotations by a fixed angle around an arbitrary
direction lying in a plane orthogonal to $\vec{n}$. The overall classical
information and distributed entanglement cost required for the remote
implementation depends on whether it is a priori known to which of the two
teleportable subsets the transformation belongs to. If it is so, the optimal
protocol consumes one e-bit of entanglement and one c-bit in each direction. If
the subset is not known, two e-bits of entanglement need to be consumed while
the classical channel becomes asymmetric, two c-bits are conveyed from Alice to
Bob but only one from Bob to Alice.

d-dimensional quantum systems) by means of passive linear optical elements and
conditional measurements is discussed. A qudit is supposed to be represented by
d optical modes containing exactly one photon altogether. From recent results
of Calsamiglia it follows that there is no way how to distinguish the Bell
states of two qudits for d>2 - not even with the probability of success lower
than one - without any auxiliary photons in ancillary modes. Following the
results of Carollo and Palma it is proved that it is impossible to distinguish
even only one such a Bell state with certainty (i.e., with the probability of
success equal to one), irrespective of how many auxiliary photons are involved.
However, it is shown that auxiliary photons can help to discriminate the Bell
states of qudits with the high probability of success: A Bell-state analyzer
based on the idea of linear optics quantum computation that can achieve the
probability of success arbitrarily close to one is described. It requires many
auxiliary photons that must be first ""combined"" into entangled states.
