obtained through an R_C filter. The observations were carried out on seven
nights between December 1999 and February 2000, and have led to the discovery
of 7 new variable stars in the field. Three of them have been unambiguously
identified as W UMa-type eclipsing binaries, while two more are monoperiodic
pulsating stars, most probably high-amplitude delta Scuti-type variables. The
remaining two stars seem to be long-period eclipsing binaries without firm
period determination. Johnson B and V frames have been used to construct a new
colour-magnitude (CM) diagram of the cluster, and to find the locations of the
new variable stars. The pulsating variables are most likely background objects.
The CM diagram is fitted with recent isochrones yielding the main parameters of
the cluster.

  1st issue",,"10.1086/323133",,"astro-ph",,"  We explore the constraints on globular cluster formation provided by the
observed conditions in starbursts where globulars are currently forming, and by
the observed properties of young and old globular clusters. We note that the
pressure in the ISM of starbursts and mergers implies that molecular clouds in
these environments have radii similar to those of globular clusters. Such
molecular clouds are therefore viable precursors to globular clusters if the
star formation efficiency in the clouds is high. A high star formation
efficiency may be a consequence of the high density and associated high binding
energy and short dynamical timescale of molecular clouds in such environments.
We also note that the apparent lack of a mass-radius relationship in young and
old globular cluster systems places important constraints on globular cluster
formation models. This is because molecular clouds are observed to follow a
virial scaling relation between mass and radius. We suggest that a variable
star formation efficiency may weaken or eliminate the mass-radius relation of
molecular clouds as they fragment to form globular clusters. We attribute the
absence of young globular clusters in the disks of ordinary galaxies such as
the Milky Way to the relatively low ambient pressures in such systems.

in determining the distribution of the diffuse, X-ray emitting gas in clusters
of galaxies (ICM). The effect of non-gravitational processes is imprinted in
the ICM as an entropy minimum. Preheating models assume that the entropy
minimum is present in the cosmic baryons well before collapse. On the other
hand, observations of baryons in Ly_alpha clouds show only a modest extra
heating, ruling out the presence of such an entropy plateau in the majority of
low-density baryons at high z. The problem is avoided in the internal heating
scenario, where the heating occurs only inside virialized structures. However,
for internal heating the energy needed to build the entropy minimum is in
excess of 1 keV per particle. It is not clear which kind of source can heat the
baryons: SNae seem to be inefficient by a factor of 3 or more. This energy
crisis must be solved by other sources (like AGNs), unless we are missing some
key aspect of the heating mechanism. The main questions for the next years will
be: when and where is the excess entropy produced, and by which mechanism?

a power-law density distribution embedded in a plasma moving with relativistic
bulk speed we show that the observed radiation intensity is proportional to
D^(3+p), where D is the Doppler boosting factor, and p the electron
distribution index. This agrees with previous computations performed in the
Thomson limit, where the observed spectral index is a=(p-1)/2 and the beaming
pattern D^(4+2a). Independent of D, Klein-Nishina effects limit the location of
the peak energy of the observed spectral energy distribution such that e_{peak}
less than 1/e_0, where e_0 is the energy of the seed photons in units of mc^2.
Assuming that the seed photons originate in the broad line region, we
demonstrate that the GeV emission of blazars is significantly modified by
Klein-Nishina effects, the spectrum being softer than that calculated in the
Thomson limit. We further show that the change in spectral index of the inverse
Compton emission across the peak energy can exceed the value of 0.5 predicted
by computations performed in the Thomson limit. The model spectra agree with
OSSE and COMPTEL limits on this break without invoking the effects of
differential absorption at the edge of a gamma-ray photosphere.

the scatter seen in element-to-iron ratios of metal-poor halo stars are heavily
dependent on theoretical nucleosynthesis yields of core-collapse supernovae.
Hence inhomogeneous models present themselves as a test for stellar nucleosyn-
thesis calculations. Applying an inhomogeneous chemical evolution model to our
Galaxy reveals a number of shortcomings of existing theoretical nucleosynthesis
yields. One problem is the predicted scatter in [O/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] which is too
large compared to the one observed in metal-poor halo stars. This can be either
due to the O or Mg yields or due to the Fe yields (or both). However, O and Mg
are alpha-elements that are produced mainly during hydrostatic burning and thus
are not affected by the theoretical uncertainties afflicting the collapse and
explosion of a massive star. Stellar iron yields, on the other hand, depend
heavily on the choice of the mass-cut between ejecta and proto neutron star and
are therefore very uncertain. We present Fe yield distributions as function of
progenitor mass that are consistent with the abundance distribution of metal-
poor halo stars and are in agreement with observed Ni yields of SNe II with
known progenitor masses. The iron yields of lower-mass SNe II (in the range
10-20 Msol) are well constrained by those observations. Present observations,
however, do not allow to determine a unique solution for higher-mass SNe.
Nevertheless, the main dependence of the stellar iron yield as function of
progenitor mass may be derived and can be used as constraint for future
supernova/hypernova models. The results are of importance for the earliest
stages of galaxy formation when the ISM is dominated by chemical
inhomogeneities and the instantaneous mixing approximation is not valid.

These parts of the article should be readily accessible to students with a
background in quantum mechanics including second quantization. To illustrate
the usefulness of the methods presented, the current-voltage relation is
determined exactly for a spin-polarized quantum wire with a particular value of
the interaction parameter. This part requires familiarity with path integral

projected out by the GSO projections, while leaving the electroweak doublets in
the physical spectrum. The connection with the higher dimensional theories is
elucidated. It is shown that the doublet-triplet splitting depends crucially on
the assignment of boundary conditions in the compactified directions.

potential. This can be further rewritten as a minimally coupled scalar with the
Liouville-type potential in the Einstein frame. However this model fails to
induce the quintessence on the dilatonic domain wall because the potential is
negative. Second we consider the 4D gravity with the dilaton. In this case we
find also a negative potential. Any negative potential gives us negative energy
density and positive pressure, which does not lead to an accelerating universe.
Consequently it turns out that the zero mode approach of the dilatonic domain
wall cannot accommodate the quintessence in cosmology.

explore the possible (target) spacetime symmetries that may appear in a matrix
description of de Sitter gravity. Such symmetry groups could arise in two ways,
one from an ``IMF'' like construction and the other from a ``DLCQ'' like
construction. In contrast to the flat space case, we show that the two
constructions will lead to different groups, i.e. the Newton-Hooke group and
the inhomogeneous Euclidean group (or its algebraic cousins). It is argued that
matrix quantum mechanics based on the former symmetries look more plausible.
Then, after giving a detailed description of the relevant one particle
dynamics, a concrete Newton-Hooke matrix model is proposed. The model naturally
incorporates issues such as holography, UV-IR relations, and fuzziness, for
gravity in $dS_{4}$. We also provide evidence to support a possible phase
transition. The lower temperature phase, which corresponds to gravity in the
perturbative regime, has a Hilbert space of infinite dimension. In the higher
temperature phase where the perturbation theory breaks down, the dimension of
the Hilbert space may become finite.

the original system and so with symmetries of the original Lagrangian. We cast
our approach in an intrinsic coordinate free formulation. Our results can be of
