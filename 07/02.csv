continuous merging processes in the hierarchical clustering universe. While
such a time-variation is significant in a relatively local patch of the

the ratio of the [OI]63um flux to FIR does not show a systematic trend with the

increase with the color. We estimate the physical conditions of
photodissociation regions (PDRs) in the sample galaxies, such as the

that all the observed [OI]63um and far-infrared continuum emissions come from
PDRs. The present analysis suggests that the decrease in [CII]158um/FIR with
the far-infrared color may not be accounted for by the decrease in the
photoelectric heating efficiency owing to the increase in positive charges of
dust grains because a measure of the efficiency, Go/n, is found to stay
constant with the far-infrared color. Instead the decrease can be interpreted
in terms of either the increase in the collisional de-excitation of the [CII]
transition due to the increase in the gas density or the decrease in the
ionized component relative to the far-infrared intensity suggested by the
decrease in [NII]122um/FIR. Based on the present analysis, we derive average

from ESO-NTT optical (I, V-I) photometry of three nearby, Local Group,
galaxies: the Sculptor Dwarf Spheroidal, the Fornax Dwarf Spheroidal and the
Dwarf Irregular NGC 6822. The summed equivalent width of the two strongest
lines in the Ca II triplet absorption line feature, centered at 8500A, can be
readily converted into an [Fe/H] abundance using the previously established
calibrations by Armandroff & Da Costa (1991) and Rutledge, Hesser & Stetson
(1997). We measured metallicities for 37 stars in Sculptor, 32 stars in Fornax,
and 23 stars in NGC 6822, yielding more precise estimates of the metallicity
distribution functions for these galaxies than it is possible to obtain
photometrically. In the case of NGC 6822, this is the first direct measurement
of the abundances of the intermediate-age and old stellar populations. We find
metallicity spreads in each galaxy which are broadly consistent with the
photometric width of the Red Giant Branch, although the abundances of
individual stars do not always appear to correspond to their colour. This is
almost certainly predominantly due to a highly variable star formation rate
with time in these galaxies, which results in a non-uniform,
non-globular-cluster-like, evolution of the Ca/Fe ratio.

significantly high (> 10^7 cm^-3), also exhibit the same tendency. On the other
hand, the emission-line flux ratios among low-ionization emission lines do not
show such a tendency. We point out that the most plausible interpretation of
these results is that the high-ionization emission lines arise mainly from
highly-ionized, dense gas clouds, which are located very close to nuclei, and
thus can be hidden by dusty tori. To examine the physical properties of these
highly-ionized dense gas clouds, photoionization model calculations were
performed. As a result, we find that the hydrogen density and the ionization
parameter of these highly-ionized dense gas clouds are constrained to be n_H >

the formation of stable molecules throughout the crystal, while the latter
tends to break this correlated state. We determine in both cases the minimizing
orbital solutions for various spin configurations, and draw the corresponding

the real spin structure presents an orbital ordering compatible with the

small excitation energy in two distinct regions of the phase space, which might
turn into the true ground state of V_2O_3 due to the favorable coupling with

an average number of topplings (\Delta) spread over a radial distance (\xi). We

We find the model to display a magnetic order-disorder transition in the U-J
plane with a critical value of J_c which is decreasing as a function of U. The
single particle spectral function A(k,w) is computed across this transition.
For all values of J > 0, and apart from shadow features present in the ordered
state, A(k,w) remains insensitive to the magnetic phase transition with the
first low-energy hole states residing at momenta k = (\pm \pi, \pm \pi). As J
-> 0 the model maps onto the Hubbard Hamiltonian. Only in this limit, the
low-energy spectral weight at k = (\pm \pi, \pm \pi) vanishes with first
electron removal-states emerging at wave vectors on the magnetic Brillouin zone
boundary. Thus, we conclude that (i) the local screening of impurity spins

an iteration of reduction functions over a domain. He has also demonstrated the

We introduce here a set of operators for modeling compositions of reduction
functions. Two of the major goals are to tackle parallel computations, and

  It is shown that there is invariantly definable singular behaviour beyond the
one displayed by the Kretschmann scalar when a unique, hypersurface orthogonal,
timelike Killing vector exists. In this case, a particle can be defined to be
at rest when its world-line is a corresponding Killing orbit. The norm of the
acceleration on such an orbit proves to be singular not only for metrics that
deviate from Schwarzschild's metric, but also on approaching the horizon of

investigated. We carry out numerical simulations in the quenched approximation
at three values of lattice spacing ($a_{\sigma}^{-1}=1$--2 GeV) with the
anisotropy $\xi=a_{\sigma}/a_{\tau}=4$, where $a_{\sigma}$ and $a_{\tau}$ are
the spatial and the temporal lattice spacings, respectively. The bare
anisotropy $\gamma_F$ in the quark field action is numerically tuned by the
dispersion relation of mesons so that the renormalized fermionic anisotropy
coincides with that of gauge field. This calibration of bare anisotropy is
performed to the level of 1 % statistical accuracy in the quark mass region
below the charm quark mass. The systematic uncertainty in the calibration is
estimated by comparing the results from different types of dispersion
relations, which results in 3 % on our coarsest lattice and tends to vanish in
the continuum limit. In the chiral limit, there is an additional systematic
uncertainty of 1 % from the chiral extrapolation.
  Taking the central value $\gamma_F=\gamma_F^*$ from the result of the
calibration, we compute the light hadron spectrum. Our hadron spectrum is
consistent with the result by UKQCD Collaboration on the isotropic lattice. We
also study the response of the hadron spectrum to the change of anisotropic
parameter, $\gamma_F \to \gamma_F^* + \delta\gamma_F$. We find that the change
of $\gamma_F$ by 2 % induces a change of 1 % in the spectrum for physical quark
masses. Thus the systematic uncertainty on the anisotropic lattice, as well as
the statistical one, is under control.

radiative-type stresses induced by 5-dimensional graviton effects. Standard

these 5-dimensional graviton effects. We find an exact uniform-density stellar
solution on the brane, and show that the general relativity upper bound
$GM/R<{4\over9}$ is reduced by 5-dimensional high-energy effects. The existence
of neutron stars leads to a constraint on the brane tension that is stronger
than the big bang nucleosynthesis constraint, but weaker than the Newton-law
experimental constraint. We present two different non-Schwarzschild exteriors
that match the uniform-density star on the brane, and we give a uniqueness
conjecture for the full 5-dimensional problem.

deformation if there is a finite sequence of collapse and expansion moves

characterizations, in terms of dynamics, coarse geometry, and length functions.
Next we study the deformation space of a fixed G-tree X. We show that if X is
`strongly slide-free' then it is the unique reduced tree in its deformation
space.
  These methods allow us to extend the rigidity theorem of Bass and Lubotzky to
trees that are not locally finite. This yields a unique factorization theorem
for certain graphs of groups. We apply the theory to generalized
Baumslag-Solitar groups and show that many have canonical decompositions. We
also prove a quasi-isometric rigidity theorem for strongly slide-free G-trees.

branch of the theory of graphical statics developed by Maxwell and his

which constitute the simplest pair of reciprocal figures representing both a
framework and a self-stress encapsulate the integrable discrete BKP equation
and its Schwarzian version. The inherent Moebius invariant nature of the
Schwarzian BKP equation is then exploited to define reciprocity in an inversive
geometric setting. Integrable pairs of lattices of non-trivial combinatorics
consisting of reciprocal triangles and their natural generalizations are
discussed. Particular reductions of these BKP lattices are related to the
integrable discrete versions of Darboux's 2+1-dimensional sine-Gordon equation
and the classical Tzitzeica equation of affine geometry. Furthermore, it is
shown that octahedral figures and their hexahedral reciprocals as considered by
