several candidate magnetic white dwarfs that were identified during the
Hamburg/ESO survey for bright QSOs. HE 1211-1707 and HE 1043-0502 are rare
examples of white dwarfs that show neutral helium lines in a high magnetic
field, in these cases ~50 MG and ~800 MG, respectively. The former is also
found to be rotating with a period of ~2 hr. HE 1045-0908 is a hydrogen-line
star at ~20 MG, spinning with a period in the range ~2-4 hr. Attempts at
modeling the limited amount of phase-resolved data that is available suggest
that the field structure departs substantially from a simple centered dipolar
geometry. Two rather cool white dwarfs with unidentified broad absorption
spectral features, HE 0236-2656 and HE 0330-0002, are confirmed to be magnetic.
Line identifications for these stars are not yet possible, but the atmospheres
are probably helium-rich, with spectral features formed by trace compounds of
hydrogen, carbon, and perhaps other metals. HE 0003-5701 and HE 0338-3853 were
proposed by Reimers et al. (1996) alongside two similar objects to be magnetic
DB white dwarfs, with magnetic fields all near 20 MG. However, our observations
show that the first two, and by extension all four, are nonmagnetic white dwarf
+ cool dwarf pairs, deserving of study in their own right as possible close
binaries. Finally, a lack of circular polarisation suggests that HE 0000-3430
and HE 0127-3110 are also nonmagnetic. HE 0000-3430 appears to be a featureless
DC white dwarf over the spectral range observed here, while the sole absorption
line near 5890A in HE 0127-3110 could be either He I 5876A or the Na I D
doublet, but there are difficulties with either interpretation.

between the velocity centroids of the Lyman alpha forest lines were found to be
less than about 400 m/s, for unsaturated absorption lines with column densities
in the range 12<log N(HI)<14.13. The rate of energy transfer into the low
density IGM on a typical scale of 100 pc seems to be lower by 3-4 orders of
magnitude than the rate measured earlier for strong CIV metal absorption
systems. The tight correlation between HI column density and baryonic density
in the intergalactic medium was used to obtain an upper limit on the RMS
fluctuations of the baryonic density field. The fraction of the absorption
lines that are different across the lines of sight was used to determine the
filling factor of the universe for gas which has suffered recent hydrodynamic

perturb the smooth lensing light curve created by the primary lens. However, it
was shown by Gaudi that a subset of binary-source events can produce light
curves that closely resemble those produced by a significant fraction of
planet/star lens systems, causing serious contamination of a sample of
suspected planetary systems detected via microlensing. In this paper, we show
that if a lensing event is observed astrometrically, one can unambiguously
break the photometric degeneracy between binary-source and planetary lensing
perturbations. This is possible because while the planet-induced perturbation
in the trajectory of the lensed source image centroid shifts points away from
the opening of the unperturbed elliptical trajectory, while the perturbation
induced by the binary source companion points always towards the opening.
Therefore, astrometric microlensing observations by using future high-precision

  We confirm that the ultra-relativistic equivalent of Fermi acceleration at a

In the rest frame of the upstream fluid, particles can only outrun the shock

curves and variability duty cycles of AGNs. We model the properties of AGN
light curves at radio wavelengths using a simulated shot noise process in which
the occurrence of major flaring events in a relativistic jet is governed by
Poisson statistics. We show that flaring sources whose radiation is highly
beamed toward us are able to reach very high flux levels, but will in fact
spend most of their time in relatively low flaring states due to relativistic
contraction of flare time scales in the observer frame. The fact that highly
beamed AGNs do not return to a steady-state quiescent level between flares
implies that their weakly beamed counterparts should have highly stable flux
densities that result from a superposition of many long-term, low-amplitude
flares. The ``apparent'' quiescent flux levels of these weakly beamed AGNs
(identified in many unified models as radio galaxies) will be significantly
higher than their ''true'' quiescent (i.e., non-flaring) levels. We use Monte
Carlo simulations to investigate flux variability bias in the selection
statistics of flat-spectrum AGN samples. In the case of the Caltech-Jodrell
Flat-spectrum survey, the predicted orientation bias towards jets seen end-on
is weakened if the parent population is variable, since the highly beamed
sources have a stronger tendency to be found in low flaring states. This effect
is small, however, since highly beamed sources are relatively rare, and their
fluxes tend to be boosted sufficiently above the survey limit such that they
are selected regardless of their flaring level. We find that for larger
flat-spectrum AGN surveys with fainter flux cutoffs, variability should not be
an appreciable source of selection bias.

materials, proposed by us in an earlier paper, has been used to analyze plane
and cylindrical Couette flow. In this model, the hydrodynamic fields of a
classical continuum are supplemented by the couple stress and the intrinsic
angular velocity fields. The balance of angular momentum, which is satisfied
implicitly in a classical continuum, must be enforced in a Cosserat continuum.
As a result, the stress tensor could be asymmetric, and the angular velocity of
a material point may differ from half the local vorticity. An important
consequence of treating the granular medium as a Cosserat continuum is that it
incorporates a material length scale in the model, which is absent in
frictional models based on a classical continuum. Further, the Cosserat model
allows determination of the velocity fields uniquely in viscometric flows, in
contrast to classical frictional models. Experiments on viscometric flows of
dense, slowly deforming granular materials indicate that shear is confined to a
narrow region, usually a few grain diameters thick, while the remaining
material is largely undeformed. This feature is captured by the present model,
and the velocity profile predicted for cylindrical Couette flow is in good
agreement with reported data. When the walls of the Couette cell are smoother
than the granular material, the model predicts that the shear layer thickness
is independent of the Couette gap $H$ when the latter is large compared to the
grain diameter $d_p$. When the walls are of the same roughness as the granular
material, the model predicts that the shear layer thickness varies as
$(H/d_p)^{1/3}$ in the limit $(H/d_p) \gg 1$, for plane shear under gravity and
cylindrical Couette flow.

on two vector fields, defined on a manifold, and also that the gravitational
Lagrangian depends on the metric tensor and its first and second differentials
(instead on the partial or covariant derivatives, as usually assumed).
  Assuming also different operators of variation and differentiation, it has
been shown that the first variation of the gravitational Lagrangian can be
represented as a third-rank polynomial in respect to the variables, defined in
terms of the variated or differentiated vector fields. Therefore, the solution
of the variational problem is found to be equivalent to finding all the
variables - elements of an algebraic variety, which satisfy the algebraic
equation.

Perturbation Theory (APT) for analysis of some QCD observables. We start with
the discussion of the main problem of the perturbative QCD -- ghost
singularities and with the resume of this trouble solution within the APT.
  By a few examples in the various energy and momentum transfer regions (with
the flavor number f=3, 4 and 5) we demonstrate the effect of improved
convergence of the APT modified perturbative QCD expansion. Our first
observation is that in the APT analysis the three-loop contribution $\sim
\alpha_s^3$) is as a rule numerically inessential. This gives raise a hope for
practical solution of the well-known problem of asymptotic nature of common QFT
perturbation series.
  The second result is that a usual perturbative analysis of time-like events
with the big $\pi^2$ term in the $\alpha_s^3$ coefficient is not adequate at
$s\leq 2 \GeV^2$. In particular, this relates to $\tau$ decay.
  Then, for the ""high"" (f=5) region it is shown that the common two-loop (NLO,
NLLA) perturbation approximation widely used there (at $10
\GeV\lesssim\sqrt{s}\lesssim 170 \GeV$) for analysis of shape/events data
contains a systematic negative error of a 1--2 per cent level for the extracted
$\bar{alpha}_s^{(2)} $ values.
  Our physical conclusion is that the $\bar{alpha}_s(M^2_Z)$ value averaged
over the f=5 data appreciably differs $<bar{alpha}_s(M^2_Z)>_{f=5}\simeq 0.124$

turbines. If, however, a homogeneous and stationary state has the property that
no cycle can perform more work than an ideal windmill, then it can be shown
that there is some inertial frame where the state is a thermodynamic
equilibrium state. This provides a covariant characterization of thermodynamic
equilibrium states.
  In the absence of matter, cycles should perform work only when driven by
nonstationary inertial forces caused by the observer's motion. If a pure state
of a relativistic quantum field theory behaves this way, it satisfies the

and K. A. H. van Leeuwen, Phys. Rep. {\bf 255}, 289 (1995)) depend only weakly
on the angular momentum of the atoms in the initial microcanonical ensemble,
but strongly on the principal quantum number and the magnetic quantum number.
Based on this insight, coupled with the computational power of a high-end
60-node Beowulf PC cluster, we present the first 3D quantum calculations of
microwave ionization curves in the experimentally relevant parameter regime.

field in quantum formalism. We demonstrate that by choosing a number field for
a linear space representation of quantum model it is possible to describe
various interference phenomena. We analyse interference of probabilistic
alternatives induced by real, complex, hyperbolic (Clifford) and p-adic
representations.

Williams","Quantum Logic for Trapped Atoms via Molecular Hyperfine Interactions","Submitted to Physical Review A",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.65.022313",,"quant-ph",,"  We study the deterministic entanglement of a pair of neutral atoms trapped in
an optical lattice by coupling to excited-state molecular hyperfine potentials.
Information can be encoded in the ground-state hyperfine levels and processed
by bringing atoms together pair-wise to perform quantum logical operations
through induced electric dipole-dipole interactions. The possibility of
executing both diagonal and exchange type entangling gates is demonstrated for
two three-level atoms and a figure of merit is derived for the fidelity of
entanglement. The fidelity for executing a CPHASE gate is calculated for two
87Rb atoms, including hyperfine structure and finite atomic localization. The
main source of decoherence is spontaneous emission, which can be minimized for
interaction times fast compared to the scattering rate and for sufficiently
separated atomic wavepackets. Additionally, coherent couplings to states
outside the logical basis can be constrained by the state dependent trapping
potential.

i.e. the energy is liberated since the particles of the different charges are

levels of electrons. The expressions describing these velocity changes and
displacement of energy levels of electrons in the atom are obtained.

D 17 (2001) 399-408","10.1007/s100530170014",,"quant-ph",,"  Thermal noise of a mirror can be reduced by cold damping. The displacement is
measured with a high-finesse cavity and controlled with the radiation pressure
of a modulated light beam. We establish the general quantum limits of noise in
cold damping mechanisms and we show that the optomechanical system allows to
reach these limits. Displacement noise can be arbitrarily reduced in a narrow
frequency band. In a wide-band analysis we show that thermal fluctuations are
reduced as with classical damping whereas quantum zero-point fluctuations are
left unchanged. The only limit of cold damping is then due to zero-point energy
of the mirror
