  Journal, November 2001",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present deep color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for a field along the outer
disk of M31 based on archival Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary
Camera 2 observations in the F555W (~V) and F814W (~I) filters. The CMDs, which
contain a total of about 50,000 stars, feature a prominent red giant branch
(RGB) along with a significant population of helium burning red clump stars. In
addition, they exhibit the rarely seen asymptotic giant branch clump as well as
a weak `Pop II' horizontal branch. There is also the hint of a ~2 Gyr subgiant
branch at the faintest levels of the CMDs. After adopting an M31 distance of
(m-M)o = 24.5 and a reddening of E(B-V) = 0.08, we draw the following
conclusions. 1) The I-band absolute magnitude of the helium burning red clump
stars is M(RC) = -0.29 +/- 0.05, which is in accord with the value derived from
Hipparcos parallaxes of solar neighborhood clump stars by Stanek & Garnavich.
2) The metallicity distribution function constructed from bright RGB stars
shows a characteristic shape; however, a pure halo population consisting of
metal-poor and intermediate metallicity components (as advocated in the
literature) are not sufficient to account for this shape. Instead, an
additional Gaussian component with <[Fe/H]> = -0.22 +/- 0.26, comprising 70% of
the total number of stars, is required. 3) A comparison of our CMD with
theoretical isochrones indicates that the majority of stars in our M31 field
have ages that are >~1.5 Gyr. 4) These points, along with the physical location
of our field in M31, suggest that we are observing the thick disk population of

  Medium","ApJ, in press, 5 color figures",,"10.1086/323967",,"astro-ph",,"  (Abridged) We present the results of three dimensional calculations for the
MHD evolution of an adiabatic supernova remnant in both a uniform and turbulent
interstellar medium using the RIEMANN framework of Balsara. In the uniform
case, which contains an initially uniform magnetic field, the density structure
of the shell remains largely spherical, while the magnetic pressure and
synchrotron emissivity are enhanced along the plane perpendicular to the field
direction. This produces a bilateral or barrel-type morphology in synchrotron
emission for certain viewing angles. We then consider a case with a turbulent
external medium as in Balsara & Pouquet, characterized by $v_{A}(rms)/c_{s}=2$.
Several important changes are found. First, despite the presence of a uniform
field, the overall synchrotron emissivity becomes approximately spherically
symmetric, on the whole, but is extremely patchy and time-variable, with
flickering on the order of a few computational time steps. We suggest that the
time and spatial variability of emission in early phase SNR evolution provides
information on the turbulent medium surrounding the remnant. The
shock-turbulence interaction is also shown to be a strong source of
helicity-generation and, therefore, has important consequences for magnetic
field generation. We compare our calculations to the Sedov-phase evolution, and
discuss how the emission characteristics of SNR may provide a diagnostic on the
nature of turbulence in the pre-supernova environment.

Survey. By comparing clustering properties parallel and perpendicular to the
line of sight and by modeling the effects of redshift space distortions, we are
able to study geometric distortions in the clustering pattern which occur if a
wrong cosmology is assumed when translating redshifts into comoving distances.
  Using mock 2QZ catalogues, drawn from the Hubble Volume simulation, we find,
that there is a degeneracy between the geometric and the redshift-space
distortions that makes it difficult to obtain an unambiguous estimate of
Omega_{m}(0) from the geometric tests alone. However, we demonstrate a new
method to determine the cosmology which works by combining the above geometric
test with a test based on the evolution of the QSO clustering amplitude. We
find that we are able to break the degeneracy and that independent constraints
to +-20% (1 sigma) accuracy on Omega_{m}(0) and +-10% (1 sigma) accuracy on
beta_{QSO}(z) should be possible in the full 2QZ survey.
  Finally we apply the method to the 10k catalogue of 2QZ QSOs. The smaller
number of QSOs and the current status of the Survey mean that a strong result
on cosmology is not possible but we do constrain beta_{QSO}(z) to 0.35+-0.2. By
combining this constraint with the further constraint available from the
amplitude of QSO clustering, we find tentative evidence favouring a model with
non-zero Omega_{Lambda}(0), although an Omega_{m}(0)=1 model provides only a
marginally less good fit. A model with Omega_{Lambda}(0)=1 is ruled out. The
results are in agreement with those found by Outram et al. using a similar

its orientation, the point-source gain, the integrated gain (or, equivalently,
the main beam efficiency); for the other Stokes parameters the beam parameters

sidelobe's fractional polarization.
  We illustrate the technique by applying it to the Arecibo telescope. The main
beam width is smaller and the sidelobe levels higher than for a
uniformly-illuminated aperture of the same effective area. These effects are
modeled modestly well by a blocked aperture, with the blocked area equal to
about 10% of the effective area (this corresponds to 5% physical blockage). In
polarized emission, the effects of beam squint (difference in pointing
direction between orthogonal polarizations) and squash (difference in beamwidth
between orthogonal polarizations) do not correspond to theoretical expectation
and are higher than expected; these effects are almost certainly caused by the
blockage. The first sidelobe is highly polarized because of blockage.

assessed against those of the Mt. Wilson stars, open cluster stars, and
evolutionary stellar models that include rotation. They appear to be normal,
modulo certain inconsistencies in various necessary inputs. Selection of
candidate planet hosts for radial velocity surveys by low rotation or activity
has resulted in a planet host sample skewed towards older stars. Thus,
cross-comparisons must be age dependent. However, self-consistent ages are
difficult to obtain, and activity ages show signs of systematic errors. There
are indications that activity ages ought to be increased for
lower-than-solar-mass stars and decreased for higher-than-solar-mass stars. Age
uncertainties and a scarcity of measured rotation periods for planet host stars
inflate the dispersion in older stars relative to those in open clusters. The
presently available rotational models display inadequacies, most notably in
producing fast-enough early-type stars. The fact that only one planet host
star, $\tau Boo$, strongly suggests tidal spin-up, while of order ten systems
suggest orbital circularization is explicable in terms of the differing
timescales for these two phenomena. The rotational normalcy of the planet host
stars and other considerations suggest that they are not especially different
from other main sequence stars and that circumstellar matter and/or planets are
probably ubiquitous, at least among sufficiently metal-rich solar-type stars.

The intrinsic cosmic scatter of Mbar_K appears to be larger than that of I-band
SBFs. The discovery of a correlation between K-band SBFs and V-I color is a new
clue into the star formation histories of early-type galaxies. This relation
naturally accounts for galaxies previously claimed to have anomalously bright

scatter in metallicity may also be present. The youngest ages imply some

bright K-band SBFs, perhaps originating from a high metallicity burst of star
formation in the last few Gyr. The increased spread and brightening of the

is a kinematically distinct, flattened, halo population at the more than 99%

indistinguishable in terms of luminosity, color and apparent age (1-10 Gyr).

dispersions of sigma_U=62(+8/-10) km/s and 150(+80/-40) km/s (90% C.L.) for the

compare our spectra (R ~ 2000) of these two features with a simple model of
Neptune's atmosphere. Given our model assumption that the clouds are flat
reflecting layers, we find that the top of the bright southern cloud feature
sat at a pressure level of 0.14 (+0.05, -0.03) bar, and thus this cloud did not
extend into the stratosphere (P < 0.1 bar). A similar analysis of the dimmer
northern feature gives a cloud-top pressure of 0.084 +/- 0.026 bar. This
suggests that the features we observed efficiently transport methane to the
base of the stratosphere, but do not directly transport methane to the upper
stratosphere (P < 0.01-0.001 bar) where photolysis occurs. Our observations do
not constrain how far these clouds penetrate down into the troposphere. We find
that our model fits to the data restrict the fraction of molecular hydrogen in
ortho/para thermodynamic equilibrium to greater than 0.8.

luminous X-ray binaries preferentially form in GCs. Many of the GC sources have
super-Eddington luminosities (for an accreting neutron star) and their average
luminosity is higher than the non-GC sources. The X-ray spectral properties of
both GC and non-GC sources are similar to those of LMXBs in our Galaxy. Two of
the brightest sources, one of which is in a GC, have an ultra-soft spectrum,
similar to that seen in the high state of black hole candidates. The
``apparent'' super-Eddington luminosity in many cases may be due to multiple

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in the conical-ejection fireball scenarios. We argue
that, instead, recent observations imply that the long-duration GRBs and their
afterglows are produced by highly relativistic jets of cannonballs (CBs)
emitted in supernova explosions. The CBs are heated by their collision with the
supernova shell. The GRB is the boosted surface radiation the CBs emit as they
reach the transparent outskirts of the shell. The exiting CBs further
decelerate by sweeping up interstellar matter (ISM). The early X-ray afterglow
is dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung from the cooling CBs, the optical
afterglow by synchrotron radiation from the ISM electrons swept up by the CBs.
We show that this model fits simply and remarkably well all the measured
optical afterglows of the 15 GRBs with known redshift, including that of GRB
990123, for which unusually prompt data are available. We demonstrate that GRB
980425 was a normal GRB produced by SN1998bw, with standard X-ray and optical
afterglows. We find that the very peculiar afterglow of GRB 970508 can be
explained if its CBs encountered a significant jump in density as they moved
through the ISM. The afterglows of the nearest 8 of the known-redshift GRBs
show various degrees of evidence for an association with a supernova akin to
SN1998bw. In all other cases such an association, even if present, would have
been undetectable with the best current photometric sensitivities. This gives
strong support to the proposition that most, maybe all, of the long-duration
GRBs are associated with supernovae. Though our emphasis is on optical
afterglows, we also provide an excellent description of X-ray afterglows.

concentrated on the reaction flow of heavy unstable nuclei. Although the
nuclear reaction network includes a few thousand heavy nuclei, only limited
reaction flow through light-mass nuclei near the stability line has been used
in those studies. However, in a viable scenario of the r-process in
neutrino-driven winds, the initial condition is a high-entropy hot plasma
consisting of neutrons, protons, and electron-positron pairs experiencing an
intense flux of neutrinos. In such environments light-mass nuclei as well as
heavy nuclei are expected to play important roles in the production of seed
nuclei and r-process elements. Thus, we have extended our fully implicit
nuclear reaction network so that it includes all nuclei up to the neutron drip
line for Z $ \leq 10$, in addition to a larger network for Z $ \geq 10$. In the
present nucleosynthesis study, we utilize a wind model of massive SNeII
explosions to study the effects of this extended network. We find that a new
nuclear-reaction flow path opens in the very light neutron-rich region. This
new nuclear reaction flow can change the final heavy-element abundances by as
much as an order of magnitude.

GRBs; this is generally explained by the jet model. However, there are still
some uncertainties concerning this interpretation due to the unclear
hydrodynamics of jet sideways expansion. Here we propose an alternative
explanation to these observed breaks. If we assume that the multiwavelength
spectra of GRB afterglows are not made of exact power law segments but their
slope changes smoothly, i.e. $d\beta/d log\nu<0$, where $\beta$ is the spectral
index, we find that this fact can very nicely explain the afterglow light
curves showing breaks. Therefore we suggest that some breaks in the afterglow
light curves may be caused by their curved spectra. The main feature of this
interpretation is that the break time is dependent on the observed frequency,
while the jet model produces achromatic breaks in the light curves. In
addition, it is very important to know the position of the characteristic
frequency $\nu_{c}$ in the multiwavelength spectrum at the time of the break,
since it is a further discriminant between our model and the jet model. We find
that although the optical light curves of seven GRB afterglows can be well
fitted by the model we propose, in fact only one of them (i.e. GRB000926) can
be explained in this framework, since for other ones the characteristic
frequency $\nu_{c}$ is either above the optical after the break or below the
optical before the break.

presence of the ionized Fe K-alpha line detected by ASCA and to test the
presence of reflection from ionized material. The best self-consistent spectral
fit is obtained when including a contribution from a mildly ionized reflector
(Xi(0.01-100) ~ 1625 erg cm s-1, i.e. U(0.1-10) ~ 0.14) with a reflection
fraction R_ion ~ 0.11. An exponential cut-off to the direct power-law continuum
is then required at E ~ 100 keV. The low energy spectrum is absorbed by ionized
matter with a column density N_W = (8.1 (-1.2/+2.1))*10^21 cm^-2 and an X-ray
ionization parameter U(0.1-10)= 0.06 +/- 0.01. The warm absorber column is

comprehensive to date, is used to investigate the distribution of HI in the

with that of field galaxies by measuring HI mass-to-light ratios and the HI
deficiency parameter of Solanes et al. (1996). The mean HI mass-to-light ratio
of the cluster galaxies is 0.68+/-0.15, significantly lower than for a sample
of HI-selected field galaxies (1.15+/-0.10), although not as low as in the
Virgo cluster (0.45+/-0.03). The mean HI deficiency for the cluster is
0.38+/-0.09 (for T=1-6), significantly greater than for the field sample
(0.05+/-0.03). Both these tests show that Fornax cluster galaxies are
HI-deficient compared to field galaxies. The kinematics of the cluster galaxies
suggests that the HI deficiency may be caused by ram-pressure stripping of
galaxies on orbits that pass close to the cluster core.
  We also derive the most complete B-band TF relation of inclined spiral
galaxies in Fornax. A subcluster in the South-West of the main cluster
contributes considerably to the scatter. The scatter for galaxies in the main
cluster alone is 0.50mag, which is slightly larger than the intrinsic scatter
of 0.4mag. We use the TF relation to derive a distance modulus of Fornax
relative to the Virgo cluster of -0.38+/-0.14mag. The galaxies in the
subcluster are 1.0+/-0.5mag brighter than the galaxies of the main cluster,
indicating that they are situated in the foreground. With their mean velocity

during a merger can lead to large increases in bolometric X-ray luminosities
and emission-weighted temperatures of clusters. Cooling flows are completely
disrupted during equal-mass mergers, with the mass deposition rate dropping to
zero as the cores of the clusters collide. The large increase in the cooling
time of the core gas strongly suggests that cooling flows will not recover from
such a merger within a Hubble time. Mergers with subclumps having 1/8th of the
mass of the main cluster are also found to disrupt a cooling flow if the merger
is head-on. However, in this case the entropy injected into the core gas is
rapidly radiated away and the cooling flow restarts within a few Gyr of the
merger. Mergers in which the subcluster has an impact parameter of 500kpc do
not disrupt the cooling flow, although the mass deposition rate is reduced by
\~30%. Finally, we find that equal mass, off-centre mergers can effectively mix
gas in the cores of clusters, while head on mergers lead to very little mixing.
Gas stripped from the outer layers of subclumps results in parts of the outer
layers of the main cluster being well mixed, although they have little effect
on the gas in the core of the cluster. None of the mergers examined here
resulted in the ICM being well mixed globally.

binary are coeval we can then place also the secondaries into the HRD and
derive masses and mass ratios for both components by comparison with different
sets of current theoretical pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks. The
resulting distribution of mass ratios is comparatively flat for M(2)/M(1) >
0.2, but depends on assumed evolutionary tracks. The mass ratio is neither
correlated with the primary's mass or the components' separation. These
findings are in line with the assumption that for most multiple systems in T

during formation and not by the following accretion processes. Only very few
unusually red objects were newly found among the detected companions. This
finding shows that the observed overabundance of binaries in the Taurus-Auriga

high luminosity. The near-infrared colours of the semi-regular variables
increase in a general way with period and are reddest for the stars with
significant mass-loss. The average colours of Mira variables, whose periods
start at around 200 days in the Bulge, are bluer than those of the

emissivity of a gas in statistical equilibrium. Numerical experiments with
one-point statistical equilibrium problems for Fe II and Hydrogen confirm this
asymptotic behaviour. In addition, the resulting Monte Carlo emissivities are
shown to be far less sensitive to errors in the populations of the emitting
levels than are the values obtained with the basic emissivity formula.

Two geometries have been considered: rings and squares. Mesoscopic correction
to screening are taken into account in a self consistent way, using the
response function formalism. The role of the statistical ensemble (canonical
and grand canonical), disorder and frequency have been investigated. We have
also computed first order corrections to the polarisability due to
electron-electron interactions. Our main results concern the diffusive regime.
In the canonical ensemble, there is no flux dependence polarisability when the
frequency is smaller than the level spacing. On the other hand, in the grand
canonical ensemble for frequencies larger than the mean broadening of the
energy levels (but still small compared to the level spacing), the
polarisability oscillates with flux, with the periodicity $h/2e$. The order of
magnitude of the effect is given by $\delta \alpha/\alpha \propto
(\lambda_s/Wg)$, where $\lambda$ is the Thomas Fermi screening length, $W$ the
width of the rings or the size of the squares and $g$ their average
dimensionless conductance. This magnetopolarisability of Aharonov-Bohm rings
has been recently measured experimentally \cite{PRL_deblock00} and is in good
agreement with our grand canonical result.

One of these strings is referred to as a parameter. The problem: given a
propositional logic program P and a non-negative integer k, decide whether P
has a stable model of size no more than k, is an example of a parameterized
decision problem with k serving as a parameter. Parameterized problems that are
NP-complete often become solvable in polynomial time if the parameter is fixed.
The problem to decide whether a program P has a stable model of size no more
than k, where k is fixed and not a part of input, can be solved in time
O(mn^k), where m is the size of P and n is the number of atoms in P. Thus, this
problem is in the class P. However, algorithms with the running time given by a
polynomial of order k are not satisfactory even for relatively small values of
k.
  The key question then is whether significantly better algorithms (with the
degree of the polynomial not dependent on k) exist. To tackle it, we use the
framework of fixed-parameter complexity. We establish the fixed-parameter
complexity for several parameterized decision problems involving models,
supported models and stable models of logic programs. We also establish the
fixed-parameter complexity for variants of these problems resulting from
restricting attention to Horn programs and to purely negative programs. Most of
the problems considered in the paper have high fixed-parameter complexity.
Thus, it is unlikely that fixing bounds on models (supported models, stable
models) will lead to fast algorithms to decide the existence of such models.

limit, with a Higgs boson similar to the standard one and other, higher-mass

measurements from an LC could help verify several well-motivated extensions of
the standard model. For supersymmetry, we compare the strengths of an LC with
the LHC. Also, assuming the lightest superpartner explains the missing dark
matter in the universe, we examine other places to search for a signal of
supersymmetry. We compare the signatures of several scenarios with extra
spatial dimensions. We also explore the possibility that the Higgs is a
composite, concentrating on models that (unlike technicolor) have a Higgs boson
with mass of a few hundred GeV or less. Where appropriate, we mention the
importance of high luminosity, for example to measure branching ratios of the
Higgs, and the importance of multi-TeV energies, for example to explore the

violating interactions is studied in the presence of the gauge mediated
supersymmetry breaking. Neutrino masses arise in this model at tree level
through the RG-induced vacuum expectation values of the sneutrinos and also
through direct contribution at 1-loop. The relative importance of these
contributions is determined by the values of the strong and weak coupling
constants. In case of purely $\lambda'$ couplings, the tree contribution
dominates over the 1-loop diagram. In this case, one simultaneously obtains
atmospheric neutrino oscillations and quasi-vacuum oscillations of the solar
neutrinos if all the $\l'$ couplings are assumed to be of similar magnitudes.
If R parity violation arises from the trilinear $\l$ couplings, then the loop
induced contribution dominates over the tree level. One cannot simultaneously
explain the solar and atmospheric deficit in this case if all the $\l$
couplings are of similar magnitude. This however becomes possible with
hierarchical $\l$ and we give a specific example of this.

frame of geometry of simple or pure spinors, which imposes contraint equations
on spinors with more than four components, and the momentum spaces result
compact, isomorphic toinvariant-mass-spheres imbedded in each other, since the

strictly correlated with this spinor geometry, from which they appear to
gradually emerge in the construction, where they play a basic role for the

  International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos (9/01)",,"10.1142/S0218127401003449",,"nlin.CD",,"  Quantum billiards provide an excellent forum for the analysis of quantum
chaos. Toward this end, we consider quantum billiards with time-varying
surfaces, which provide an important example of quantum chaos that does not
require the semiclassical ($\hbar \longrightarrow 0$) or high quantum-number
limits. We analyze vibrating quantum billiards using the framework of
Riemannian geometry. First, we derive a theorem detailing necessary conditions
for the existence of chaos in vibrating quantum billiards on Riemannian
manifolds. Numerical observations suggest that these conditions are also
sufficient. We prove the aforementioned theorem in full generality for one
degree-of-freedom boundary vibrations and briefly discuss a generalization to
billiards with two or more degrees-of-vibrations. The requisite conditions are
direct consequences of the separability of the Helmholtz equation in a given
orthogonal coordinate frame, and they arise from orthogonality relations
satisfied by solutions of the Helmholtz equation. We then state and prove a
second theorem that provides a general form for the coupled ordinary
differential equations that describe quantum billiards with one
degree-of-vibration boundaries. This set of equations may be used to illustrate
KAM theory and also provides a simple example of semiquantum chaos. Moreover,
vibrating quantum billiards may be used as models for quantum-well
nanostructures, so this study has both theoretical and practical applications.

slightly with increasing target mass. The $\bar{p}$ yield in 17.5 GeV/c p+Au
collisions decreases with grey track multiplicity, $N_g$, for $N_g>0$,
consistent with annihilation within the target nucleus. The relationship
between $N_g$ and the number of scatterings of the proton in the nucleus is
used to estimate the $\bar{p}$ annihilation cross section in the nuclear
medium. The resulting cross section is at least a factor of five smaller than
the free $\bar{p}-p$ annihilation cross section when assuming a small or
negligible formation time. Only with a long formation time can the data be
described with the free $\bar{p}-p$ annihilation cross section.

treat various interactions in a unified manner, including finite-range ones.
The present method is numerically applied to the spherically-symmetric

bases of the pyroelectric crystals of LiNbO3 and LiTaO3 during changes in

attached to the base under study was used. A reference for the electrometer was
established by grounding the electrometer probe at a specific crystal
temperature, i.e., zeroing the electrometer. When the ground is broken an
induced charge, held captive by the polarization charge at the base of the
crystal, remains in the probe circuit. Then as the temperature of the crystal
is changed the electrometer reads the change in the polarization charge with
respect to the polarization charge at the zeroing temperature. Data was
obtained for each type of crystal and at the -z and +z bases for three
different grounding conditions. Each experiment consisted of data accumulation
for five thermal cycles. The electrometer readings at a given temperature
appeared to be different for the three grounding conditions but the difference
in the charge readings for a given difference of temperature was independent of
the grounding situation. Measurements of the polarization charge were taken
while the temperature of the crystal was held constant for about fourteen
hours. The polarization charge remained constant at the -z and +z base as long
as the temperature remained constant. These results, the independence of the
charge difference for a given temperature difference with respect to the
zeroing conditions and the constancy of the charge reading with respect to the
constancy of the crystal temperature, lead to the inference that the
polarization charge is a reproducible function of the crystal temperature and
is a physical property of the crystal.

can be constructed using polarizing beam splitters that completely transmit one
state of polarization and totally reflect the orthogonal state of polarization,
which allows a simple explanation of each operation. We also describe a
polarizing beam splitter implementation of a CNOT gate that is closely
analogous to the quantum teleportation technique previously suggested by
Gottesman and Chuang [Nature 402, p.390 (1999)]. Finally, our approach has the
