Observations were obtained at two epochs in March 1999 and June 1999 separated
by about 100 days. The goal of our program was to detect any relative changes
among the components and between the two epochs. Over this time baseline we
detected an approximately 0.07 mag dimming in component D of the lensed image,
which we interpret as evidence for microlensing. In March 1999 we find
significant evidence for a difference in the relative linear polarization of
component D in comparison to the other three components; in June 1999 the
combined polarization of the Cloverleaf components was lower. In March 1999 the
apparently microlensed component D has a rotated polarization position angle
and a somewhat higher degree of polarization than the other three components.
We suggest that this difference in polarization is due to microlensing
magnification of part of a scattered-light (i.e. polarized) continuum-producing
region. The results indicate that in the Cloverleaf the size-scale of the
polarized scattered-light region exceeds about 10^{16} cm but lies interior to

resolved with the discovery of the M-sigma relation, which simultaneously
established a tight corrrelation between black hole mass and bulge velocity
dispersion, and confirmed that the stellar kinematical mass estimates were
systematically too large due to failure to resolve the black hole's sphere of

estimating the mean black hole mass, including dynamical mass estimation in

generic feature of galaxies of a wide range of luminosity and morphological
type, (2) the extent of tenuous gas (N(H I) > 10^{14} cm^{-2} around galaxies
scales with galaxy B-band luminosity as r\propto L_B^{0.39+/-0.09}, and (3)
galaxy interactions do not play an important role in distributing tenuous gas
around galaxies in most cases. We further demonstrate that (4) the gaseous
extent of galaxies scales with galaxy K-band luminosity as r\propto
L_K^{0.28+/-0.08}, and (5) tenuous gas around typical L_* galaxies is likely to
be distributed in spherical halos of radius ~ 180 h^{-1} kpc of covering factor
of nearly unity. Because galaxies of all morphological types possess extended
gaseous halos and because the extent of tenuous gas around galaxies scales with
galaxy K-band luminosity, we argue that galaxy mass---rather than recent
star-formation activity---is likely to be the dominant factor that determines
the extent of tenuous gas around galaxies. Nevertheless, applying the scaling
relationship between the extent of Lya absorbing gas around galaxies and galaxy
B-band luminosity, the results of our analysis also suggest that the number
density evolution of Lya absorption systems may serve to constrain the
evolution of the comoving galaxy B-band luminosity density (at least for the

results of our study show that 41% of the CME related transients observed are

associated with eruptions of prominences embedded in active regions and 15% are
associated with eruptions of prominences outside active regions. Those CMEs
that do not involve prominence eruptions originate in active regions both with
and without prominences. We describe 6 especially well observed events. These
case studies suggest that active region CMEs (without eruptive prominences) are
associated with active regions with lifetimes between 11--80 days. They are
also often associated with small scale emerging or cancelling flux over
timescales of 6--7 hours. CMEs associated with active region prominence
eruptions, on the other hand, are typically associated with old active regions

Non-trivial quantum mechanical corrections to the classical ground state lead
to multiparticle exchange processes that can be expressed as an effective spin
Hamiltonian involving competing interactions. Disorder will destroy the Wigner
crystal on large length scales, and the resulting state is called a Wigner
glass. The notion of multiparticle exchange processes is still applicable in
the Wigner glass, but the exchange frequencies now follow a random

distributions for some important processes in the Wigner glass. The resulting

upper bounds are almost tight and improve exponentially over the previous
bounds when D and Delta are polylogarithmic in n. Network topologies having

bi-orthogonality relationships are used in a standard canonical quantization
procedure based on introducing generalised coordinates and momenta for the

quantum harmonic oscillators (QHO), associated with either the cavity or the
external region NHM. This confirms the validity of the photon model in unstable
optical systems, though the annihilation and creation operators for each QHO
are not Hermitean adjoints. The quantum Hamiltonian for the EM field is the sum
of non-commuting cavity and external region contributions, each of which is sum
of independent QHO Hamiltonians for each NHM, but the external field
Hamiltonian also includes a coupling term responsible for external NHM photon
exchange processes. Cavity energy gain and loss processes is associated with
the non-commutativity of cavity and external region operators, given in terms
of surface integrals involving cavity and external region NHM functions on the
cavity-external region boundary. The spontaneous decay of a two-level atom
inside an unstable cavity is treated using the essential states approach and

photon absorption have a different coupling constant to those leading to photon

completely different from so-called hidden parameter models, namely, we start
from a certain variant of QM - deterministic QM - which has most features
similar to QM, but the evolution in this theory is deterministic. Then we
introduce the subquantum medium composed of so-called space-like objects. The
interaction of a deterministic QM-particle with this medium is represented by
the random force, but it is the random force governed by the probability
amplitude distribution. This is the quantum random force and it is very
different from classical random force. This implies that in our models there
are no Bell`s inequalities and that our models (depending on a certain
parameter tau) can be arbitrarily close to QM. The parameter tau defines a
relaxation time and on time intervals shorter than tau, the evolution violates
Heisenberg`s uncertainty principle and it is almost deterministic - spreading
of the wave packet is much slower than in QM. Such type of short-time effects
form the bases of proposed tests, which can, in principle, define limits of
validity of QM. The proposed experiments are related to the behavior of quantum
objects on short time intervals, where we expect the behavior different from

probability of correctly estimating Alice's commitment and Alice's probability
of successfully unveiling whatever bit she desires. In this paper, we seek to
determine these bounds for generalizations of the BB84 bit commitment protocol.
In such protocols, an honest Alice commits to a bit by randomly choosing a
state from a specified set and submitting this to Bob, and later unveils the
bit to Bob by announcing the chosen state, at which point Bob measures the
projector onto the state. Bob's optimal cheating strategy can be easily deduced
from well known results in the theory of quantum state estimation. We show how
to understand Alice's most general cheating strategy, (which involves her
submitting to Bob one half of an entangled state) in terms of a theorem of
Hughston, Jozsa and Wootters. We also show how the problem of optimizing
Alice's cheating strategy for a fixed submitted state can be mapped onto a
problem of state estimation. Finally, using the Bloch ball representation of
qubit states, we identify the optimal coherent attack for a class of protocols
that can be implemented with just a single qubit. These results provide a tight
upper bound on Alice's probability of successfully unveiling whatever bit she
desires in the protocol proposed by Aharonov et al., and lead us to identify a
qubit protocol with even greater security.
