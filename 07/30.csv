buoyant bubble of plasma deposited by an intermittently active jet. The extent
of the rise of the bubble and its morphology imply that the ratio of its
density to that of the surrounding ISM is less than 10^{-2}, consistent with
our knowledge of extragalactic jets and minimal entrainment into the precursor
radio lobe. Using the morphology of the lobe to date the beginning of its rise
through the atmosphere of Centaurus A, we conclude that the bubble has been
rising for approximately 140Myr. This time scale is consistent with that
proposed by Quillen et al. (1993) for the settling of post-merger gas into the
presently observed large scale disk in NGC 5128, suggesting a strong connection
between the delayed re-establishment of radio emission and the merger of NGC
5128 with a small gas-rich galaxy. This suggests a connection, for radio
galaxies in general, between mergers and the delayed onset of radio emission.
In our model, the elongated X-ray emission region discovered by Feigelson et
al. (1981), part of which coincides with the northern middle lobe, is thermal
gas that originates from the ISM below the bubble and that has been uplifted
and compressed. The ""large-scale jet"" appearing in the radio images of Morganti
et al. (1999) may be the result of the same pressure gradients that cause the
uplift of the thermal gas, acting on much lighter plasma, or may represent a
jet that did not turn off completely when the northern middle lobe started to
buoyantly rise. We propose that the adjacent emission line knots (the ""outer
filaments"") and star-forming regions result from the disturbance, in particular
the thermal trunk, caused by the bubble moving through the extended atmosphere
of NGC 5128.

galaxy Mrk~273 Using the ACIS-S3 instrument on board Chandra. The high
resolution X-ray image, for the first time, reveals a compact hard X-ray
nucleus in Mrk~273. Its X-ray energy distribution is well described by a
heavily obscured power-law spectrum plus a narrow $\Feka$ emission line at 6.4
keV. The neutral hydrogen column density is about $4\times10^{23}\cm^{-2}$,
implying an absorption -corrected X-ray luminosity (0.1--10 keV) for the
nucleus of $\Lx\approx 6.5\times 10^{43} \ergs$. There are also bright soft
X-ray clumps and diffuse soft X-ray emissions surrounding the central hard
X-ray nucleus within the $10\arcsec$ of the nuclear region. Its spectrum can be
fitted by a MEKAL thermal model with temperature of about 0.8 keV and high
metallicity ($Z\sim 1.5Z_\odot$) plus emission lines from $\alpha$ elements and
ions. Further outside the central region, the Chandra observations reveal a
very extended hot gas halo with a projected diameter of about $108 \kpc\times
68 \kpc$ and soft X-ray luminosity of $\Lx\approx 1.9\times 10^{41} \ergs$. The

recent results of a similar fit to the black-hole candidates (BHCs) GX 339-4
and Cyg X-1 by Nowak in 2000. We find that one to six Lorentzians are needed to
fit the power spectra of our two sources. The use of exactly the same fit
function reveals that the timing behaviour of 4U 0614+09 and 4U 1728-34 is
almost identical at luminosities which are about a factor 5 different. As the
characteristic frequency of the Lorentzians we use the frequency, nu_max, at
which each component contributes most of its variance per log frequency as
proposed by Belloni, Psaltis & van der Klis in 2001. When using nu_max instead
of the centroid frequency of the Lorentzian, the recently discovered hectohertz
Lorentzian is practically constant in frequency. We use our results to test the
suggestions by, respectively, Psaltis Belloni and van der Klis in 1999 and
Nowak in 2000 that the two Lorentzians describing the high-frequency end of the
broad-band noise in BHCs in the low state can be identified with the kilohertz
QPOs in the neutron star low mass X-ray binaries. We find, that when the two
kilohertz QPOs are clearly present, the low-frequency part of the power
spectrum is too complicated to draw immediate conclusions from the nature of
the components detected in any one power spectrum. However, the relations we
observe between the characteristic frequencies of the kilohertz QPOs and the
band-limited noise, when compared to the corresponding relations in BHCs, hint
towards the identification of the second-highest frequency Lorentzian in the
BHCs with the lower kilohertz QPO. They do not confirm the identification of
the highest-frequency Lorentzian with the upper kilohertz QPO.

spectrophotometric evolution of stellar systems: Chemical yields from stars
correspond to a precise fraction of their emitted light. We translate this
concept quantitatively. Starting from simple stellar populations, we derive
useful analytical relations to calculate the stellar fuel consumption (emitted
light) as a function of basic quantities predicted by stellar models, i.e. the
mass of the core and the chemical composition of the envelope. The final
formulas explicate the relation between integrated light contribution (total or
limited to particular evolutionary phases), chemical yields and stellar
remnants. We test their accuracy in the case of low- and intermediate-mass
stars, and indicate the way to extend the analysis to massive stars. This
formalism provides an easy tool to check the internal consistency between the
different stellar inputs adopted in galaxy models: The fuel computed by means
of the analytical formulas (corresponding to a given set of chemical yields)
should be compared to the exact values given by the luminosity integration
along the stellar evolutionary tracks or isochrones (corresponding to a given
set of spectrophotometric models). Only if both estimates of the fuel are
similar, the stellar inputs can be considered self-consistent in terms of their
energetics. This sets an important requirement to galaxy models, also in
consideration of the fact that different sources of input stellar data are
frequently used to model their spectro-photometric and chemical evolution.

Babcock-Leighton idea that the poloidal field is generated at the surface of

handled with a realistic recipe - wherein toroidal flux is made to erupt from
the overshoot layer wherever it exceeds a specified critical field ($10^5$ G).
The erupted toroidal field is then acted upon by the alpha effect near the
surface to give rise to the poloidal field. In the first half of this paper we
present a parameter space study of this model, to bring out similarities and
differences between it and other well studied models of the past. In the second
half of this paper we show that the mechanism of buoyant eruptions and the
subsequent depletion of the toroidal field inside the overshoot layer, is
capable of constraining the magnitude of the dynamo generated magnetic field
there, although a global quenching mechanism is still required to ensure that
the magnetic fields do not blow up. We also believe that a critical study of
this mechanism may give us new information regarding the solar interior and end
with an example, where we propose a new method for estimating an upper limit of

populations, where input units activate output ones via gaussian weights and a
threshold linear transfer function. We evaluate the information carried by a
population of M output units, again about continuous+discrete correlates. The
mutual information is evaluated solving saddle point equations under the
assumption of replica symmetry, a method which, by taking into account only the
term linear in N of the input information, is equivalent to assuming the noise
to be large. Within this limitation, we analyze the dependence of the
information on the ratio M/N, on the selectivity of the input units and on the
level of the output noise. We show analytically, and confirm numerically, that
in the limit of a linear transfer function and of a small ratio between output

has been motivated by the exact solution of simple models. This approach allows
one to set on firmer grounds well-known phenomenological theories. The old
ideas of entropy crisis, fictive temperatures, free-volume... have clear
definitions within these models. Aging effects in the glass phase are also
captured. One of the salient features of the analytic solution, the breakdown
of the fluctuation-dissipation relations, provides a definition of a bonafide
{\it effective temperature} that is measurable by a thermometer, controls heat
flows, partial equilibrations, and the reaction to the external injection of
heat. The effective temperature is an extremely robust concept that appears in
non-equilibrium systems in the limit of small entropy production as, for
instance, sheared fluids, glasses at low temperatures when quantum fluctuations
are relevant, tapped or vibrated granular matter, etc. The emerging scenario is
one of partial equilibrations, in which glassy systems arrange their internal
degrees of freedom so that the slow ones select their own effective
temperatures. It has been proven to be consistent within any perturbative
resummation scheme (mode coupling, etc) and it can be challenged by
experimental and numerical tests, some of which it has already passed.

hand renormalons do not occur in conformal theories, such as the one describing
the infrared fixed-point of QCD at small beta_0 (the Banks--Zaks limit). Since
the fixed-point has a perturbative realization, all-order perturbative
relations exist between the conformal coefficients, which are renormalon-free,
and the standard perturbative coefficients, which contain renormalons.
Therefore, an explicit cancellation of renormalons should occur in these
relations. The absence of renormalons in the conformal limit can thus be seen
as a constraint on the structure of the QCD perturbative expansion. We show
that the conformal constraint is non-trivial: a generic model for the
large-order behaviour violates it. We also analyse a specific example, based on
a renormalon-type integral over the two-loop running-coupling, where the

the capacity ratio of defects is enough large, the temperature gradient can be
formed and the finite heat conduction is found in the model. The defects in the
2D harmonic lattices impede the energy carriers free propagation, by another
words, the mean free paths of the energy carrier are relatively short. The
microscopic dynamics leads to the finite conduction in the model.

Research) there are often disparate databases (different in format, type and
structure) that users need to access in a domain-specific manner. Users may
want to access a simple unit of information without having to understand detail
of the underlying schema or they may want to access the same information from
several different sources. It is neither desirable nor feasible to require
users to have knowledge of these schemas. Instead it would be advantageous if a
user could query these sources using his or her own domain models and
abstractions of the data. This paper describes the basis of an XML (eXtended
Markup Language) framework that provides this functionality and is currently
being developed at CERN. The goal of the first prototype was to explore the
possibilities of XML for data integration and model management. It shows how
XML can be used to integrate data sources. The framework is not only applicable
to CERN data sources but other environments too.

given. Applications to bulk material, multi-slab planar structures, and
microspheres are studied. It is shown that when the two molecules are near a
planar interface, then surface-guided waves can strongly affect the energy
transfer and essentially modify both the (F\""{o}rster) short-range $R^{-6}$
dependence of the transfer rate and the long-range $R^{-2}$ dependence, which
are typically observed in free space. In particular, enhancement (inhibition)
of energy transfer can be accompanied by inhibition (enhancement) of donor
decay. Results for four- and five-layered planar structures are given and
compared with experimental results. Finally, the energy transfer between two
molecules located at diametrically opposite positions outside a microsphere is
briefly discussed.
