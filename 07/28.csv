investigate the dependence of \omega(\theta) at 1', A_\omega(1'), on sample

A_\omega(1') decreases monotonically to IAB~25. At bright magnitudes,
\omega(\theta) is consistent with a power-law of slope \delta = -0.8 for

Furthermore, in the magnitude ranges 18.5<IAB<24.0 and 18.5<IAB<23.0 we find
galaxies with 2.6<(V-I)AB<2.9 have A_\omega(1')'s which are ~10x higher than
field values. We demonstrate that our model redshift distributions for the
faint galaxy population are in good agreement with current spectroscopic
observations. Using these predictions, we find that for low-omega cosmologies
and assuming r_0=4.3/h Mpc, in the range 19.5<I(AB-med)<22, the growth of
galaxy clustering is \epsilon~0. However, at 22<I(AB-med)<24.0, our
observations are consistent with \epsilon>1. Models with \epsilon~0 cannot
simultaneously match both bright and faint measurements of A_\omega(1`). We
show how this result is a natural consequence of the ``bias-free'' nature of
the \epsilon formalism and is consistent with the field galaxy population in
the range 22.0<IAB<24.0 being dominated by galaxies of low intrinsic

We find that the optical-near-IR colours and luminosities of the brightest ~10
clusters in NGC 1316 are consistent with those of intermediate-age (2-3 Gyr)
populations. Unlike `normal' giant ellipticals, the B-I colour distribution of
clusters in NGC 1316 is not clearly bimodal. However, the luminosity functions
(LFs) of the blue and red parts of the cluster colour distribution are
different: The red cluster LF is well represented by a power law with index
-1.2 +/- 0.3, extending to about 1.5 mag brighter (in B) than those of typical
giant ellipticals. In contrast, the shape of the blue cluster LF is consistent
with that of `normal' spiral and elliptical galaxies. We conclude that the star
cluster system of NGC 1316 is a combination of a population of age ~3 Gyr
having roughly solar metallicity and a population of old, metal-poor clusters
which probably belonged to the pre-merger galaxies. After the 3 Gyr old,
metal-rich clusters fade to an age of 10 Gyr, they will form a red `peak' in a
bimodal cluster colour distribution. This `red peak' will have a colour
consistent with that found in `normal, old' giant ellipticals of the same
galaxy luminosity (taking age dimming into account). These features of the star
cluster system of NGC 1316 are fully consistent with scenarios for forming
`normal' giant elliptical galaxies through gas-rich mergers at look-back times
$\ga$ 10 Gyr.

function might be very different in different locations. The luminosity
function might be rising in rich clusters and flat or declining in regions of
low density. If galaxies form according to the model of hierarchical clustering
then there should be many small halos compared to the number of big halos. If
this theory is valid then there must be a mechanism that eliminates at least
the visible component of galaxies in low density regions. A plausible mechanism
is photoionization of the intergalactic medium at a time before the epoch that
most dwarf galaxies form in low density regions but after the epoch of
formation for similar systems that ultimately end up in rich clusters. The
dynamical timescales are found to accommodate this hypothesis in a flat
universe with Omega_m < 0.4.
  If small halos exist but simply cannot be located because they have never
become the sites of significant star formation, they still might have dynamical
manifestations. These manifestations are hard to identify in normal groups of
galaxies because small halos do not make a significant contribution to the
global mass budget. However, it could be entertained that there are clusters of
halos where there are only small systems, clusters that are at the low mass end
of the hierarchical tree. There may be places where only a few small galaxies
managed to form, enough for us to identify and use as test probes of the
potential. It turns out that such environments might be common. Four probable
groups of dwarfs are identified within 5 Mpc and the assumption they are
gravitationally bound suggests M/L_B ~ 300 - 1200 M_sun/L_sun, 6 +/- factor 2

interacting/merging system. Under the assumption that the X-ray afterglow is
mainly due to synchrotron mechanism we infer the optical afterglow flux. The
observed upper limits to the optical flux are easily explained by invoking an
intervening dusty cloud within the host galaxy. These observations support the
idea that GRBs with no detectable optical afterglows or ""dark GRBs"" can be due
to dust extinction within the host galaxies. The census of dark GRBs can then
be used to constrain the fraction of the obscured star formation in the

first attempt to model both the thermal and nonthermal X-ray emission over the
entire X-ray energy band from 0.12 to 17 keV. The thermal flux is described by
a nonequilibrium ionization model with an electron temperature kT = 0.6 keV, an
ionization timescale n0t = 9 x 10^9 s / cm^3, and a relative elemental
abundance of silicon that is 10-18 times larger than the solar abundance. The
nonthermal X-ray spectrum is described by a broken power law model with low-

Since the nonthermal X-ray spectrum steepens with increasing energy, the
results of the present analysis corroborate previous claims that the nonthermal

field strength is significantly larger than previous estimates of about 1 x

not accelerate nuclei to energies as high as the energy of the ""knee,""

we will be able to constrain beta to within ~0.1 at z=1. For the DEEP2 survey
we will combine the correlation statistics with galaxy observables such as
spectral type, morphology, absolute luminosity, and linewidth to measure the
relative biases in different galaxy types. Here we use a counts-in-cells

dipole-like temperature distribution across the the cluster, and provides a
promising way to measure the angular momentum distribution of gas inside
clusters. Information obtained from such a measurement may provide new insights
to the origin and evolution of angular momentum in hierarchical structure
formation theory. For typical, well relaxed, clusters of mass a few times
10$^{14}$ M$_{\sun}$, the peak fluctuation is of the order a few $\mu$K,
depending on the rotational velocity and the inclination angle of the
rotational axis. For clusters which had underwent a recent merger, the
contribution to temperature fluctuations could be even larger. This dipole
signature is similar to the one produced by lensed CMB towards galaxy clusters,
though the lensing contribution spans a larger angular extent than the one due
to rotational scattering as the former depends on the gradient of the cluster
potential. Since the lensing contribution towards clusters are aligned with the
large scale CMB gradient, when higher resolution observations towards clusters
are combined with a wide field CMB map, these two effects can be separated. An
additional, but less important, source of confusion is the dipolar pattern
produced by the moving-lens effect involving, again, the gradient of the
cluster potential and the transverse velocity. The angular power spectrum of
temperature anisotropies produced by the halo rotation is expected to be
smaller than those due to the thermal SZ and peculiar velocity kinetic SZ

image deeply enough quickly enough: We fit a variety of brightness distribution

increasing function of grain size for small grains. We investigate how these
very different, but somewhat complementary, processes change the optical depth
of the circumburst medium. To this end, we adopt a canonical distribution of

compute the post-burst/optical flash/afterglow optical depth of a circumburst

do significantly extinguish (tau > 3) the optical afterglow if R >
10L_{49}^{1/2} pc and N_H > 5x10^{21} cm^{-2}, creating a so-called `dark
burst'. The majority of bursts are dark, and as circumburst extinction is
probably the primary cause of this, this implies that most dark bursts occur in
clouds of this size and mass M > 3x10^5L_{49} M_{sun}. Clouds of this size and
mass are typical of giant molecular clouds, and are active regions of star
formation.

case dark bursts are probably a byproduct of this burst of star formation if
the molecular cloud formed recently, and/or the result of lingering or latter
generation star formation if the molecular cloud formed some time ago. We then
show that if bursts occur in Galactic-like molecular clouds, the column

comparable to the number of bursts with detected optical afterglows: This is
what is observed, which suggests that the bursts with detected optical

population in Abell 868, a rich, intermediate redshift (z=0.154) cluster which
has a galaxy luminosity function with a steep faint-end slope (alpha=-1.26 +/-
0.05). A statistical background subtraction method is employed to study the B-R
colour distribution of the cluster galaxies. This distribution suggests that
the galaxies contributing to the faint-end of the measured cluster LF can be
split into three populations: dIrrs with B-R<1.4; dEs with 1.4<B-R<2.5; and
contaminating background giant ellipticals (gEs) with B-R>2.5. The remvoal of
the contribution of the background gEs from the counts only marginally lessens
the faint-end slope (alpha=-1.22 +/- 0.16). However, the removal of the
contribution of the dIrrs from the counts produces a flat LF (alpha=-0.91 +/-
0.16). The dEs and the dIrrs have similar spatial distributions within the
cluster except that the dIrrs appear to be totally absent within a central
projected radius of about 0.2 Mpc (Ho=75 km/s /Mpc). The number density of both
dEs and dIrrs appear to fall off beyond a projected radius of about 0.35 Mpc.
We suggest that the dE and dIrr populations of A868 have been associated with
the cluster for similar timescales but that evolutionary processes such as
`galaxy harassment' tend to fade the dIrr galaxies while having much less
effect on the dE galaxies. The harassement would be expected to have the
greatest effect on dwarfs residing in the central parts of the cluster.

the number of known BPNe and proto-BPNe. Accordingly we argue that every BPN is
a `unique' object in its appearance, but all can be explained within the binary

we identify the low-energy states of this model with the local extrema of the
defining two-dimensional Gaussian random surface. Furthermore, combining this
``surface fluctuation'' mechanism with a renormalization group treatment of a
related vortex glass problem leads us to argue that the asymptotic low $E$
behavior of the density of states in the {\it general} case is $\rho(E) \sim
E^{-1} e^{-|\ln E|^{2/3}}$, different from earlier prediction of Gade. We also
study the localized phases of such particle-hole symmetric systems and identify

make statements of general validity, without specifying at least some features

spacecraft heat. Various forms of non-isotropic radiation were proposed by
Katz, Murphy, and Scheffer, but Anderson, et al. felt that none of these could
explain the observed effect. This paper calculates the known effects in more
detail and considers new sources of radiation, all based on spacecraft
construction. These effects are then modelled over the duration of the
experiment. The model reproduces the acceleration from its appearance at a
heliocentric distance of 5 AU to the last measurement at 71 AU to within 10
percent. However, it predicts a larger decrease in acceleration between
intervals I and III of the Pioneer 10 observations than is observed. This is a
2 sigma discrepancy from the average of the three analyses (SIGMA, CHASMP, and
Markwardt). A more complex (but more speculative) model provides a somewhat
better fit. Radiation forces can also plausibly explain the previously
unmodelled torques, including the spindown of Pioneer 10 that is directly
proportional to spacecraft bus heat, and the slow but constant spin-up of
Pioneer 11. In any case, by accounting for the bulk of the acceleration, the
proposed mechanism makes it much more likely that the entire effect can be
explained without the need for new physics.

the precise relationship between logarithmic operators and their primary
partners is not yet sufficiently understood in all cases, the derivation of
operator product expansion formulae is only possible under certain assumptions.
The easiest cases are studied in this paper: firstly, where operator product
expansions of two primaries only contain primary fields, secondly, where the
primary fields are pre-logarithmic operators. Some comments on generalization
towards more relaxed assumptions are made, in particular towards the case where
logarithmic fields are not quasi-primary. We identify an algebraic structure
