single crystal with columnar defects (CD), using a technique based on sample
rotation under a fixed magnetic field H. This method is valid for samples whose
magnetization vector remains perpendicular to the sample surface over a wide
angle range - which is the case for platelets and thin films - and presents
several advantages over measurements of M_L(H) loops at fixed angles. The
resulting M_i(\Theta) curves for several temperatures show a peak in the CD
direction at high fields. At lower fields, a very well defined plateau
indicative of the vortex lock-in to the CD develops. The H dependence of the
lock-in angle \phi_L follows the H^{-1} theoretical prediction, while the
temperature dependence is in agreement with entropic smearing effects
corresponding to short range vortex-defects interactions.

  Nashville, Tennessee",,,,"hep-ph",,"  The depth of our theoretical understanding of neutrino flavor mixing should
match the importance of this phenomenon as a herald of long-awaited empirical
challenges to the standard model of particle physics. After reviewing the
familiar, simplified quantum mechanical model and its flaws, I sketch the
deeper understanding of both vacuum and matter-enhanced flavor mixing that is
found in the framework of scattering theory. While the simplified model gives
the ``correct answer'' for atmospheric, solar, and accelerator/reactor neutrino
phenomena, I argue that a key insight from the deeper picture will simplify the
treatment of neutrino transport in astrophysical environments---supernovae, for
example---in which neutrinos play a dynamically important role.

Hilbert Space H, and let tau denote the normalized trace on B(H). Set b_1 =
(c+c*)/2 and b_2 = (c-c*)/2i, and write B for the the spectral scale of {b_1,
b_2} with respect to tau. We show that B contains full information about
(W_k)(c), the k-numerical range of c for each k =1,...,n. We then use our
previous work on spectral scales to prove several new facts about (W_k)(c). For
example, we show in Theorem 3.4 that the point lambda is a singular point on
the boundary of (W_k)(c) if and only if lambda is an isolated extreme point of
(W_k)(c). In this case lambda = (n/k)tau(cz), where z is a central projection
in in the algebra generated by b_1, b_2 and the identity. We show in Theorem
3.5, that c is normal if and only if (W_k)(c) is a polygon for each k. Finally,
it is shown in Theorem 5.4 that the boundary of (W_k)(c) is the finite union of
line segments and curved real analytic arcs.

representation of homotopy types.
  We show that any locally finite nilpotent homotopy can be represented by a
simplicial set which is a finitely generated free group in all degrees and
whose maps are given by polynomials with rational coefficients. Such a
simplicial set is in some sense a universal localisation/completion as all
localisations and completions of the homotopy is easily contructed from it.
  In particular relations with the Quillen and Sullivan approaches are
presented.
  When the theory is applied to the Eilenberg-MacLane space of a torsion free
finitely generated nilpotent group a close relation to the the theory of Passi
polynomial maps is obtained.

discuss a different subject, ``dark equations"". These have never indicated that
they influence anything or even exist, but if one supposes that they do exist,
one can systematically discover them and study their properties, some of which
turn out to be strange and others mysterious. These equations are similar in
spirit to what one gets when linearizing a given system, or studies how an
external linear wave interacts with a particular solution of a given system. We
define and study linear extensions of dynamical systems in general, and
integrable and Hamiltonian systems in particular. Systems discussed include the
KdV and mKdV equations and the associated Miura maps, the Burgers hierarchy and
the associated Hopf--Cole transformations, long wave equations, the Benney
hierarchy, and the KP hierarchy.
