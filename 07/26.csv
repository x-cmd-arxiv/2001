least four times larger than previously determined. This increase arises from
accounting for the kinematical nature of the absorber and from our conclusion
that the outflow does not cover the narrow emission line region in this object.
The improved column density determination begins to bridge the gap between the
high column densities measured in the X-ray and the low ones previously
inferred from the UV lines. Combined with our findings for outflows in high
luminosity quasars these results suggest that traditional techniques for
measuring column densities: equivalent width, curve-of-growth and Gaussian
modeling, are of limited value when applied to absorption associated with AGN

collimation in the WD accretion column, due to resonance scattering of line

the effect is augmented by the vertical velocity gradient there, which reduces
the resonant trapping of resonant photons along the magnetic field lines. This
effect was quantitatively confirmed with Monte-Carlo simulations. Furthermore,
with ASCA observations of the polar V834 Centauri, this collimation effect was
clearly detected as a rotational modulation of the equivalent width of the Fe-K

at larger scales. Using our Fabry-Perot interferograms, we also present an

find that there is a clear correlation at scales 0.02-0.22 pc between the mean
quadratic differences of radial velocities and distance over the surface of the

related to turbulence. The first and second order moments of the velocity
increments are found to scale as <|Delta v(r)|> ~ r^{0.5} and <|Delta v(r)|^2>
\~ r^{0.9}. The former scaling law strongly suggests that compressible
turbulence is at play in M1-67, on the other hand, the latter scaling law

reactions which can produce large amounts of the light nuclides lithium,
beryllium, and boron (LiBeB). Using analytic velocity spectra of the hypernova
ejecta, we calculate the LiBeB yields of different exploding C-O cores
associated with observed hypernovae. The deduced yields are $\sim 10^3$ times
higher than those produced by similar (direct) means in normal Type II
supernovae, and are higher than the commonly used ones arising from shock wave
acceleration induced by Type II supernova (SN) explosions. To avoid
overproduction of these elements in our Galaxy, hypernovae should be rare
events, with $\la 10^{-3}$ hypernovae per supernova, assuming a constant HN/SN
ratio over time. This rate is in good agreement with that of long duration GRBs
if we assume that the gamma-ray emission is focussed with a beaming factor
$\Omega/4\pi \la 10^{-2}$. This encouraging result supports the possible HN-GRB
association. Thus, Galactic LiBeB abundance measurements offer a promising way
to probe the HN rate history and the possible HN-GRB correlation. On the other
hand, if hypernovae are associated to very massive pregalactic stars
(Population III) they would produce a LiBeB pre-enrichment in proto-galactic

galaxy NGC1291. The X-ray emission from the bulge resembles the X-ray emission
from a sub-class of elliptical and S0 galaxies with low L_X/L_B luminosity
ratios. The X-ray emission is composed of a central point-like nucleus, ~50
point sources that are most likely low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), and diffuse
gas detectable out to a radius of 120"" (5.2 kpc). The diffuse gas has a global
temperature of 0.32^{+0.04}_{-0.03} keV and metallicity of 0.06 +/- 0.02 solar,
and both quantities marginally decrease with increasing radius. The hot gas
fills the hole in the HI distribution, and the softening of the spectrum of the
X-ray gas with radius might indicate a thermal coupling of the hot and cold
phases of the interstellar medium as previously suggested. The integrated X-ray
luminosity of the LMXBs, once normalized by the optical luminosity, is a factor
of 1.4 less than in the elliptical galaxy NGC4697 or S0 galaxy NGC1553. The
difference in L_{X,stellar}/L_B between the galaxies appears to be because of a
lack of very bright sources in NGC1291. No sources above 3 x 10^38 ergs/s were
found in NGC1291 when ~7 were expected from scaling from NGC4697 and NGC1553.
The cumulative L_{X,stellar}/L_B value including only sources below 1.0 x 10^38
ergs/s is remarkably similar between NGC1291 and NGC4697, if a recent surface
brightness fluctuation-determined distance is assumed for NGC4697. If this is a
common feature of the LMXB population in early-type systems, it might be used
as a distance indicator. Finally, a bright, variable (1.6-3.1 x 10^39 ergs/s)
source was detected at the optical center of the galaxy. Its spectrum shows
excess soft emission superimposed on a highly absorbed power law component,

We find that the slopes of the clump mass distributions (-1.28 and -1.49, for
WB89 85 and WB89 380, respectively) are somewhat less steep than found for most
local clouds, but similar to those of clouds which have been analyzed with the
same clumpfind program. We investigate the clump stability by using the virial
theorem, including all possible contributions (gravity, turbulence, magnetic
fields, and pressure due to the interclump gas). It appears that under
reasonable assumptions a combination of these forces would render most clumps
stable. Comparing only gravity and turbulence, we find that in the far-outer
Galaxy clouds, these forces are in equilibium (virial parameter alpha~1) for
clumps down to the lowest masses found (a few Msol). For clumps in the local
clouds alpha~1 only for clumps with masses larger than a few tens of Msol. Thus
it appears that in these outer Galaxy clumps gravity is the dominant force down
to a much lower mass than in local clouds, implying that gravitational collapse
and star formation may occur more readily even in the smallest clumps. Although
there are some caveats, due to the inhomogeneity of the data used, this might
explain the apparently steeper IMF found in the outer Galaxy.

of galaxy types and luminosities at any given HI mass, the galaxies
contributing to the HI cross-section are not exclusively L_star spirals, as is
often expected. The optical and near infrared counterparts of these galaxies
cover a range of types (from spirals to irregulars), luminosities (from L_star
to <0.01 L_star), and surface brightnesses. The range of optical and near

calculations indicate that progenitors initially of 8-10M_sol, undergoing
expected mass loss, can also be excluded because a second dredge up sends them
to somewhat higher luminosities than a star of initially 12M_sol. These results
limit the progenitor's initial main-sequence mass to a very narrow range of 12
+/- 1 M_sol. We discuss the similarities between the Type II-P SNe 1999em and
1999gi and their progenitor mass limits, and suggest that SN Type II-P
originate only in intermediate mass stars of 8-12M_sol, which are in the red
supergiant region and that higher mass stars produce the other Type II
sub-types. (Abridged).

median V-I color in the HDF-North and South shows a significant difference
around I_AB~26, possibly due to the presence of large scale structure at z~1 in
the HDF-N. High-z galaxy candidates (90 U dropout and 17 B dropout) were

more dwarf-sized objects than the observed number of dwarf galaxies --- the
so-called sub-structure problem. We investigate whether the suppression of star
formation in these small objects due to the presence of a photoionizing
background can resolve the problem. We make use of results from recent
hydrodynamic simulations to build a recipe for the suppression of gas infall
into semi-analytic galaxy formation models, and use these to predict the
luminosity function of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. In the models without
photoionization ``squelching'', we predict a large excess of faint dwarf
galaxies compared with the observed number in the Local Group --- thus, the
usual recipe for supernovae feedback used in semi-analytic models does not
solve the sub-structure problem on its own. When we include photoionization
squelching, we find good agreement with the observations. We have neglected
tidal destruction, which probably further reduces the number of dwarf galaxies.
We conclude that photoionizing squelching easily solves the sub-structure
problem. In fact, it is likely that once this effect is taken into account,
models with reduced small-scale power (e.g. Warm Dark Matter) would
underproduce dwarf galaxies.

interpenetrated by a redox electrolyte. The high surface area of the TiO$_2$
and the spectral characteristics of the dye allow the device to harvest 46% of
the solar energy flux. One of the puzzling features of dye-sensitised

considerations suggest that the driving force for electron collection at the

characterised by small amplitude pulse or intensity modulated illumination.

lengths, i.e. $c^2(\mathrm{d}t)^2 = g_{\alpha \beta} \mathrm{d} x^\alpha
\mathrm{d} x^\beta$, with $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum, $t$ time,
$g_{\alpha \beta}$ and the metric tensor; $x^\alpha$ represents any of 4 space
coordinates. The last 3 coordinates $(\alpha = 1,2,3)$ are immediately
associated with the usual physical space coordinates, while the first
coordinate $(\alpha=0)$ is later found to be related to \emph{proper time}. The
work shows that this principle is applicable in several important situations
and suggests that the underlying principle can, in fact, be used universally.
Starting with special relativity it is shown that there is perfect mapping
between the geodesics on Minkowski space-time and on this alternative space.
The discussion than follows through light propagation in a refractive medium,
and some cases of gravitation, including Schwartzschild's outer metric. The
last part of the presentation is dedicated to electromagnetic interaction and
Maxwell's equations, showing that there is a particular solution where one of
the space dimensions is eliminated and the geodesics become equivalent to light
rays in geometrical optics. A very brief discussion is made of the implications

about 0.4 eV/$c^2$. This explanation is supported by experimental data from
extensive air-shower experiments, and in particular by the observation (Fly's
Eye) of a second kink around 300 PeV, and by the abrupt change in the chemical
composition of the cosmic ray spectrum that occurs at that energy. Both facts
follow naturally from our theory, which predicts additional verifiable features

projective fundamental group. We use actions on the set of wiring diagrams,
introduced in [GTV] (math.AG/0107178), to classify real arrangements of up to 8
lines. In particular, we show that the incidence lattice of such arrangements
determines both the affine and the projective fundamental groups.

direct numerical simulations. Lagrangian statistics is found to be compatible
with Richardson description although small systematic deviations are found. The
value of the Richardson constant is estimated as $C_2 \simeq 0.55$, in a close
agreement with recent experimental findings [S. Ott and J. Mann J. Fluid Mech.
{\bf 422}, 207 (2000)]. By means of exit-time statistics it is shown that the
deviations from Richardson's law are a consequence of Eulerian intermittency.
The measured Lagrangian scaling exponents require a set of Eulerian structure
function exponents $\zeta_{p}$ which are remarkably close to standard ones
known for fully developed turbulence.

demonstrate it on data analyzed in two dimensions (chosen from the eigenvectors

limiting the evaluation of the Schrodinger potential to the locations of data

light-harvesting complexes is studied with a novel approach which combines
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with quantum chemistry (QC) calculations.
The MD simulations of an LH-II complex, solvated and embedded in a lipid
bilayer at physiological conditions (with total system size of 87,055 atoms)
revealed a pathway of a water molecule into the B800 binding site, as well as
increased dimerization within the B850 BChl ring, as compared to the
dimerization found for the crystal structure. The fluctuations of pigment (B850
BChl) excitation energies, as a function of time, were determined via ab initio
QC calculations based on the geometries that emerged from the MD simulations.
  From the results of these calculations we constructed a time-dependent
Hamiltonian of the B850 exciton system from which we determined the linear
absorption spectrum. Finally, a polaron model is introduced to describe quantum
mechanically both the excitonic and vibrational (phonon) degrees of freedom.
The exciton-phonon coupling that enters into the polaron model, and the
corresponding phonon spectral function are derived from the MD/QC simulations.
It is demonstrated that, in the framework of the polaron model, the absorption
spectrum of the B850 excitons can be calculated from the autocorrelation
function of the excitation energies of individual BChls, which is readily
available from the combined MD/QC simulations. The obtained result is in good
agreement with the experimentally measured absorption spectrum.
