massive stars during which the central region collapses, forms a neutron star

the ejection is due to energy deposition by neutrinos into the envelope but
detailed models do not produce powerful explosions. There is new and mounting
evidence for an asphericity and, in particular, for axial symmetry in several
SNe which may be hard to reconcile within the spherical picture. This evidence
includes the observed high polarization and its variation with time, pulsar
kicks, high velocity iron-group and intermediate-mass elements material in

must invoke some sort of axial symmetry for the explosion. As limiting case, we
consider jet-induced/dominated explosions of ""classical"" core collapse SNe. Our
study is based on detailed 3-D hydro and radiation transport models. The jet
properties and of the progenitor structure influence on the final density and
chemical structure. Our calculations show that low velocity, massive jets can
explain the observations. Both asymmetric ionization and density/chemical
distributions have been identified as crucial for the formation of asymmetric
photospheres. Even within the picture of jet-induced explosion, the latter

significant Baldwin Effect in UV iron emission. Further analysis reveals that
the primary correlation of iron emission strength is probably with redshift,

important place to study accretion onto white dwarfs since they are candidate
Type Ia supernovae progenitors. Unlike in most cataclysmic variables, the white
dwarfs in symbiotics typically accrete from a wind, at rates greater than or
equal to 10^{-9} solar masses per year. In order to elucidate the differences
between symbiotics and other white dwarf accretors, as well as search for
magnetism in symbiotic white dwarfs, we have studied 35 primarily northern
symbiotic binaries via differential optical photometry. Our study is the most
comprehensive to date of rapid variability in symbiotic binaries. We have found
one magnetic accretor, Z And, previously reported by Sokoloski & Bildsten
(1999). In four systems (EG And, BX Mon, CM Aql, and BF Cyg), some evidence for
flickering at a low level (roughly 10 mmag) is seen for the first time. These
detections are, however, marginal. For 25 systems, we place tight upper limits
(order of mmag) on both aperiodic and periodic variability, highlighting a
major difference between symbiotics and cataclysmic variables. The remaining
five of the objects included in our sample (the 2 recurrent novae RS Oph and T
CrB, plus CH Cyg, o Ceti, and MWC 560) had previous detections of
large-amplitude optical flickering, and we present our extensive observations
of these systems in a separate paper. We discuss the impact of our results on
the ``standard'' picture of wind-fed accretion, and speculate on the
possibility that in most symbiotics, light from quasi-steady nuclear burning on
the surface of the white dwarf hides the fluctuating emission from accretion.

lines of hydrogen from an accretion disk superposed with absorption lines of a

late-type stellar template spectra reveals a sinusoidal variation in radial
velocity with amplitude K = 701 +/- 10 km/s and orbital period P = 0.169930 +/-
0.000004 d. The mass function, 6.1 +/- 0.3 solar masses, is a firm lower limit
on the mass of the compact object and strongly implies that it is a black hole.
Photometric observations (R-band) with the IAC 0.8 m telescope reveal
ellipsoidal light variations of full amplitude 0.2 mag. Modeling gives a large
mass ratio (M1/M2 ~ 20) and a high orbital inclination (i = 81 +/- 2 deg). Our
combined fits yield a mass of the black hole in the range M1 = 6.0-7.7 solar
masses (90% confidence) for plausible secondary star masses of M2 = 0.09-0.5
solar masses. The photometric period measured during the outburst is 0.5%
longer than our orbital period and probably reflects superhump modulations as
observed in some other soft X-ray transients. The estimated distance is d = 1.9

produced by neutrino-induced showers in water and develop an optimal filtering
algorithm able to suppress statistical noise. The algorithm found is
computationally appropriate to be used as a trigger for the signal processors

their intrinsic 0.5-10 keV luminosities range from approx. 2E37 erg/s to 4E39

range of spectral properties. The properties of the two strongest off-nuclear

function might be very different in different locations. The luminosity
function might be sharply rising in rich clusters and flat or declining in
regions of low density. If galaxies form according to the model of hierarchical
clustering then there should be many small halos compared to the number of big
halos. If this theory is valid then there must be a mechanism that eliminates
at least the visible component of galaxies in low density regions. A plausible
mechanism is photoionization of the intergalactic medium at a time before the
epoch of galaxy formation in low density regions but after the epoch of
formation for systems that ultimately end up in rich clusters. The dynamical
timescales are found to accommodate this hypothesis in a flat universe with
Omega_m < 0.4.
  If this idea has validity, then upon surveying a variety of environments it
is expected that a dichotomy will emerge. There should be a transition between
high density / high frequency of dwarfs to lower density / low frequency of
dwarfs. This transition should ultimately be understood by the matching of
three timing considerations: (i) the collapse timescale of the transition
density, (ii) the timescale of reionization, and (iii) the linkage given by the
cosmic expansion timescale as controlled by the dark matter and dark energy
content of the universe.

T CrB, RS Oph, V745 Sco, and V3890 Sgr. Our model includes irradiations of the
companion star and the accretion disk together with a shadowing effect on the
companion by the accretion disk. The early visual light curves are well
reproduced with a thermonuclear runaway model on a very massive white dwarf of
1.37 Mo for T CrB, 1.37 Mo for RS Oph with low metallicity (Z=0.004), 1.35 Mo
for V745 Sco, and 1.35 Mo for V3890 Sgr. Each envelope mass at the optical
maximum is also estimated to be 3 x 10^{-6}, 2 x 10^{-6}, 5 x 10^{-6}, and 3 x
10^{-6} Mo, indicating an average mass accretion rate of 0.4 x 10^{-7}, 1.2 x
10^{-7}, 0.9 x 10^{-7}, and 1.1 x 10^{-7} Mo/yr during the quiescent phase.
Although a large part of the envelope mass is blown in the wind, each WD can
retain a substantial part of the envelope mass after hydrogen burning ends.
Thus, we have obtained net mass-increasing rates of the WDs as 0.1 x 10^{-7},
0.12 x 10^{-7}, 0.05 x 10^{-7}, and 0.11 x 10^{-7} Mo/yr. These results
strongly indicate that the WDs in the recurrent novae have now grown up to near
the Chandrasekhar mass limit and will soon explode as a Type Ia supernova if
the WDs consist of carbon and oxygen. We also include a radiation-induced
warping instability of the accretion disk to reproduce the second peak of T CrB

  20-27 (2001)",,,,"astro-ph hep-ph",,"  Observations imply that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are produced by the
dissipation of the kinetic energy of a highly relativistic fireball.
Photo-meson interactions of protons with gamma-rays within the fireball
dissipation region are expected to convert a significant fraction of the
fireball energy into high energy neutrinos. In this talk we summarize the
results of an analysis of the internal shock model of GRBs, where production of
synchrotron photons and photo-meson neutrinos with energies about 10^14 eV are
self-consistently calculated. These neutrinos will be coincident with the GRB.
We show that the fraction of fireball energy converted into high energy
neutrinos is not sensitive to uncertainties in the fireball model parameters,
such as the expansion Lorentz factor and characteristic variability time. Other
processes of neutrinos emission from GRBs are also reviewed. Photomeson
interactions within the plasma region shocked by the reverse shock, may produce
a burst of 10^18 eV neutrinos following the GRB on the time scale of 10 s.
Inelastic p-n nuclear collisions result in the production of a burst of around
10 GeV neutrinos in coincidence with the GRB. Planned 1 km^3 neutrino
telescopes are expected to detect ten 100 TeV neutrino events and several 10^18
eV events, correlated with GRBs, per year. A suitably densely spaced detector
may allow the detection of several 10 GeV events per year.

effective temperature, metallicity, mass and age, offering an opportunity to
investigate the behaviour of Li as a function of these parameters. An
interesting result is the presence of a large gap in the Li-Teff plane, which
distinguishes `Hyades-like, Li-dip' stars from other stars. These Li-dip stars
have a well-defined mass, which decreases with metallicity. Stars above the
gap, when divided into four metallicity groups, may show a correlation between
Li abundance and stellar mass, but with a large dispersion that cannot be
explained by observational errors or differences in metallicity and age, which
ranges from 1.5 to 15 Gyr. This suggests that Li depletion occurs early in
stellar life and that other parameters, e.g. initial rotation velocity and/or
the rate of angular momentum loss, affect the degree of depletion. A comparison
of the distribution of stars in the Li-[Fe/H] plane with evolutionary models of
Romano et al. (1999) suggests that novae are a major source for the Li
production in the Galactic disk.

the interactions, viewing little black holes (LBH) as a class of elementary
particles puts them in a league with hadrons as strongly interacting particles.
They interact strongly both in the subatomic and macroscopic realms. An
enormous universal gravitational attractive force ~ 10^43 /B 2 Newtons acts
between identical black holes for any mass M >> M Planck at a center-to-center
separation of 2 BR H (B > 1). For M ~ M Planck, there is a comparably large
repulsive force. The Hawking model of LBH radiation permits a luminosity from a
single LBH comparable to that of the entire universe, whereas this luminosity
is greatly attenuated in the Rabinowitz model. In interacting with each other,
and with large macroscopic bodies such as stars, neutron stars, and planets,
LBH can exhibit strong interactions with large-scale manifestations. Although
previously dismissed, an LBH is a potential candidate in accounting for the

and their velocities relative to the earth. Most BL features can be explained
by a testable LBH model. Analyses are presented to support this model. LBH
produce complex and many-faceted interactions in air directly and via their
exhaust, resulting in excitation, ionization, and radiation due to processes
such as gravitational and electrostatic tidal force, bremsstrahlung, pair
production and annihilation, orbital electron near-capture by interaction with
a charged LBH. Gravitational interaction of atmospheric atoms with LBH can
result in an enhanced cross-section for polarization and ionization. An
estimate for the power radiated by BL ~ Watts is in agreement with observation.
An upper limit is found for the largest masses that can produce ionization and
polarization excitation. It is shown that the LBH high power exhaust radiation
is not prominent and its effects are consistent with observations.

inhomogeneities into the RG procedure. Inhomogeneities are modeled by a smooth
random potential with a correlator which falls off with distance as a power
law, r^{-alpha}. Similar to the classical percolation, we observe an
enhancement of nu with decreasing alpha. Although the attainable system sizes
are large, they do not allow one to unambiguously identify a cusp in the
nu(alpha) dependence at alpha_c=2/nu, as might be expected from the extended
Harris criterion. We argue that the fundamental obstacle for the numerical
detection of a cusp in the quantum percolation is the implicit randomness in
the Aharonov-Bohm phases of the wave functions. This randomness emulates the
presence of a short-range disorder alongside the smooth potential.

nondeterministic in the sense that the selection of program clauses is not
determined. Examples are the familiar ""demo"" and ""vanilla"" metainterpreters.
For some applications this nondeterminism is convenient. In some cases,
however, a deterministic metainterpreter, having an explicit selection of
clauses, is needed. Such cases include (1) conversion of OR parallelism into
AND parallelism for ""committed-choice"" processors, (2) logic-based,
imperative-language implementation of search strategies, and (3) simulation of

  Deterministic metainterpreters are difficult to write because the programmer
must be concerned about the set of unifiers of the children of a node in the
derivation tree. We argue that it is both possible and advantageous to write
these metainterpreters by reasoning in terms of object programs converted into
a syntactically restricted form that we call ""chain"" form, where we can forget
about unification, except for unit clauses. We give two transformations
converting logic programs into chain form, one for ""moded"" programs (implicit

Lorentzian geometry'' is a common and generic result of linearizing a field
theory around some non-trivial background. This investigation is motivated by
considering the large number of ``analog models'' of general relativity that
have recently been developed based on condensed matter physics, and asking
whether there is something more fundamental going on. Indeed, linearization of
a classical field theory (a field theoretic ``normal mode analysis'') results
in fluctuations whose propagation is governed by a Lorentzian-signature curved
spacetime ``effective metric''. For a single scalar field, this procedure
results in a unique effective metric, which is quite sufficient for simulating
kinematic aspects of general relativity (up to and including Hawking
radiation). Quantizing the linearized fluctuations, the one-loop effective
action contains a term proportional to the Einstein--Hilbert action, suggesting
that while classical physics is responsible for generating an ``effective
geometry'', quantum physics can be argued to induce an ``effective dynamics''.
The situation is strongly reminiscent of Sakharov's ``induced gravity''
scenario, and suggests that Einstein gravity is an emergent low-energy
long-distance phenomenon that is insensitive to the details of the high-energy
short-distance physics. (We mean this in the same sense that hydrodynamics is a
long-distance emergent phenomenon, many of whose predictions are insensitive to
the short-distance cutoff implicit in molecular dynamics.)

how to change the usual definition of various physical quantities in order to
make physics in 4D invariant under transformations in 5D. These include the
redefinition of the electromagnetic tensor, force and Christoffel symbols. With
our definitions, each of the force terms in the equation of motion is gauge
invariant and orthogonal to the four-velocity of the particle. The ""hidden""
parameter associated with the rate of motion along the extra dimension is
identified with the electric charge, regardless of whether there is an
electromagnetic field or not. In addition, for charged particles, the
charge-to-mass ratio should vary. Therefore, the motion of a charged particle
should differ from the motion of a neutral particle, with the same initial mass
and energy, even in the absence of electromagnetic field. These predictions
have important implications and could in principle be experimentally detected.

Condensate (DCC) forms when hot hadronic matter is quenched, using the linear
sigma model. We formulate an original sampling strategy for the initial field
configuration in order to get an estimate of the probability that a potentially
observable coherent pion field appears in a heavy-ion collision. We obtain a
probability of the order of 1/1000 at CERN SPS energies. Next, we study the
correlation between isospin orientations of the distinct modes of the pion
field emerging after a quench. We show that this correlation is absent: the
distinct modes behave as distinct DCCs. This contradicts the common belief that
the state produced in the simplest form of the quench scenario - with a fully
thermalized initial state - is identical to the originally proposed DCC. In the
second part, we investigate the role of elastic scatterings in the process of
kinetic equilibration of gluons produced in the very early times of the
collision. We compare the two available scenarios describing the initial
conditions: saturation and minijet production. We treat the elastic processes
in the small scattering angle limit and work in the relaxation time
approximation. By measuring the isotropy of different observables as a function
of time, we show that the usual assumption that elastic collisions are
efficient enough to rapidly achieve kinetic equilibrium is not reliable. Due to
the longitudinal expansion at early times, the actual equilibration time is an
order of magnitude bigger than the typical 1 fm estimate usually assumed.

for the first time yield multiple pairs of c-cbar in each central event. If a
region of deconfined quarks and gluons is subsequently formed, a new mechanism
for the formation of heavy quarkonium bound states will be activated. This will
result from the mobility of heavy quarks in the deconfined region, such that
bound states can be formed from a quark and an antiquark which were originally
produced in separate incoherent interactions. Our model estimates of this
effect predict a dramatic increase in the number of observed J/Psi at RHIC,
over that predicted from extrapolation of color-screening or gluon dissociation
mechanisms from the lower CERN-SPS energies. The centrality and energy
dependence of this effect should be readily observable by the Star and Phenix

signature of QGP formation. However, it is in this environment a more useful
probe, since contrary to prior expectations this large predicted J/Psi

electroweak standard model (SM). In the SM the violation of CP in the weak
interactions has a single source: the phase of the quark mixing matrix (the CKM
matrix, for Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa). Most extensions of the SM exhibit new
sources of CP violation. For instance, the truly minimal supersymmetric
extension of the SM (CMSSM) has two new phases in addition to the CKM phase.
Given that CP violation is so tiny in the kaon system, is still largely
unexplored in B physics and is negligibly small in the electric dipole moments,
it is clear that new physics may have a good chance to manifest some departure
from the SM in this particularly challenging class of rare phenomena. On the
other hand, it is also apparent that CP violation generally represents a major
constraint on any attempt at model building beyond the SM. In this review we
tackle these two sides of the relation between CP violation and new physics.
Our focus will be on the potentialities to use CP violation as a probe on
Supersymmetric (SUSY) extensions of the SM. We wish to clarify the extent to
which such indirect signals for SUSY are linked to a fundamental theoretical
issue: is there a relation between the mechanism that originates the whole
flavor structure and the mechanism that is responsible for the breaking of
supersymmetry? Different ways to answer this question lead to quite different
expectations for CP violation in B physics.

obtained by joining the individual Wilson lines together by a series of
well-defined cutting and joining manipulations. For closed loops, we find that
the non-planar contributions do not have a smooth limit in the limit of
vanishing non-commutativity and hence the equations do not reduce to their
commutative counterparts. We use the Schwinger-Dyson equations to derive loop
equations for the correlators of Wilson observables. In the planar limit, this
gives us a {\it new} loop equation which relates the correlators of Wilson
lines to the expectation values of closed Wilson loops. We discuss perturbative
verification of the loop equation for the 2-point function in some detail. We
also suggest a possible connection between Wilson line based on an arbitrary

of motion have two marginal directions for which the Lyapunov exponents vanish.
Those directions are the tangent one to a Hamiltonian flow and the gradient one
of the Hamiltonian function. To separate out these two directions and to apply
Lyapunov analysis effectively in directions for which Lyapunov exponents are
not trivial, a geometric method is proposed for natural Hamiltonian systems, in
particular. In this geometric method, Hamiltonian flows of a natural
Hamiltonian system are regarded as geodesic flows on the cotangent bundle of a
Riemannian manifold with a suitable metric. Stability/instability of the
geodesic flows is then analyzed by linearized equations of motion which are
related to the Jacobi equations on the Riemannian manifold. On some geometric
setting on the cotangent bundle, it is shown that along a geodesic flow in
question, there exist Lyapunov vectors such that two of them are in the two
marginal directions and the others orthogonal to the marginal directions. It is
also pointed out that Lyapunov vectors with such properties can not be obtained
in general by the usual method which uses linearized Hamilton's equations of
motion. Furthermore, it is observed from numerical calculation for a model
system that Lyapunov exponents calculated in both methods, geometric and usual,
coincide with each other, independently of the choice of the methods.

derived from the collisional kinetic equation. The memory effects are caused by
the Fermi surface distortions and depend on the relaxation time. It is shown
that the nuclear collective motion and the nuclear fission are influenced
strongly by the memory effects at the relaxation time $\tau \geq 5\cdot
10^{-23}{\rm s}$. In particular, the descent of the nucleus from the fission
barrier is accompanied by characteristic shape oscillations. The eigenfrequency
and the damping of the shape oscillations depend on the contribution of the
memory integral in the equations of motion. The shape oscillations disappear at
the short relaxation time regime at $\tau \to 0$, which corresponds to the
usual Markovian motion in the presence of friction forces. We show that the
elastic forces produced by the memory integral lead to a significant delay for
the descent of the nucleus from the barrier. Numerical calculations for the
nucleus $^{236}$U shows that due to the memory effect the saddle-to-scission
time grows by a factor of about 3 with respect to the corresponding
saddle-to-scission time obtained in liquid drop model calculations with
friction forces.

based on the close relationship of controllers to communication channels. A
communication channel takes an input state and transforms it into an output
state. A controller, similarly, takes the initial state of a system to be
controlled and transforms it into a target state. In this sense, a controller
can be thought of as an actuation channel that acts on inputs to produce
desired outputs. In this transformation process, two different control
strategies can be adopted: (i) the controller applies an actuation dynamics
that is independent of the state of the system to be controlled (open-loop
control); or (ii) the controller enacts an actuation dynamics that is based on
some information about the state of the controlled system (closed-loop
control). Using this communication channel model of control, we provide
necessary and sufficient conditions for a system to be perfectly controllable
and perfectly observable in terms of information and entropy. In addition, we
derive a quantitative trade-off between the amount of information gathered by a
closed-loop controller and its relative performance advantage over an open-loop
controller in stabilizing a system. This work supplements earlier results [H.
Touchette, S. Lloyd, Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 1156 (2000)] by providing new
derivations of the advantage afforded by closed-loop control and by proposing
an information-based optimality criterion for control systems. New applications
of this approach pertaining to proportional controllers, and the control of
chaotic maps are also presented.

additional tensor has been introduced containing a charge density, analogous to

electromagnetic fields has not been considered in this work.) The metric
components in the new equations may contain charge and mass contributions. In
the special relativistic case a set of four vacuum Maxwell equations is
obtained from the new equations containing a special relativistic charge
density. A related result was recently found by Jefimenko from a special
relativistic transformation. Moreover, from the postulated equations the usual
special relativistic electric energy and Lorentz force can be calculated, when
the approximated electromagnetic metric is used. In the non-relativistic case
the usual Maxwell equations with rest charge density are obtained. In the
presence of a static gravitational field a set of four Maxwell equations is
obtained applying in the general relativistic case. From these equations the
generally accepted isotropic velocity of light can be deduced. In addition,
calculated generalized Maxwell equations show that vacuum permittivity and
permeability may differ from unity value in the presence of a big charge Q or a
big mass M.

evolution of a K0-K0bar quantum entangled pair created in the decay of the

local hidden-variable model fails in reproducing the whole set of
quantum-mechanical observables. We achieve this conclusion by employing two
different approaches. In the first approach, the local realistic observables
are deduced from the most general premises concerning locality and realism, and
Bell-like inequalities are not employed. The other approach makes use of Bell's
inequalities. Under particular conditions for the detection times, within the
first approach the discrepancy between quantum mechanics and local realism for
the asymmetry parameter turns out to be not less than 20%. A similar
incompatibility can be made evident by means of a Bell-type test, by employing
a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt's inequality written in terms of properly
normalized observables. Because of its relatively low experimental accuracy,
the data obtained by the CPLEAR collaboration do not yet allow a decisive test
of local realism. Such a test, both with and without the use of Bell's
inequalities, should be feasible in the future at the Frascati Phi-factory.
