  case of 3C 295","corrected author addresses and type error in Eq.3",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20010484",,"astro-ph",,"  Inverse Compton (IC) scattering of nuclear photons with relativistic
electrons in the lobes of powerful radio galaxies and quasars can give
detectable extended X-ray emission from the radio lobes if relativistic
electrons with a Lorentz factor gamma about 300 are present (Brunetti, Setti,
Comastri 1997). In general these electrons are not detected since they emit
synchrotron radiation at frequencies below the radio band, so that the study of
this effect provides a unique tool to measure the energy distribution of the
electron population in the radio lobes at gamma lower than 1000. In this paper
we reanalyze the Chandra observation of the powerful and compact radio galaxy
3C 295 for which the IC scattering of nuclear photons is expected to be an
important mechanism. We find strong evidence for extended and asymmetrical
X-ray emission associated with the radio lobes in the energy band 0.1--2 keV.
We show that both the luminosity and morphology of the extended X-ray emission
associated with the radio lobes, not compatible with other X-ray mechanisms,
can be best interpreted by the IC scattering with nuclear photons. We also show
that the relativistic electron energy distribution obtained from the
synchrotron radio emission can be extrapolated down to gamma about 100 thus
providing a first direct evidence on the electron spectrum in the lobes down to
lower energies.

oscillation (HBO) frequencies and kilohertz (kHz) QPO frequencies, the
difference between the low-frequency QPOs in atoll sources and HBOs in Z
sources, and the correlation between the frequencies of low-frequency QPOs and
break frequencies can be well explained by the transition layer model, provided
the neutron star mass is around 1.4 solar mass and the angle between
magnetosphere equator and accretion disk plane is around 6 degree. The observed
decrease of peak separation between two kHz QPO frequencies with the increase
of kHz QPO frequencies and the increase of QPO frequencies with the increase of
inferred mass accretion rate are also consistent with the theoretical
predictions of transition layer model. In addition, we derive a simple equation
that can be adopted to estimate the angle ($\delta$) between magnetosphere
equator and accretion disk plane by use of the simultaneously observed QPO
frequency data. We estimate these angles, in the range of 4 to 8 degrees, for
five Z sources and two atoll sources. The nearly constant $\delta$ value for
each source, derived from the different sets of simultaneously observed QPO
frequency data, provides a strong test of the theoretical model. Finally, we
suggest that the similar transition layer oscillations may be also responsible
for the observed QPOs in accretion-powered millisecond X-ray pulsar and

most powerful tools to study the expansion history of the universe and thereby
its energy components. While the analysis of some ~50 supernovae at redshifts
around z~0.5 have provided strong evidence for an energy component with

thickness in quench-condensed $Bi$ films. The resistive transitions of the
superconducting films are smooth and can be considered to represent
""homogeneous"" films. The observation of an IST very close to the quantum
resistance for pairs, $R_{\Box}^N \sim h/4e^2$ on several substrates supports
this idea. The relevant length scales here are the localization length, and the
coherence length. However, at the transition, the localization length is much
higher than the superconducting coherence length, contrary to expectation for a
""homogeneous"" transition. This suggests the invalidity of a purely fermionic
model for the transition. Furthermore, the current-voltage characteristics of
the superconducting films are hysteretic, and show the films to be granular.
The relevant energy scales here are the Josephson coupling energy and the
charging energy. However, Josephson coupling energies ($E_J$) and the charging
energies ($E_c$) at the IST, they are found to obey the relation $E_J < E_c$.
This is again contrary to expectation, for the IST in a granular or
inhomogeneous, system. Hence, a purely bosonic picture of the transition is
also inconsistent with our observations. We conclude that the IST observed in
our experiments may be either an intermediate case between the fermioinc and
bosonic mechanisms, or in a regime of charge and vortex dynamics for which a
quantitative analysis has not yet been done.

antiquarks ($\lambda_s$) produced in partic le and nuclear collisions, is found
to increase in collisions with initially reached energy density ($\epsilon_i$)
up to $\epsilon_{crit}$ $\sim$ 1 GeV/$fm^3$. Above this value it decreases
approximately linearly and reaches its asymptotic value at zero baryon chemical
potential ($\mu_B$). We demonstrate that $\lambda_s$ in nuclear collisions is
approaching its asymptotic value at $\epsilon_i$ $\sim$ 8-9 GeV/$fm^3$,
corresponding to $\sqrt{s}$ $\sim$ 3-8 TeV per nucleon+nucleon pair which will
be reached at the LHC. After correcting for the difference in the chemical
potentials of various colliding systems, $\lambda_s$ universally saturates
across the QCD phase boundary, following the temperature. Recent experimental
puzzles as the increase in the $K/\pi$ ratio in Pb+Pb collisions at 40 GeV per
nucleon, its different behaviour at midrapidity, the decrease of the double
ratio of $K/\pi$(A+A/p+p) in nucleus nucleus over p+p collisions with
increasing $\sqrt{s}$, and the increase of $\lambda_s$ in p+A over p+p
collisions at the same $\sqrt{s}$, are naturally explained. We study the
approach of thermodynamic observables at $\mu_B=0$ to the transition point and
extract an estimate of the critical temperature.

In the Quantum theory the observed values are the average value of operators.
Since the wave functions create a full and orthonormalized space, the average
values of operators coincide with eigenvalues of operators. This situation
takes place in the case of strong and electromagnetic interactions. However,
the average values of the weak interaction operators are equal to zero since
only the left-handed components of spinors participate in the weak
interactions. It means that in these interactions the connected states cannot
exist. Then the weak interaction of the particles (scatterings, decays) can be
considered only in the framework of the standard perturbative approach. It is
shown that the weak interactions cannot generate masses and the equation for
Green's function of the weak interacting fermions (neutrinos) in the matter

dominos. For any fixed m, the numbers T(m,n) satisfy a linear recurrence
relation, and so may be extrapolated to negative values of n; these
extrapolated values satisfy the relation T(m,-2-n) = epsilon_{m,n} T(m,n),
where epsilon_{m,n} is -1 if m is congruent to 2 (mod 4) and n is odd, and is
+1 is otherwise. This is equivalent to a fact demonstrated by Stanley using
algebraic methods. Here I give a proof that provides, among other things, a
uniform combinatorial interpretation of T(m,n) that applies regardless of the

finite group `perfect' if its order is the sum of the orders of its proper
normal subgroups. (This conflicts with standard terminology but confusion
should not arise.) The notion of perfect group generalizes that of perfect
number, since a cyclic group is perfect exactly when its order is perfect. We
show that, in fact, the only abelian perfect groups are the cyclic ones, and
exhibit some non-abelian perfect groups of even order.

structure $J$, a 1-periodic time dependent symplectic vector field $Z$ and a
homotopy class of closed curves $\gamma$ we define a Floer complex based on
1-periodic trajectories of $Z$ in the homotopy class $\gamma$. We suppose that
the closed 1-form $i_{Z_t}\omega$ represents a cohomology class
$\beta(Z):=\beta$, independent of $t$. We show how to associate to
$(M,\omega,\gamma,\beta)$ and to two pairs $(Z_i,J_i)$, $i=1,2$ with
$\beta(Z_i)=\beta$ an invariant, the relative symplectic torsion, which is an
element in the Whitehead group $Wh(\Lambda_0)$, of a Novikov ring $\Lambda_0$
associated with $(M,\omega,Z,\gamma)$. If the cohomology of the Floer complex
vanishes or if $\gamma$ is trivial we derive an invariant, the symplectic
torsion for any pair $(Z,J)$.
  We prove, that when $\beta(\gamma)\neq 0$, or when $\gamma$ is non-trivial
and $\beta$ is 'small', the cohomology of the Floer complex is trivial, but the
symplectic torsion can be non-trivial. Using the first fact we conclude results
about non-contractible 1-periodic trajectories of 1-periodic symplectic vector
fields. In this version we will only prove the statements for closed weakly
monotone manifolds, but note that they remain true as formulated for arbitrary
closed symplectic manifolds.

potential of the full characterization of a radio link through the accurate
study of the propagation path of the signal from the transmitting to the
receiving antennas across a perturbed atmosphere. The ray-tracing equations are
solved, with controlled accuracy, in three dimensions (3D) and the propagation
characteristics are obtained using various refractive index models. The
launching of the rays, the atmospheric medium and its disturbances are
characterized in 3D. The novelty in the approach stems from the use of special
numerical techniques dealing with so called stiff differential equations
without which no solution of the ray-tracing equations is possible. Starting
with a given launching angle, the solution consists of the ray trajectory, the
propagation time information at each point of the path, the beam spreading, the
transmitted (resp. received) power taking account of the radiation pattern and
orientation of the antennas and finally, the polarization state of the beam.
Some previously known results are presented for comparative purposes and new
results are presented as well as some of the capabilities of the software.
