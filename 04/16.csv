actually exists coming from astrophysics and particle physics. One of the most
fascinating (but speculative) possibilities is that there is a significant
abundance of mirror matter within our solar system. If the mirror matter
condensed to form a large body of planatary or stellar mass then there could be
interesting observable effects. Indeed studies of long period comets suggest
the existence of a solar companion which has escaped direct detection and is
therefore a candidate for a mirror body. Nemesis, hypothetical ""death star""
companion of the Sun, proposed to explain biological mass extinctions, may
potentially be a mirror star. We examine the prospects for detecting these

These observations confirm that the nuclear spectrum results from reflection of
a hard X-ray continuum by ``neutral'' matter. The nuclear X-ray emission is
extended by \sim 60 pc in the general direction of the optical ``ionization
cone''. An image in the Fe K\alpha line has been made and shows that this
emission extends up to 200 pc from the nucleus. There is also large-scale X-ray
emission both along and perpendicular to the galaxy disk. Thermal plasma models
for this extended gas indicate temperatures kT \sim 0.6 keV, though cooler
photoionized gas is also possible. The X-ray emission from gas in the disk is
probably associated with the starburst ring of radius 150--250 pc. The gas
extending \sim 600 pc perpendicular to the disk is closely correlated with the
high-excitation optical-line emission. In addition to its soft X-ray emission,
we tentatively detect a hard component from the gas above the plane; this hard
emission may represent nuclear X-rays scattered into our line of sight by
electrons in the outflowing wind. Ten compact sources are found in the central
kpc of the galaxy. The most luminous has an X-ray luminosity of \simeq 10^{40}
erg s^{-1} and seems to be an X-ray binary in the Circinus galaxy with a
black-hole mass exceeding 80 M_{\odot}.

have been performed to quantify the influence of the main sequence mass M(MS)

effects of progenitors on the brightness decline relation M(dM_15) which is a
corner stone for the use of SNe Ia as cosmological yard-stick.M(MS) has been
identified as the decisive factor to change the energetics of the explosion and
dominates the variations in the rise-time to decline relation of light curves.
M(MS) has little effect on the color index B-V. For similar decline rates
dM_15, the flux at maximum brightness relative to the flux on the radioactive
tail decreases systematically with M(MS) by about 0.2mag. This change goes
along with a reduc- tion of the photospheric expansion velocity $v_{ph}$ by
about 2000 km/sec. A change in the central density has the opposite dependency.
The metallicity Z affects mainly the intrinsic color index B-V by up to
-0.06mag, and it alters the fluxes in the U band and the UV. B-V is critical if
extinction corrections are applied. The spread in the fiducial rise-time to
decline relation in local SNe Ia restricts the range of main sequence masses to
a factor of 2. The upper limit of 1 day for the difference between the local
and distance sample support the need for a positive cosmological constant. The
size of evolutionary effects are small (dM abou 0.2mag) but are absolutely

explain realistic mass relations for quarks and leptons, we take into account
effects of higher dimensional operators above the GUT scale. It is shown that
the supersymmetric (SUSY) contributions to the CP violation parameter in
$K^0-\bar{K}^0$ mixing, $\epsilon_K$, the $\mu \to e \gamma$ branching ratio,
and the muon anomalous magnetic moment become large in a wide range of
parameter space. We also investigate correlations among these quantities.
Within the current experimental bound of $\text{B}(\mu \to e \gamma)$, large
SUSY contributions are possible either in the muon anomalous magnetic moment or
in $\epsilon_K$. In the former case, the favorable value of the recent muon
anomalous magnetic moment measurement at the BNL E821 experiment can be
accommodated. In the latter case, the allowed region of the Kobayashi-Maskawa
phase can be different from the prediction within the Standard Model (SM) and
therefore the measurements of the CP asymmetry of $B\to J/\psi K_S$ mode and
$\Delta m_{B_s}$ could discriminate this case from the SM. We also show that
the $\tau \to \mu \gamma$ branching ratio can be close to the current
experimental upperbound and the mixing induced CP asymmetry of the radiative B
decay can be enhanced in the case where the neutrino parameters correspond to
the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein small mixing angle solution.

Objections against this proposal are discussed and necessary (but not
sufficient) conditions are stated under which it may work. At least n=2 extra
dimensions are needed. Also, the mass matrix in the supergravity sector must
satisfy $Str M^2=0$. Moreover, the proposal can be ruled out experimentally if
Newton's constant remains unchanged down to scales of 10 micrometers. If, on
the other hand, such a ``running Newton constant'' is observed, it could
provide crucial experimental input for superstring phenomenology.

Algebra, then for each element of the semigroup a (generalized) projection
operator exists that is defined on the entire Geometric Algebra. A single
fundamental theorem holds for all (generalized) projection operators. This
theorem makes previous projection operator formulas equivalent to each other.
The class of generalized projection operators includes the familiar subspace
projection operation by implementing the automorphism `grade involution' and
the anti-automorphism `inverse' on the semigroup of invertible versors. This
class of projection operators is studied in some detail as the natural
generalization of the subspace projection operators. Other generalized
projection operators include projections onto any invertible element, or a
weighted projection onto any element. This last projection operator even
implies a possible projection operator for the zero element.

singlet $^1S$ and triplet $^3S+^3D$ channels. The complete Hilbert space is
split into two domains, the model subspace $S_0$, in which the two-particle
propagator is calculated explicitly, and the complementary one, $S'$, in which
the local potential approximation is used. This kind of local approximation was
previously found to be quite accurate for the $^1S$ pairing problem. A set of
model spaces $S_0(E_0)$ with different values of the cut-off energy $E_0$ is
considered, $E_0$ being the upper limit for the single-particle energies of the
states belonging to $S_0$. The independence of the G-matrix of $E_0$ is assumed
as a criterion of validity of the local potential approximation. Such
independence is obtained within few percent for $E_0=10 \div 20$ MeV for both
the channels under consideration.

  an application to Single Mode Laser Diodes","11 pages, no figures. Submitted to Phys. Rev. A (April 2001)",,,,"physics.optics",,"  Harmonic and Intermodulation distortions occur when a physical system is
excited with a single or several frequencies and when the relationship between
the input and output is non-linear. Working with non-linearities in the
Frequency domain is not straightforward specially when the relationship between
the input and output is not trivial. We outline the complete derivation of the
Harmonic and Intermodulation distortions from basic principles to a general
physical system. For illustration, the procedure is applied to the Single Mode
laser diode where the relationship of input to output is non-trivial. The
distortions terms are extracted directly from the Laser Diode rate equations
and the method is tested by comparison to many results cited in the literature.
This methodology is general enough to be applied to the extraction of
distortion terms to any desired order in many physical systems in a general and
systematic way.
