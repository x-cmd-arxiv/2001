HST imaging data on the two galaxies, which are presented in Augusto et al. In
the present study, we focus on reproducing the widest separated,
observationally similar radio components A and D as lensed images. We first
treat G2 (which is the more distant one from the geometric centre) as a shear
term, and then consider two plane lensing explicitly including G2's potential
at the $z_2$ plane as the first case of two plane lens modelling. Our modelling
results not only support the hypothesis that the system includes
gravitationally lensed images of a higher redshift extragalactic object, but
they also show that the explicit inclusion of G2's potential at the second lens
plane is necessary in order to fit the data with astrophysically plausible
galaxy parameters. Finally, we illustrate a natural consequence of a two-plane
lens system, namely the prediction of distortion as well as shift and
stretching of G2's isophotes by G1's potential, which can in principle be
measured by subtracting out G1's light distribution in a high S/N and good
angular resolution image, especially a multi-colour one.

z(abs) = 2.0762 damped Lyman alpha system (DLA) along this sight-line. The
velocity structure of this absorber is very simple and its neutral hydrogen
column density, N(H I), is accurately known; the error in D/H is mostly due to
the limited signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum. Since this is also one of
the most metal-poor DLAs, with metal abundances of about 1/200 of solar, the
correction due to astration of D is expected to be insignificant and the value
we deduce should be essentially the primordial abundance of deuterium. When all
(six) available measurements of D/H in high redshift QSO absorbers are
considered, we find that the three DLAs---where N(H I) is measured most
reliably---give consistently lower values than the three Lyman limit systems.
We point out that the weighted mean of the DLA measurements, D/H = (2.2 +/-

within 1 sigma of the value deduced from the analysis of the CMB angular power
spectrum, and is still consistent with the present-day D/H and models of
Galactic chemical evolution. Future observations of D I absorption in other
DLAs are needed to establish whether our finding reflects a real advantage of
DLAs over other classes of QSO absorbers for the measurement of D, or is just a
statistical fluctuation.

known, PSR B1937+21 (P=1.558 msec), with ASCA. The pulsar is detected as a
point source above $\sim 1.7$ keV, with no indication of nebulosity. The source
flux in the 2--10 keV band is found to be $f = (3.7\pm 0.6) \times 10^{-13}$
erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, which implies an isotropic luminosity of $L_{\rm x} = 4
\pi D^2 f \sim (5.7\pm 1.0) \times 10^{32} ~(D/3.6 {\rm kpc})^2$ erg s$^{-1}$,
where D is the distance, and an X-ray efficiency of $\sim 5 \times 10^{-4}$
relative to the spin-down power of the pulsar.
  The pulsation is found at the period predicted by the radio ephemeris with a
very narrow primary peak, the width of which is about 1/16 phase ($\sim 100
\mu$s), near the time resolution limit ($61 \mu$s) of the observation. The
instantaneous flux in the primary peak (1/16 phase interval) is found to be
($4.0\pm 0.8) \times 10^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. Although there is an
indication for the secondary peak, we consider its statistical significance too
low to claim a definite detection.
  The narrow pulse profile and the detection in the 2--10 keV band imply that
the X-ray emission is caused by the magnetospheric particle acceleration.
Comparison of X-ray and radio arrival times of pulses indicates, within the
timing errors, that the X-ray pulse is coincident with the radio interpulse.

according to both lensing and photometric redshift criteria. All the target
galaxies are found to correspond to background galaxies with redshifts values
in the [0.7, 3.5] interval. Our spectroscopic observations confirm the
predicted lensing redshifts for 3 of the multiple-image galaxies, and together
with predictions of the NKSE model led to the discovery of a new 5-image
configuration at redshift z=3.347. A revised NKSE model, compatible with the
redshift of this new multiple-image system, was generated and employed to
calculate the gravitational amplifications of all the observed galaxies. The
galaxies corresponding to the multiple-image systems are found to be
intrinsically fainter, between 0.5 and 1.5 magnitudes, than the limiting
magnitudes of existing blank field studies. When all the observed background
galaxies are considered, the resulting intrinsic absolute magnitudes range from
M_B~-22 to -19. Therefore, a large gain in sensitivity towards low luminosity
high-z objects can actually be obtained, in agreement with theoretical
expectations. This method can be used advantageously to probe the high redshift
Universe and, in particular, its application to an ensemble of massive cluster
cores could constraint the faint end of luminosity function of high redshift
galaxies.

stars will appear inside the kernels. A kernel typically contracts to form one
of the first generation stars with an accretion rate that is as large as $\sim

result in a kernel temperature of order 1000K, and the collapsing kernel emits
H$_2$ line radiation at a rate $\sim 10^{35}$ erg sec$^{-1}$. Principally

Language Generation (NLG), such as referring expression generation, lexical
choice, and aggregation, problems in which a generator must bridge underlying
domain-specific representations and general linguistic representations. In this
paper, we describe a uniform approach to microplanning based on declarative
representations of a generator's communicative intent. These representations
describe the results of NLG: communicative intent associates the concrete
linguistic structure planned by the generator with inferences that show how the
meaning of that structure communicates needed information about some
application domain in the current discourse context. Our approach, implemented
in the SPUD (sentence planning using description) microplanner, uses the
lexicalized tree-adjoining grammar formalism (LTAG) to connect structure to
meaning and uses modal logic programming to connect meaning to context. At the
same time, communicative intent representations provide a resource for the
process of NLG. Using representations of communicative intent, a generator can
augment the syntax, semantics and pragmatics of an incomplete sentence
simultaneously, and can assess its progress on the various problems of
microplanning incrementally. The declarative formulation of communicative
intent translates into a well-defined methodology for designing grammatical and
conceptual resources which the generator can use to achieve desired
microplanning behavior in a specified domain.

relate the photon with a ``neutrino'' led to the definition of R-invariance,

of two doublet Higgs superfields responsible for the electroweak breaking and
the generation of quark and lepton masses. The original continuous R-invariance

links the divergent perturbation theory to the nonperturbative effect we argue
that the nonperturbative effect associated with the perturbation theory should
have a branch cut only along the positive real axis in the complex coupling
plane. The component in the weak coupling expansion of the nonperturbative
amplitude, which usually includes the leading term in the weak coupling
expansion, that gives rise to the branch cut can be calculated in principle
from the perturbation theory combined with some exactly calculable properties
of the nonperturbative effect. The realization of this mechanism is
demonstrated in the double well potential and the two-dimensional O(N)
nonlinear sigma model. In these models the leading term in weak coupling of the
nonperturbative effect can be obtained with good accuracy from the first terms
of the perturbation theory. Applying this mechanism to the infrared renormalon
induced nonperturbative effect in QCD, we suggest some of the QCD condensate
effects can be calculated in principle from the perturbation theory.

do not observe any sign of SSB in Monte Carlo simulations where N is as large

between shallow and deep $K^-$ optical potentials. The ($K^{-}_{\rm stop},\pi$)
reaction could provide such a test, with exclusive rates differing by over a
factor of three for the two classes of potentials. Finally, forward ($K^-,p$)
differential cross sections for the production of relatively narrow deeply
bound $K^-$ {\it nuclear} states are evaluated for deep $K^-$ optical
potentials, yielding values considerably lower than those estimated before.

  crystals and waveguides","20 pages (LaTeX) with 12 figures (EPS)",,,,"physics.optics cond-mat.dis-nn",,"  We overview our recent results on the nonlinear localized modes in
two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystals and photonic-crystal waveguides.
Employing the technique based on the Green function, we describe the existence
domains for nonlinear guided modes in photonic crystal waveguides and study
their unique properties including bistability. We also show that low-amplitude
nonlinear modes near the band edge of a reduced-symmetry 2D square-lattice
photonic crystals, which are usually unstable, can be stabilized due to
effective long-range linear and nonlinear interactions.

parametric down conversion will reveal a violation of multi-particle Bell
inequalities, in the regime of both low and high output intensity. In this case
each spatially separated system, upon which a measurement is performed, is
comprised of more than one particle. In view of the formal analogy with spin
systems, the proposal provides an opportunity to test the predictions of
quantum mechanics for spatially separated higher spin states. Here the quantum
behaviour possible even where measurements are performed on systems of large
quantum (particle) number may be demonstrated. Our proposal applies to both
vacuum-state signal and idler inputs, and also to the quantum-injected
parametric amplifier as studied by De Martini et al. The effect of detector
inefficiencies is included.
