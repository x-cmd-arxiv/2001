Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051 with the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating
Spectrometer and the HST Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. The X-ray
grating spectrum reveals absorption and emission lines from hydrogen-like and
helium-like ions of O, Ne, Mg and Si. We resolve two distinct X-ray absorption
systems: a high-velocity blueshifted system at -2340+/-130 km/s and a
low-velocity blueshifted system at -600+/-130 km/s. In the UV spectrum we
detect strong absorption, mainly from C IV, N V and Si IV, that is resolved
into as many as nine different intrinsic absorption systems with velocities
between -650 km/s and 30 km/s. Although the low-velocity X-ray absorption is
consistent in velocity with many of the UV absorption systems, the
high-velocity X-ray absorption seems to have no UV counterpart. In addition to
the absorption and emission lines, we also observe rapid X-ray variability and
a state of low X-ray flux during the last ~15 ks of the observation. NGC 4051
has a soft X-ray excess which we fit in both the high and low X-ray flux
states. The high-resolution X-ray spectrum directly reveals that the soft
excess is not composed of narrow emission lines and that it has significant
spectral curvature. A power-law model fails to fit it, while a blackbody
produces a nearly acceptable fit. We compare the observed spectral variability
with the results of previous studies of NGC 4051.

main-sequence mass donor requires a nearly face-on inclination and a higher
<\dot M> than observed. However, the range of allowed inclinations is
substantially relaxed and the predicted mass transfer rate is consistent with
that observed if a hot 0.05 M_sun BD is the donor. We then explain the BD
radius required (0.13 R_\sun) to fill the Roche lobe. All transiently accreting
neutron stars have a minimum luminosity in quiescence set by the time-averaged
mass transfer rate onto the neutron star. We show that the constant heating of
the BD by this emission can maintain the higher entropy implied by a 0.13
R_\sun radius. Our work bolsters the case that SAX J1808.4-3658 is a progenitor
to compact ms radio pulsar binaries (e.g. like those found in 47 Tuc). The very
low <\dot M>'s implies that the progenitors to these radio pulsars are
long-lived (Gyrs) transient systems, rather than short-lived (Myrs)

present 2(1/2)D magnetohydrodinamic numerical simulations of the effects of a
solar-like magnetic cycle, with periodic polarity inversions, in the slow wind
of an AGB star. The stellar wind is modeled with a steady mass-loss at constant
velocity. This simple version of a solar-like cycle, without mass-loss
variations, is able to reproduce many properties of the observed concentric
rings. The shells are formed by pressure oscillations, which drive compressions
in the magnetized wind. These pressure oscillations are due to periodic
variations in the field intensity. The periodicity of the shells, then, is
simply a half of the magnetic cycle since each shell is formed when the
magnetic pressure goes to zero during the polarity inversion. As a consequence
of the steady mass-loss rate, the density of the shells scales as $r^{-2}$, and
their surface brightness has a steeper drop-off, as observed in the shells of
NGC 6543, the best documented case of these HST rings. Deviations from
sphericity can be generated by changing the strength of the magnetic field. For
sufficiently strong fields, a series of symmetric and equisdistant blobs are
formed at the polar axis, resembling the ones observed in He 2-90. These blobs
are originated by magnetic collimation within the expanding AGB wind.

early-type galaxies at intermediate redshift is small, and not significant: <ln
M/L_B>(field) - <ln M/L_B>(cluster) = -0.18 +- 0.11. The M/L ratios of field
early-type galaxies evolve as \Delta (ln M/L_B) = (-1.35 +- 0.35) z, very
similar to cluster early-type galaxies. After correcting for luminosity
evolution, the FP of field early-type galaxies has a scatter 0.09 +- 0.02 in
log r_e, similar to that in local clusters. The scatter appears to be driven by
low mass S0 galaxies; for the elliptical galaxies alone we find 0.03 +- 0.03.
There is a hint that the FP has a different slope than in clusters, but more
data are needed to confirm this. The similarity of the M/L ratios of cluster

their stars. At <z> = 0.43, field early-type galaxies are younger than cluster
early-type galaxies by only 21 +- 13 %, and we infer that the stars in field
early-type galaxies probably formed at z >~ 1.5. Recent semi-analytical models
for galaxy formation in a Lambda-CDM Universe predict a systematic difference
between field and cluster galaxies of \Delta (ln M/L_B) ~ -0.6, much larger
than the observed difference. This result is consistent with the hypothesis
that field early-type galaxies formed earlier than predicted by these models.

proper motion of the radio shell center of only 320 +/- 160 km/s to the south,
which limits any possible one-sided expansion of the shell. We also find that
the shell is highly circular, the outer contours in fact being circular to
within 3%. Combining our proper motion values with the degree of circular
symmetry, we find that the expansion of the shockfront from the explosion
center is isotropic to within 5.5% in the plane of the sky. This is a more
fundamental result on isotropic expansion than can be derived from the
circularity of the images alone. The brightness of the radio shell, however,
varies along the ridge and systematically changes with time. The degree of
isotropy in the expansion of the shockfront contrasts with the asymmetries and
polarization found in optical spectral lines. Asymmetric density distributions
in the ejecta or more likely in the circumstellar medium, are favored to
reconcile the radio and optical results. We see no sign of any disk-like

now show that the contribution of cold dust to the bolometric luminosity is
less than 3 per cent. Most ultraluminous infrared galaxies possess large
amounts of cold dust, and it is now known that some cooling flow cluster cD
galaxies do as well. Yet this object, which is an extreme example of both, does
not have enough cold gas to contribute significantly to the bolometric

feature encompassing the extremity of the remnant. This feature consists of
thin, tangential wisps of emission bordering the outer edge of the thermal
X-ray and radio remnant, forming a circular rim, approx. 2.7 in radius. Radio
images show a sharp rise in brightness at this X-ray rim, along with a large
jump in the synchrotron polarization angle. These characteristics suggest that
these wisps are the previously unresolved signature of the forward, or outer,
shock. Similarly, we identify the sharp rise in emissivity of the bright shell
for both the radio and X-ray line emission associated with the reverse shock.
The derived ratio of the averaged forward and reverse shock radii of approx.
3:2 constrains the remnant to have swept up roughly the same amount of mass as
was ejected; this suggests that Cas-A is just entering the Sedov phase.
Comparison of the X-ray spectra from the two shock regions shows that the
equivalent widths of prominent emission lines are significantly lower exterior
to the bright shell, as expected if they are respectively identified with the
shocked circumstellar material and shocked ejecta. Furthermore, the spectrum of
the outer rim itself is dominated by power-law emission, likely the counterpart
of the non-thermal component previously seen at energies above 10 keV.

tests confirm a slightly negatively sloped luminosity function extending to

agreement with the observed number. For those white dwarf candidates which pass

  Recent observations of distant type Ia supernovae light-curves suggest that
the expansion of the universe has recently begun to accelerate. A popular
explanation of present accelerating expansion of the universe is to assume that
some part $\Omega_Q$ of the matter-energy density is in the form of dark
component called ``the quintessence'' with the equation of state $p_Q = w
\rho_Q$ with $w \geq -1.$ In this paper we consider the predictions concerning
observations of binary inspirals in future LIGO type interferometric
experiments assuming a ``quintessence cosmology''. In particular we compute the
expected redshift distributions of observed events in the a priori admissible
range of parameters describing the equation of state for the quintessence. We
find that this distribution has a robust dependence on the cosmic equation of
state.

massive stars as their progenitors, which are likely to be surrounded by gas

A reasonable distribution of surrounding dust is capable of absorbing all the
optical and UV emission of the optical flash and afterglow of a GRB, unless the
optical flash has a peak isotropic luminosity L_peak > 10^49 erg/s. This means
that dark bursts should exist and these bursts will have to be studied at
infrared rather than optical wavelengths. In this paper details will be given
about the infrared GRB dust emission. The reprocessed dust emission peaks at a
rest-frame wavelength of about 8 micron. Forthcoming space telescopes, in
particular the IRAC camera aboard the Space Infrared Telescope Facility could
detect this emission out to a redshift of about 2. However, an accurate
position of the GRB afterglow must be provided for this emission to be
identified, because the light curve of the reprocessed dust emission does not

quantity of matter accreted from the companion which, in turn, is limited by
the mechanism of mass ejection from the binary. Mass ejection must be
efficient, at least in some cases, in order to produce the observed population
of moderately fast spinning millisecond pulsars. First we demonstrate, in the
framework of the widely accepted recycling scenario, using a population
synthesis approach, that a significant number of pulsars with spin period below
one millisecond is expected. Then we propose that significant variations in the
mass-transfer rate may cause, in systems with orbital periods larger than 1 hr,
the switch-on of a radio pulsar whose radiation pressure is capable of ejecting
out of the system most of the matter transferred by the companion and prevent
any further accretion. We show how this mechanism could dramatically alter the
binary evolution since the mechanism that drives mass overflow from the inner
Lagrangian point is still active while the accretion is inhibited. Moreover we
demonstrate that the persistency of this ``radio ejection'' phase depends on
the binary orbital period, demonstrating that close systems (orbital periods
lower than 1 hr) are the only possible hosts for ultra fast spinning neutron
stars. This could explain why submillisecond pulsars have not been detected so
far, as current radio surveys are hampered by computational limitations with
respect to the detection of very short spin period pulsars in short orbital
period binaries.

column obtained for the absorbed component is ~4.5 10^{22} cm^{-2}, an order of
magnitude larger than the Galactic absorption for this source, and the covering

sight is ~85^\circ, this model gives a reasonable scenario for the source: the
Comptonized spectrum could come from an extended accretion disk corona (ADC),
probably the only region that can be directly observed due to the high
inclination. The excess of matter producing the partial covering could be close
to the equatorial plane of the system, above the outer disk, occulting the
emission from the inner disk and the inner part of the ADC. An iron emission
line is also present at ~6.5 keV with an equivalent width of ~150 eV. We argue
that this strong iron line cannot be explained as reflection of the Comptonized
spectrum by the accretion disk. It is probably produced in the ADC. An emission
line at ~1.9 keV (with an equivalent width of ~54 eV) and an absorption edge at
\~8.7 keV (with an optical depth of ~0.1) are also required to fit this

boundaries, unlike the HTS materials. Thus, long polycrystalline MgB2
conductors may be easier to fabricate, and so could fill a potentially
important niche of applications in the 20 to 30 K temperature range. However,
one disadvantage of MgB2 is that in bulk material the critical current density,
Jc, appears to drop more rapidly with increasing magnetic field than it does in
the HTS phases. The magnitude and field dependence of Jc are related to the
presence of structural defects that can ""pin"" the quantised magnetic vortices
that permeate the material, and prevent them from moving under the action of
the Lorentz force. Vortex studies suggest that it is the paucity of suitable
defects in MgB2 that causes the rapid decay of Jc with field. Here we show that
modest levels of atomic disorder, induced by proton irradiation, enhance the
pinning, and so increase Jc significantly at high fields. We anticipate that
chemical doping or mechanical processing should be capable of generating
similar levels of disorder, and so achieve technologically-attractive
performance in MgB2 by economically-viable routes.

bursts that stand above the ``confusion'' GW noise made of many smaller
overlapping bursts. Even if only 10% of all string loops have cusps these
bursts might be detectable by the planned GW detectors LIGO/VIRGO and LISA for
string tensions as small as $G \mu \sim 10^{-13}$. In the implausible case
where the average cusp number per loop oscillation is extremely small, the
smaller bursts emitted by the ubiquitous kinks will be detectable by LISA for
string tensions as small as $G \mu \sim 10^{-12}$. We show that the strongly
non Gaussian nature of the stochastic GW's generated by strings modifies the
usual derivation of constraints on $G \mu$ from pulsar timing experiments. In
particular the usually considered ``rms GW background'' is, when $G \mu \gaq

includes rare, intense bursts. The consideration of the confusion GW noise
suggests that a Grand Unified Theory (GUT) value $ G \mu \sim 10^{-6}$ is

timing accuracy could detect the confusion noise coming from a network of cuspy

embedding. To make ekpyrotic scenario realistic one must solve the problem of
the negative cosmological constant on the visible brane and fine-tune the bulk
brane potential with an accuracy of $10^{-50}$. In terms of a canonically
normalized scalar field $\phi$ describing the position of the brane, this
potential must take a very unusual form $V(\phi)\sim e^{-{5000 \phi\over
M_p}}$. We describe the problems which appear when one attempts to obtain this
potential in string theory. The mechanism for the generation of density
perturbations in this scenario is not brane-specific; it is a particular
limiting case of the mechanism of tachyonic preheating. Unlike inflation, this
mechanism exponentially amplifies not only quantum fluctuations, but also
initial inhomogeneities. As a result, to solve the homogeneity problem in this
scenario, one would need the branes to be parallel to each other with an
accuracy better than $10^{-60}$ on a scale $10^{30}$ times greater than the
distance between the branes. Thus, at present, inflation remains the only
robust mechanism that produces density perturbations with a flat spectrum and
simultaneously solves all major cosmological problems.

briefly comment the properties of solitons and photons and recall some facts

(used in the partition of unity) we explicitly construct spatially finite screw

the notion for energy-momentum exchange between $F$ and $*F$, isintroduced and
used to compute the integral spin momentum of a screw soliton. The consistency
between the spatial and time periodicity naturally leads to a particular
relation between the longitudinal and transverse sizes of the screw solution,
namely, it is equal to $\pi$. The Planck's formula $E=h\nu$ in the form of
$ET=h$ arizes as a measure of the integral spin momentum.

experiences a higher speed of light as it gets hotter. We study the statistical
physics of this ""deformed radiation"", recovering standard results at low

Planck's spectrum, a temperature dependent equation of state $w=p/\rho$
(ranging from 1/3 to infinity), a new Stephan-Boltzmann law, and a new entropy
relation. These new photon properties closely mimic those of phonons in

H= {(k,0): k =< 0}.
  In a recent paper, G. Schaeffer and the author computed the length generating
function S(t) of walks on the slit plane for several sets S. All the generating
functions thus obtained turned out to be algebraic: for instance, on the
ordinary square lattice,
  S(t) =\frac{(1+\sqrt{1+4t})^{1/2}(1+\sqrt{1-4t})^{1/2}}{2(1-4t)^{3/4}}.
  The combinatorial reasons for this algebraicity remain obscure.
  In this paper, we present two new approaches for solving slit plane models.
One of them simplifies and extends the functional equation approach of the
original paper. The other one is inspired by an argument of Lawler; it is more
combinatorial, and explains the algebraicity of the product of three series
related to the model. It can also be seen as an extension of the classical
cycle lemma. Both methods work for any set of steps S.
  We exhibit a large family of sets S for which the generating function of
walks on the slit plane is algebraic, and another family for which it is
neither algebraic, nor even D-finite. These examples give a hint at where the
border between algebraicity and transcendence lies, and calls for a complete
classification of the sets S.

potentials, as well as discrete nonlinear Schroedinger (DNLS) chains
approximating the small-amplitude dynamics of KG chains with weak inter-site
coupling. The SWs are constructed as exact time-periodic multibreather
solutions from the anticontinuous limit of uncoupled oscillators. In the
validity regime of the DNLS approximation these solutions can be continued into
the linear phonon band, where they merge into standard harmonic SWs. For SWs
with incommensurate wave vectors, this continuation is associated with an
inverse transition by breaking of analyticity. When the DNLS approximation is
not valid, the continuation may be interrupted by bifurcations associated with
resonances with higher harmonics of the SW. Concerning the stability, we
identify one class of SWs which are always linearly stable close to the
anticontinuous limit. However, approaching the linear limit all SWs with
nontrivial wave vectors become unstable through oscillatory instabilities,
persisting for arbitrarily small amplitudes in infinite lattices. Investigating
the dynamics resulting from these instabilities, we find two qualitatively
different regimes for wave vectors smaller than or larger than pi/2,

to be limited by a maximum P_SN which depends on the CGLE coefficients;
MAW-like structures with period larger than P_SN evolve to defects. Second,
slowly evolving near-MAWs with average phase gradients $\nu \approx 0$ and
various periods occur naturally in phase chaotic states of the CGLE. As a
measure for these periods, we study the distributions of spacings p between
neighboring peaks of the phase gradient. A systematic comparison of p and P_SN
as a function of coefficients of the CGLE shows that defects are generated at
locations where p becomes larger than P_SN. In other words, MAWs with period
P_SN represent ``critical nuclei'' for the formation of defects in phase chaos
and may trigger the transition to defect chaos. Since rare events where p
becomes sufficiently large to lead to defect formation may only occur after a
long transient, the coefficients where the transition to defect chaos seems to
occur depend on system size and integration time. We conjecture that in the
regime where the maximum period P_SN has diverged, phase chaos persists in the
thermodynamic limit.

scattering in which the interplay between soft and hard processes and the

the spectra are enhanced at large $p_T$ (hard) by multiple scattering while
suppressed at low $p_T$ (soft) by absorptive correction with the transition
occurring at around a scale $p_0\sim 1-2$ GeV/$c$ that separates soft and hard
