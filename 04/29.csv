between the Galactic constants (R_0 and T_0), the stellar columndensity (S_*)
and the shape of the dark matter (DM) halo. Here we present analytical
relations that can be used to investigate the effects of the uncertain gaseous
velocity dispersion on the HI flaring constraints. The contribution of cosmic
rays and magnetic fields to the pressure gradients is small. A significantly
flattened dark matter halo is only possible if R_0 <~ 6.8 kpc.
  If R_0 is larger than ~7 kpc, or T_0 >~ 170 km/s, we can rule out two DM
candidates that require a highly flattened DM halo: 1) decaying massive
neutrinos; and 2) a disk of cold molecular hydrogen.
  It is only possible to construct self-consistent models of the Galaxy based
on the IAU-recommended values for the Galactic constants in the unlikely case
that the the stellar columndensity is smaller than ~18 M_sun/pc^2. If we assume
that the halo is oblate and S_* = 35 +/- 5 M_sun/pc^2, R_0 <~ 8 kpc and T_0 <~
200 km/s.
  Combining the best kinematical and star-count estimates of S_*, we conclude
that: 25 <~ S_* <~ 45 M_sun/pc^2. Kuijken & Gilmore's (1991) determination of
the columndensity of matter with |z|<=1.1 kpc is robust and valid over a wide
range of Galactic constants.
  Our mass models show that the DM density in the Galactic centre is uncertain
by a factor 1000. In the Solar neighbourhood we find: rho_DM ~0.42 GeV/c^2/cm^3
or (11 +/- 5) mM_sun/pc^3 -- roughly 15% of rho_tot.

high redshift represents one of our best opportunities to probe galaxy
formation and chemical evolution at early times. By coupling measurements made
in high z DLAs with our knowledge of abundances determined locally and with
nucleosynthetic models, we can start to piece together the star formation
histories of these galaxies. Here, we discuss the clues to galactic chemical
evolution that may be gleaned from studying the abundance of Co in DLAs. We
present high resolution echelle spectra of two QSOs, Q2206-199 and Q1223+17,
both already known to exhibit intervening damped systems. These observations
have resulted in the first ever detection of Co at high redshift, associated
with the z= 1.92 DLA in the sightline towards Q2206-199. We find that the
abundance of Co is approximately 1/4 solar and that there is a clear
overabundance relative to iron, [Co/Fe] = +0.31 +/- 0.05. From the abundance of
Zn, we determine that this is a relatively metal-rich DLA, with a metallicity
approximately 1/3 solar. Therefore, this first detection of Co is similar to
the marked overabundance relative to Fe seen in Galactic bulge and thick disk
stars.

anisotropy even along the in-plane directions is found. The amplitudes of the
spin signal allow the study of the spatial directions of the injected spin and
its precession axis. Surprisingly efficient dynamic nuclear polarization in a
geometry where the electron spins are injected almost transverse to the applied
magnetic field is attributed to an enhanced non-precessing electron spin
component. The small absolute value of the electron g-factor combined with
efficient nuclear spin polarization leads to large nuclear fields that dominate
electron spin precession at low temperatures. These effects allow for sensitive
detection of all-optical nuclear magnetic resonance induced by periodically
excited quantum-well electrons. The mechanism of previously observed Delta m =

"quant-ph/0104137","Cristopher Moore","Cristopher Moore and Alexander Russell","Quantum Walks on the Hypercube",,,,,"quant-ph",,"  Recently, it has been shown that one-dimensional quantum walks can mix more
quickly than classical random walks, suggesting that quantum Monte Carlo
algorithms can outperform their classical counterparts. We study two quantum
walks on the n-dimensional hypercube, one in discrete time and one in
continuous time. In both cases we show that the quantum walk mixes in (\pi/4)n
steps, faster than the O(n log n) steps required by the classical walk. In the
continuous-time case, the probability distribution is {\em exactly} uniform at
this time. More importantly, these walks expose several subtleties in the
definition of mixing time for quantum walks. Even though the continuous-time
walk has an O(n) instantaneous mixing time at which it is precisely uniform, it
never approaches the uniform distribution when the stopping time is chosen
randomly as in [AharonovAKV2001]. Our analysis treats interference between
terms of different phase more carefully than is necessary for the walk on the
cycle; previous general bounds predict an exponential, rather than linear,
mixing time for the hypercube.
