hypothesis (Parker 1988) that small scale dissipative events make the main
contribution to quiet Sun coronal heating. They also showed that these small
scale events are associated not only with the magnetic network, but also with
the cell interiors (Benz & Krucker, 1998). Taking into account in addition the
results of the analysis performed by Priest with co-authors (Priest et al.
2000) who demonstrated that the heating is quasi-homogeneous along the arcs we
come to the conclusion that the sources driving these dissipative events are
also small scale sources. Typically they are of the order of or smaller than
the linear scale of the events observed, that is smaller than 2000 km. To
describe statistical properties of quiet Sun corona heating by microflares,
nanoflares, and even smaller events, we consider a cellular automata model
subject to uniform small scale driving and dissipation. The model consists of
two elements, the magnetic field source supposed to be associated with the
small scale hydrodynamic turbulence convected from the photosphere and local
dissipation of small scale currents. The dissipation is assumed to be provided
by either anomalous resistivity, when the current density exceeds a certain
threshold value, or by the magnetic reconnection. The main problem considered
is how the statistical characteristics of dissipated energy flow depend upon
characteristics of the magnetic field source and on physical mechanism
responsible for the magnetic field dissipation. As the threshold value of
current is increased, we observe the transition from Gaussian statistics to
power-law type. In addition, we find that the dissipation provided by
reconnection results in stronger deviations from Gaussian distribution.

glassformers, hyperquenched water exhibits a large relaxation exotherm on

exotherm. However, when the relaxation exotherm for hyperquenched water is
scaled onto the plot for the bulk glassformers using the commonly accepted
glass transition temperature for water, 136K, its behavior appears completely
different. If we require that the behavior of water be comparable to the other

family of such inspirals (the inspiral of circular, inclined orbits) with an
eye toward understanding observable properties of the gravitational waves that
they generate. Using results previously presented to calculate the effects of
radiation reaction, I assemble the inspiral trajectories (assuming that
radiation reacts adiabatically, so that over short timescales the trajectory is
approximately geodesic) and calculate the wave generated as the compact body
spirals in. I do this analysis for several black hole spins, sampling a range
that should be indicative of what spins we will encounter in nature. The spin
has a very strong impact on the waveform. In particular, when the hole rotates
very rapidly, tidal coupling between the inspiraling body and the event horizon
has a very strong influence on the inspiral time scale, which in turn has a big
impact on the gravitational wave phasing. The gravitational waves themselves
are very usefully described as ``multi-voice chirps'': the wave is a sum of
``voices'', each corresponding to a different harmonic of the fundamental
orbital frequencies. Each voice has a rather simple phase evolution. Searching
for extreme mass ratio inspirals voice-by-voice may be more effective than
searching for the summed waveform all at once.

to be $ 0.8\times 10^{-3} < |a| < 2.24\times 10^{-3}$. b) Models with broken

the coupling and the $Z'$ mass are constrained, but $Z'$ mass can be large; And
c) The $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ is broken and the breaking scale is related to the
electroweak scale. In this case the $Z'$ mass is constrained to be $\sim 1.2$

next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM) is investigated, with
emphasis on the charged Higgs boson. The radiative corrections due to both
quarks and scalar-quarks of the third generation are taken into account, and
the negative result of the search for the Higgs bosons at CERN LEP2, with the
discovery limit of 0.1 pb, is imposed as a constraint. It is found that there
are parameter regions of the NMSSM where the lightest neutral Higgs boson may
even be massless, without being detected at LEP2. This implies that the LEP2
data do not contradict the existence of a massless neutral Higgs boson in the
NMSSM. For the charged Higgs boson, the radiative corrections to its mass may
be negative in some parameter regions of the NMSSM. The phenomenological lower
bound on the radiatively corrected mass of the charged Higgs boson is increased
as the CP violation becomes maximal, i.e., as the CP violating phase becomes
$\pi/2$. At the maximal CP violation, its lower bound is about 110 GeV for 5
$\leqslant \tan \beta \leqslant$ 40. The vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the
neutral Higgs singlet is shown to be no smaller than 16 GeV for any parameter
values of the NMSSM with explicit CP violation. This value of the lower limit
is found to increase up to about 45 GeV as the ratio ($\tan \beta$) of the VEVs
of the two Higgs doublets decreases to smaller values ($\sim$ 2). The discovery
limit of the Higgs boson search at LEP2 is found to cover about a half of the
kinematically allowed part of the whole parameter space of the NMSSM, and the
portion is roughly stable against the CP violating phase.

since the summer of 1999. The peak currents and luminosity steadily increased
through the end of the 2000 run on October 31. By that time, 0.75 A of
electrons (the design current) routinely collided with 1.4 A of positrons in
657 bunches, to give a peak luminosity of 2.6E33 cm^{-2} s^{-1}. We delivered
an integrated luminosity of up to 184/pb per day and 1033 per week; BABAR
logged a total of 25/fb. Three days of machine development at the end of the
run raised the peak luminosity to 3.29E33, exceeding the design goal of 3.0.
BABAR then logged data for an hour, starting with a peak of 3.20. Next, we
achieved the design value for positron current, 2.14 A, operating without
collisions. The major limitation has been growth in the size of the positron
beam in the low-energy ring (LER) due to electron clouds and multipacting.
Since the arcs benefit from antechambers and a TiN coating with low secondary
emission, our efforts have concentrated on the straights, where we added
solenoid windings. Each straight wound allowed higher LER current without
blow-up, and a consequent increase in luminosity. Measurements of the
bunch-by-bunch luminosity showed that the effect becomes significant by about
the tenth bunch in a train, but clears after a short gap. Careful control of
the fill pattern has thus been essential in raising luminosity. For the 2001
run, which began in February, we added a third LER RF station, to collide with
more LER current and more bunches, and also tried reducing beta_x* from 50 to
35 cm, with the goal of reaching a luminosity of 5E33 by year's end. In 2003,
we plan to add a fourth LER and sixth HER RF station to reach 1E34.

peak currents are obtained with the addition of a second bunch compressor in
the linac. In order to minimize the synchrotron radiation induced emittance
growth in the bunch compressor it is necessary to locate the new bunch
compressor at the low-energy end of the linac, just after the damping rings.
The bunch compressor is a duplicate of the LCLS chicane-style bunch compressor.
