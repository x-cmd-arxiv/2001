Combining the present data with those previously obtained by our group (1157
objects) we analyze the NIR properties of a nearly complete sample,
representative of galaxies of all morphological types, spanning 4 decades in
luminosity. We confirm our earlier claim that the presence of cusps and
extended haloes in the light profiles (C_31>5) is a strong, non-linear function
of the total luminosity. We also find that: i) among dEs and dS0s galaxies D
profiles are absent; 50% of the decompositions are of type M, the remaining
being of type E or T. ii) Less than 50% of the giant elliptical galaxies have
pure D profiles, the majority being represented by M profiles. iii) Most giant
galaxies (from elliptical to Sb) have M profiles. iv) Most of late type spirals
(Scd to BCD) have either E or T profiles. v) The type of decomposition is a
strong function of the total H band luminosity, independent of the Hubble
classification: the fraction of type E decompositions decreases with increasing
luminosity, while those of type M increase with luminosity. Pure D profiles are
absent in the low luminosity range L_H<10^10 solar and become dominant above
10^11 solar, while T profiles are present only among low luminosity galaxies.

these mass models with this technique. However, we find that, despite using the

lenses are fit equally well with several of the mass models. Each of the mass

efficient star formation in a clustered mode, whereas interstellar turbulence
that carries most energy on small scales results in isolated star formation
with low efficiency. The clump mass spectrum of shock-generated density
fluctuations in pure hydrodynamic, supersonic turbulence is not well fit by a
power law, and it is too steep at the high-mass end to be in agreement with the

collapse occurs, and the spectrum extends towards larger masses as clumps merge
together, a power-law description dN/dM ~ M^nu becomes possible with slope nu <

General relativistic effects are taken into account by using pseudo-Newtonian
potential of Pacz\'{y}nski, B., P. J. Witta (1980). When magnetic loops connect
the neutron star and the accretion disk, the twist injection from the disk or
from the rotating neutron star triggers expansion of the loops. Since the
expanding magnetic loops prevent inflow toward the magnetic poles of the
neutron star, disk matter accumulates on the boundary between the magnetosphere
and the disk. Magnetic reconnection taking place in the loops creates a channel
along which the disk matter can accrete and unloads the magnetosphere. This
process produces quasi-periodic variation of the accretion flow in the
innermost region of the disk. We found two kinds of oscillations. One is the
magnetospheric oscillation regulated by magnetic reconnection. The other is the
radial disk oscillation. The typical frequency of the oscillations is 100 Hz to
2 kHz. Furthermore, we predict that QPO sources inevitably accompany X-ray
flares by magnetic reconnection and bipolar outflows of hot X-ray emitting
plasma similar to the optical jets in protostars.

regime at the edge of a wide channel is studied in a self-consistent way by
using a generalized local density approximation proposed here. Both exchange
interaction and strong electron correlations, due to edge states, are taken
into account. They essentially modify the spatial behavior of the occupied
lowest spin-up LL in comparison with that of the lowest spin-down LL, which is
totally empty. The contrast in the spatial behavior can be attributed to a
different effective one-electron lateral confining potentials for the
spin-split LLs. Many-body effects on the spatially inhomogeneous spin-splitting
are calculated within the screened Hartree-Fock approximation. It is shown
that, far from the edges, the maximum activation energy is dominated by the gap
between the Fermi level and the bottom of the spin-down LL, because the gap
between the Fermi level and the spin-up LL is much larger. In other words, the
maximum activation energy in the bulk of the channel corresponds to a highly
asymmetric position of the Fermi level within the gap between spin-down and
spin-up LLs in the bulk. We have also studied the renormalization of the
edge-state group velocity due to electron correlations. The results of the
present theory are in line with those suggested and reported by experiments on

almost optimally doped Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8}. The c-axis conductivity of
this compound exhibits the same kind of anomalies as that of underdoped
YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-delta}. We analyze these anomalies in detail and show that
they can be explained within a model involving the intra-bilayer Josephson
effect and variations of the electric field inside the unit cell. The Josephson
coupling energies of different bilayer compounds obtained from the optical data
are compared with the condensation energies and it is shown that there is a
reasonable agreement between the values of the two quantities. We argue that
the Josephson coupling energy, as determined by the frequency of the
intra-bilayer Josephson plasmon, represents a reasonable estimate of the change
of the effective c-axis kinetic energy upon entering the superconducting state.
It is further explained that this is not the case for the estimate based on the
use of the simplest ``tight-binding'' sum rule. We discuss possible
interpretations of the remarkable agreement between the Josephson coupling
energies and the condensation energies. The most plausible interpretation is
that the interlayer tunneling of the Cooper pairs provides the dominant
contribution to the condensation energy of the bilayer compounds; in other

is independent of the contact form used to represent the given contact
structure. Removing the regularity and integrality assumptions and replacing
them with one concerning the existence of a slice, which is satisfied for
compact symmetry groups, results in a contact stratified space; i.e, a
stratified space equipped with a line bundle which, when restricted to each
stratum, defines a co-oriented contact structure. This extends the previous
work of the author and E. Lerman [LW].

  Representations: A Case Study of the Spike Process","39 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Annals of the Institute of
  Statistical Mathematics",,,,"math.NA math.ST q-bio stat.TH",,"  Finding a basis/coordinate system that can efficiently represent an input
data stream by viewing them as realizations of a stochastic process is of
tremendous importance in many fields including data compression and
computational neuroscience. Two popular measures of such efficiency of a basis
are sparsity (measured by the expected $\ell^p$ norm, $0 < p \leq 1$) and
statistical independence (measured by the mutual information). Gaining deeper
understanding of their intricate relationship, however, remains elusive.
Therefore, we chose to study a simple synthetic stochastic process called the
spike process, which puts a unit impulse at a random location in an
$n$-dimensional vector for each realization. For this process, we obtained the
following results: 1) The standard basis is the best both in terms of sparsity
and statistical independence if $n \geq 5$ and the search of basis is
restricted within all possible orthonormal bases in $R^n$; 2) If we extend our
basis search in all possible invertible linear transformations in $R^n$, then
the best basis in statistical independence differs from the one in sparsity; 3)
In either of the above, the best basis in statistical independence is not
unique, and there even exist those which make the inputs completely dense; 4)
There is no linear invertible transformation that achieves the true statistical
independence for $n > 2$.

exhibit zero growth, i.e. they behave like linear systems, while the remaining

the singularity confinement based on the requirement that every singularity,

steps. The second recently proposed is the algebraic entropy criterion
associated to the growth of the degree of the iterates. The algebraic entropy
results confirm the previous findings of singularity confinement on discrete
Painlev\'e equations. The degree-growth methods are also applied to
linearisable systems. The result is that systems integrable through
linearisation have a slower growth than systems integrable through isospectral
methods. This may provide a valuable detector of not just integrability but
also of the precise integration method. We propose an extension of the Gambier
mapping in $N$ dimensions. Finally a dual strategy for the investigation of the
integrability of discrete systems is proposed based on both singularity
confinement and the low growth requirement.
