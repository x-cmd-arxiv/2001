  Supplement","Astrophys.J.Suppl. 135 (2001) 227-262","10.1086/321798",,"astro-ph",,"  We present the results of an extension of the FIRST Bright Quasar Survey
(FBQS) to the South Galactic cap, and to a fainter optical magnitude limit.
Radio source counterparts with SERC R magnitudes brighter than 18.9 which meet
the other FBQS criteria are included. We supplement this list with a modest
number of additional objects to test our completeness for quasars with extended
radio morphologies. The survey covers 589 square degrees in two equatorial
strips in the southern cap. We have obtained spectra for 86% of the 522
candidates, and find 321 radio-selected quasars of which 264 are reported here
for the first time. A comparison of this fainter sample with the FBQS sample
shows the two to be generally similar.
  Fourteen new broad absorption line (BAL) quasars are included in this sample.
When combined with the previously identified BAL quasars in our earlier papers,
we can discern a break in the frequency of BAL quasars with radio loudness,
namely that the relative number of high-ionization BAL quasars drops by a
factor of four for quasars with a radio-loudness parameter R* > 100.

observational upper limits from Faraday rotation observations and X-ray

with existing instruments. We also show that high energy cosmic ray experiments
now under construction will be able to detect the level of anisotropy predicted

Two additionally significant features of these isochrones are that (1) the
stellar models start their evolution from the pre-main sequence birthline

has been performed using both the latest table of Lejeune et al., and the
older, but now modified, Green et al. table. The isochrones have performed well
under the tests conducted thus far. The reduction in the age of the Galactic
globular clusters caused by this update in stellar models alone is
approximately 15% relative to RYI-based studies. When the suggested
modification for the alpha-element enhancement is made as well, the total age
reduction becomes approximately 20%. When post-RGB evolutionary stages are
included, we find that the ages of globular clusters derived from integrated

transformations, are consistent with CSJ equilibrium temperatures within a
probable error of $\delta \log T_e = \pm 0.003$. As a consequence it is shown
that the pulsational temperature scale, temperature-period-blue amplitude

Further statistical studies indicate that the AGN fraction increases from

For the single nucleus category, there is a high luminosity tail in the

logN(Al+)-logN(Si+) and logN(Al+)-logN(Fe+) that we use to indirectly estimate
N(Al+) from N(Si+) and/or N(Fe+) measurements. In this way we determine the
ratio R(Al++/Al+) for a sample of 20 DLAs. Contrary to common belief, the ratio
can attain relatively high values (up to 0.6), suggesting that gas of
intermediate ionization state plays an important role in DLAs. On the other
hand, the lack of any trend between abundance ratios, such as Si/H and Si/Fe,
and R(Al++/Al+) indicates that abundances are not severely influenced by
ionization effects. We find a logR(Al++/Al+) - logN(H I) anticorrelation that
we use, in conjunction with idealized photoionization equilibrium calculations,
to constrain the ionization properties and to predict ionization corrections in
DLAs. We consider two possible origins for the species of low and intermediate
ionization state: (1) neutral regions devoid of Al++ and/or (2) partially
ionized, (Al++)-bearing regions. The logR(Al++/Al+) - logN(H I) anticorrelation
can be naturally explained in terms of a two-region model with a soft,
stellar-type ionizing radiation field. We present abundance ionization
corrections for 14 elements of astrophysical interest derived with different
types of ionizing spectra. For most of these elements the corrections are
generally below measurements errors, contrary to the predictions of recent

instability) might give rise to turbulence in a cylindric Couette flow is
investigated through numerical simulations. The study is linear and the fluid
flow is supposed to be incompressible and differentially rotating with a simple
velocity profile with $\Omega = a+b/R^2$. The simplicity of the model is
counterbalanced by the fact that the study is fully global in all three spatial
directions with boundaries on each side; finite diffusivities are also allowed.
The investigation is also carried out for several values of the azimuthal
wavenumber of the perturbations in order to analyse whether non-axisymmetric
modes might be preferred, which might produce, in a non-linear extension of the
study, a self-sustained magnetic field.
  We find that with magnetic field the instability is easier to be excited than
without magnetic field. The critical Reynolds number for Pm$=1$ is of order 50
independent of whether the nonmagnetic flow is stable or not. Also we find that
i) the magnetic field strongly reduces the number of Taylor vortices, ii) the
angular momentum is transported outwards and iii) for finite c ylinders a netto
dynamo-alpha effect results which is negative for the upper part of the
cylinder and which is positive for the lower part of the cylinder.
  For magnetic Prandtl number smaller than unity the critical Reynolds number
scales with Pm$^{-0.65}$. If this was true even for very small magnetic Prandtl
number (e.g. liquid sodium) the critical Reynolds number should reach the value
10$^5$ which is, however, also characteristic for nonlinear fi nite-amplitude
hydrodynamic Taylor-Couette turbulence -- so that we easily have to expect the
simultaneous existence of both sorts of instabi lities in cold accretion disks.

there should be strong absorption in the bandpass of the Far Ultraviolet

these simulations relies partly upon understanding the shock-web complex, for
it can give rise to distributions that confound interpretation in terms of the
standard model for radiative aging of radio galaxies. 3. The magnetic field
outside of the jet itself becomes very intermittent and filamentary in these

occupied by field strengths considerably diminished below the nominal jet
value. Thus population aging rates vary considerably from point to point.

Micron Galactic Survey star counts for the characteristic signatures of an
in-plane bar and ring. The star counts in the plane for 30 deg.>l>-30 deg. are
shown to be highly asymmetric with considerably more sources at positive than
at negative longitudes. At |b|\approx 1.5 deg., however, the counts are nearly
symmetric. Therefore, the asymmetry is not due to the disc, which is shown to
have an inner truncation, or to the bulge, so there has to be another major
component in the inner Galaxy that is causing the asymmetries. This component
provides up to 50% of the detected sources in the plane between the bulge and
l=27 deg. or l=-14 deg. This component is shown to be consistent with an
in-plane bar with a position angle of 40 deg. and half-length of 3.9 kpc.
However, there is also a major peak in the counts at l=-22 deg., which
coincides with the tangential point of the so-called 3 kpc arm. This is shown
to be most probably a ring or a pseudo-ring. The extinction in the plane is
also shown to be asymmetric with more extinction at negative than at positive
longitudes. For l<8 deg. the extinction is shown to be slightly tilted with
respect to b=0 deg. in the same manner as the HI disc. We conclude that the

strong anisotropy in electrical transport, reducing the effective hopping

temperatures. Close to the critical temperature of mode-coupling theory (MCT)
the correlators obey in the alpha-regime the time temperature superposition
principle (TTSP) and show a weak stretching. We determine the wave-vector
dependence of the stretching parameter and find that for F_d(q,t) it shows
oscillations which are in phase with the static structure factor. The
temperature dependence of the alpha- relaxation times tau shows a crossover
from an Arrhenius law at low temperatures to a weaker T-dependence at
intermediate and high temperatures. At the latter temperatures the T-dependence
is described well by a power law. We find that the exponent gamma of the power
law for tau are significantly larger than the one for the diffusion constant.
The q-dependence of the alpha-relaxation times for F_d(q,t) oscillates around
tau(q) for F_s(q,t) and is in phase with the structure factor. Due to the
strong vibrational component of the dynamics at short times the TTSP is not
valid in the beta- relaxation regime. We show, however, that in this time
window the shape of the curves is independent of the correlator and is given by
a functional form proposed by MCT. We find that the value of the von Schweidler
exponent and the value of gamma for finite q are compatible with the expression

intensities determine both avalanche and non-avalanche domains, as well as
mixed one. Being corresponded to the SOC regime, the last domain is crucial to

and of the Hall angle theta_H. We find that RH-1 is linear in temperature
between 300K and the pseudogap temperature T*, whereas cot(theta_H) displays a
perfect T2 temperature dependence between typically 300 and 100K. We observe
for all the samples that the temperature at which the temperature dependence of

which RH displays a peak. This characteristic temperature, found to lie between
Tc and T*, does not depend markedly on the doping level and defines a new

relate these findings to recent high frequency conductivity and Nernst effect

rotations in a three-dimensional space and demonstrates a set of algorithms for

its three components transform covariantly on change of coordinates. The
mapping from rotations to vectors is 1:1 apart from computation error. The
discontinuities of the representation require special handling but are not
problematic. The rotation matrix can be generated efficiently from the vector
without the use of transcendental functions, and vice-versa. The representation
is more efficient than Euler angles, has affinities with Hassenpflug's Argyris
angles and is very closely related to the quaternion representation. While the
quaternion representation avoids the discontinuities inherent in any
3-component representation, this problem is readily overcome. The present paper
gives efficient algorithms for computing the set of rotations which map a given
vector to another of the same length and the rotation which maps a given pair
of vectors to another pair of the same length and subtended angle.

our discussion, apart from a constraint submanifold, a field of permitted

principle unrelated to the constraint submanifold. An implicit differential
equation is associated to a non-holonomic problem using the Tulczyjew's
geometrical description of the Legendre transformation. The integrable part of
this implicit differential equation is extracted using an adapted version of
the integrability algorithm. Moreover, sufficient conditions are found that
guarantees the compatibility of the non-holonomic problem, i.e., that assures
that the integrability algorithm stops at first step, and moreover it implies
the existence of a vector field whose integral curves are the solutions to the
problem. In addition this vector field turns out to be a second order
differential equation. These compatibility conditions are shown to include as
particular cases many others obtained previously by other authors. Several

both Quillen's fundamental result on K-homotopy invariance of regular rings and
the stable version of the triviality of vector bundles on affine toric

  The conjecture is equivalent to the claim that the relevant admissible

supported by monomials not in a non-degenerate corner subcone of the underlying
polyhedral cone. We prove that one can in fact eliminate all lattice points in

description of intermittency in isotropic conditions. For flows in presence of
a substantial mean shear, the nature of intermittency changes since the process
of energy transfer is affected by the turbulent kinetic energy production
associated with the Reynolds stresses. In these conditions a new form of
refined similarity law has been found able to describe the increased level of
intermittency which characterizes shear dominated flows. Ideally a length scale
associated with the mean shear separates the two ranges, i.e. the classical
Kolmogorov-like inertial range, below, and the shear dominated range, above.
However, the data analyzed in previous papers correspond to conditions where
the two scaling regimes can only be observed individually.
  In the present letter we give evidence of the coexistence of the two regimes
and support the conjecture that the statistical properties of the dissipation
field are practically insensible to the mean shear. This allows for a
theoretical prediction of the scaling exponents of structure functions in the
shear dominated range based on the known intermittency corrections for
isotropic flows. The prediction is found to closely match the available
numerical and experimental data.

on the resolution of the projective Hilbert space, the preparation information
can be made arbitrarily precise and hence indefinitely larger than the
classical communication cost. Therefore, the classical communication is
insufficient to account for the transfer of preparation information, which is
then attributed to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen channel. Some fundamental
repercussions for relativistic quantum information processing are briefly
discussed.

single target item in an unsorted database, is modified so as to be capable of
searching for an arbitrary specified number of target items. If the number of
targets, nu_0, is a power of four, the new algorithm will with certainty find
one of the targets in a database of n items using
(1/2)(3(N/nu_0)^{log_base_4(3)}-1) \approx (1/2)(3(N/nu_0)^{0.7925}-1) oracle
calls, where N is the smallest power of four greater than or equal to n. If
nu_0 is not a power of four, the algorithm will, with a probability of at least
one-half, find one of the targets using no more than
(1/2)(9(N/nu)^{log_base_4(3)}-1) calls, where nu is the smallest power of four
greater than or equal to nu_0.

on a base of a density matrix of the system. As an example, entropy and
temperature are evaluated for coherent states of a harmonic oscillator and
quantum field described by the Klein--Gordon--Fock equation with a source term.
It is shown, in particular, that the temperature of the coherent oscillator in
a ground state coincides with the effective temperature of a harmonic
oscillator being in contact with a heat bath (Bloch formula) when the bath
temperature tends to zero. The Bekenstein--Hawking entropy of a black hole can
also be interpreted as an entropy of coherent states of a physical vacuum in
the vicinity of a horizon surface.

high level of common mode suppression (> 85 dB) and low electronic noise (730
electrons per pulse) provide a signal to noise ratio of 14 dB for the
measurement of the quantum noise of individual pulses. Measurements at
repetition rates up to 1 MHz are possible. As a test, quantum tomography of the
coherent state is performed and the Wigner function and the density matrix are
reconstructed with a 99.5% fidelity. The detection system can also be used for
ultrasensitive balanced detection in cw mode, e.g. for weak absorption
measurements.

$spins (qubits) in an external time-dependent magnetic field, and under the
conditions of non-selective excitation (when the amplitude of the magnetic
field is large). This model is known as a possible candidate for experimental
realization of quantum computation. We present the theory for finding
delocalization transition and show that for the interaction between nearest
qubits, the transition is very different from that to quantum chaos. We explain
this phenomena by showing that in the considered region of parameters our model
is close to an integrable one. According to a general opinion, the threshold
for the onset of quantum chaos due to the interqubit interaction decreases with
an increase of the number of qubits. Contrary to this expectation, for a
magnetic field with constant gradient we have found that chaos border does not
depend on the number of qubits. We give analytical estimates which explain this
effect, together with numerical data supporting our analysis. Random models
with long-range interactions are studied as well. In particular, we show that
in this case the delocalization and quantum chaos borders coincide.
