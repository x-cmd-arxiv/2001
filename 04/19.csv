interaction scenario between NGC 4449 and DDO 125, a close companion in
projected space. In a first step fast restricted N-body models are used to
confine a region in parameter space reproducing the main observational
features. In a second step a genetic algorithm is applied for a uniqueness test
of our preferred parameter set. We show that our genetic algorithm reliably
recovers orbital parameters, provided that the data are sufficiently accurate,
i.e. all the key features are included.
  In the third step the results of the restricted N-body models are compared
with self-consistent N-body simulations. In the case of NGC 4449, the
applicability of the simple restricted N-body calculations is demonstrated.
Additionally, it is shown that the HI gas can be modeled here by a purely
stellar dynamical approach.
  In a series of simulations, we demonstrate that the observed features of the
extended HI disc can be explained by a gravitational interaction between NGC
4449 and DDO 125. According to these calculations the closest approach between
both galaxies happened $\sim 4-6 \cdot 10^8$ yr ago at a minimum distance of
$\sim 25$ kpc on a parabolic or slightly elliptic orbit. In the case of an
encounter scenario, the dynamical mass of DDO 125 should not be smaller than
10% of NGC 4449's mass. Before the encounter, the observed HI gas was arranged
in a disc with a radius of 35-40 kpc around the center of NGC 4449. It had the
same orientation as the central ellipsoidal HI structure. The origin of this
disc is still unclear, but it might have been caused by a previous interaction.

spectral power $P$ of the VLBA source is intermediate between those of
Sagittarius A and Sagittarius A$^*$ in the Galactic Center. For the VLBA source
in NGC 4395, the constraints on $T_b$, $d$, and $P$ are consistent with an
origin from a black hole but exclude an origin from a compact starburst or a
supernova remnant like Cassiopeia A. Moreover, the spectral powers of NGC 4395
at 1.4 and 4.9 GHz appear to be too low and too constant to allow analogy with
SN 1988Z, a suggested prototype for models of compact supernova remnants. The
variable and warm X-ray absorber in NGC 4395 has a free-free optical depth much
larger than unity at 1.4 GHz and, therefore, cannot fully cover the VLBA

function of clusters shows no enhancement along the line of sight, due to the
lack of any virialised structures in the cluster distribution. However, the
distortion of the clustering pattern due to coherent bulk motions is clearly
visible. The distribution of cluster peculiar motions is well described by a
Gaussian, except in the extreme high velocity tails. The simulations produce a
small but significant number of clusters with large peculiar motions. The form
of the redshift space power spectrum is strongly influenced by errors in
measured cluster redshifts in extant surveys. When these errors are taken into
account, the model reproduces the power spectrum recovered from the simulation
to an accuracy of 15% or better over a decade in wavenumber. We compare our
analytic predictions with the power spectrum measured from t! he!
  APM cluster redshift survey. The cluster power spectrum constrains the
amplitude of density fluctuations, as measured by the linear rms variance in
spheres of radius 8 h^(-1) Mpc, denoted by sigma_8. When combined with the
constraints on sigma_8 and the density parameter Omega derived from the local
abundance of clusters, we find a best fitting cold dark matter model with
sigma_8~1.25 and Omega~0.2, for a power spectrum shape that matches that
measured for galaxies. However, for the best fitting value of Omega and given
the value of Hubble's constant from recent measurements, the assumed shape of
the power spectrum is incompatible with the most readily motivated predictions

obscuring starburst, in which the interstellar gas and dust associated with the

of the quasi-static model mostly used up to now, consistently yielding large
loops (L >= R*) and no evidence of sustained heating. Our hydrodynamic modeling
approach, however, shows that the size of the flaring regions must be much
smaller (L <=R*) and moreover this method shows in all cases evidence of
vigorous sustained heating during the flare decay, so that the decay of the
observed light curve actually reflects the temporal profile of the heating
rather than that of the free decay of the heated loop(s). The events on the
protostar YLW 15 have durations comparable to the stellar rotation period, so
that their limited size and their lack of self-eclipses give evidence of a
polar location on the star. This is in contrast with the recently advanced
hypothesis that these flares are due to long loops spanning the region between
the star and the accretion disk. In general, the present analysis shows that
flaring coronae on PMS stars have a structure similar to the coronae on older
active stars.

agreement and yield a spin temperature $T_s = 890 \pm 160$ K, far higher than
$T_s$ values measured in local spirals, but similar to values obtained in the
majority of DLAs ($T_s \ga 1000$ K).
  The high velocity resolution of the Arecibo spectra enables us to obtain
estimates of physical conditions in the absorbing clouds by fitting multiple
Gaussians to the absorption profile. The spectra are well fit by a
three-component model with two narrow and one wide components, with
temperatures ${T_{k_1}} = 308 \pm 24$ K, ${T_{k_2}} = 180 \pm 30$ K and
${T_{k_3}} = 7600 \pm 1250$ K, respectively. The last of these is in excellent
agreement with the expected temperatures for the WNM ($5000 - 8000$ K). The
mere fact that components are seen with lower temperatures than the estimated
$T_s$ implies that the absorber must have a multi-phase medium.
  We use the measured 21-cm optical depth and the above estimates of the
kinetic temperature to obtain the HI column density in the various components.
The total column density in the narrow components is found to be $\NHI (CNM)
\le 1.9 \pm 0.25 \times 10^{20}$ cm, while that in the wide component is $\NHI
(WNM) \ge 1.26 \pm 0.49 \times 10^{21}$ cm. Thus, the WNM contains at least 75%
of the total HI in the $z = 0.2212$ DLA, unlike our Galaxy, in which the CNM
and WNM have equitable contributions; this accounts for the difference in the
spin temperatures of the $z = 0.2212$ system and local spirals, suggesting that
the DLA is probably a dwarf or LSB type galaxy (abridged).

shift of the quasiparticle states caused by supercurrents outside the vortex
core, nor an assumed spatially uniform suppression of the coherence factors or
spectral gap due to the applied field, can account for the observed effect. In
contrast, suppressing the gap or the coherence factors in the vortex core to
zero is consistent with the data. We demonstrate that an even simpler
description of the data can be achieved by assuming that the resonance is not
supported within an effective radius xi_{eff} around each vortex, where
xi_{eff} is the sum of the superconducting and spin-spin correlation lengths.
We use this simple idea to predict the doping dependence of the field
suppression.

The boron EFG variations are found to be related to specific features of their
band structure and particularly to the M-B hybridization. The strong charge
anisotropy at the B site in MgB$_2$ is completely defined by the valence
electrons - a property which sets MgB$_2$ apart from other diborides. The boron
EFG in MgB$_2$ is weakly dependent of applied pressure: the B p electron
anisotropy increases with pressure, but it is partly compensated by the
increase of core charge assymetry. The concentration of holes in bonding
$\sigma$ bands is found to decrease slightly from 0.067 to 0.062 holes/B under
a pressure of 10 GPa. Despite a small decrease of N(E$_F$), the Hopfield
parameter increases with pressure and we believe that the main reason for the
reduction under pressure of the superconducting transition temperature, T$_c$,
is the strong pressure dependence of phonon frequencies, which is sufficient to
compensate the electronic effects.

First, the metal-insulator and magnetic transitions are separated each other

both transition interactions $U$ increase with increasing $t'$. Both
transitions do not contradict the first-order transitions for smaller $t'/t$

nonmagnetic insulator phase is stabilized between MI and AF transitions. The

alternating layers of triblock and diblock (...ABCcaABCca...). The NCS phase is
stable over a narrow region near phi_2=0.4. This region is widest near the

independently of the reheating temperature from the required baryon asymmetry.
It is extremely interesting that the obtained scale of the $U(1)_{B-L}$
breaking is well consistent with the one suggested from the seesaw mechanism to
explain the recent neutrino-oscillation experiments. We consider that the

the moving domain wall approach. But this is not established in the BDL

initial bulk matter. If one chooses a bulk energy density $\rho_B$ to account
for a mass $M$ of the AdSS$_5$ black hole and the static fifth dimension, a
CFT-radiation term with $\rho_{CFT} \sim M/a^{4}$ comes out from the bulk
matter without introducing a localized matter distribution on the brane. This

potential and the strength of the hydrogen bonds between the film molecule and
the water are changed. Such changes increase the probability of soliton
creation. The model presented allows proton conductivity data in Langmuir films
to be explained.

theorem, a quantum analogue of de Finetti's classical theorem on exchangeable

Moody [Z. Wahrschein. verw. Geb. 33, 343 (1976)], which relies on advanced
mathematics and does not share the same potential for generalization. The
classical de Finetti theorem provides an operational definition of the concept
of an unknown probability in Bayesian probability theory, where probabilities
are taken to be degrees of belief instead of objective states of nature. The
quantum de Finetti theorem, in a closely analogous fashion, deals with
exchangeable density-operator assignments and provides an operational
definition of the concept of an ``unknown quantum state'' in quantum-state
tomography. This result is especially important for information-based
interpretations of quantum mechanics, where quantum states, like probabilities,
are taken to be states of knowledge rather than states of nature. We further
demonstrate that the theorem fails for real Hilbert spaces and discuss the
significance of this point.

fiber-optic arrangement provides stable, efficient and high-contrast routing of
the photons. The low bit error rate leads to high error correction efficiency
and minimizes data sacrifice during privacy amplification. Characterization
measurements made on a number of commercial avalanche photodiodes are presented
that highlight the need for improved devices tailored specifically for quantum
information applications. A scheme for frequency shifting the photons returning
from Alice's station to allow them to be distinguished from backscattered noise
photons is also described.

based on joint Bell-state measurements is worked out. When the entangled
coherent state is embedded in vacuum environment, its entanglement is degraded
but not totally lost. It is found that the larger the initial coherent
amplitude, the faster entanglement decreases. We investigate a scheme to
teleport a coherent superposition state while considering a mixed quantum
channel. We find that the decohered entangled coherent state may be useless for
quantum teleportation as it gives the optimal fidelity of teleportation less
than the classical limit 2/3.
