cosmic ray flux. In acceleration models (bottom-up models), they are produced
as secondaries of the possible interactions of the accelerated charged

discovered in a repeat observation by the HST of the HDF-), and serendipitously
monitored with NICMOS on HST throughout the GTO campaign. The SN type can be
determined from the host galaxy type:an evolved, red elliptical lacking enough
recent star formation to provide a significant population of core-collapse SNe.
The class- ification is further supported by diagnostics available from the
observed colors and temporal behavior of the SN, both of which match a typical
SN Ia. The photo- metric record of the SN includes a dozen flux measurements in
the I, J, and H bands spanning 35 days in the observed frame. The redshift
derived from the SN photometry, z=1.7+/-0.1, is in excellent agreement with the
redshift estimate of z=1.65+/-0.15 derived from the
U_300,B_450,V_606,I_814,J_110,J_125,H_160, H_165,K_s photometry of the galaxy.
Optical and near-infrared spectra of the host provide a very tentative
spectroscopic redshift of 1.755. Fits to observations of the SN provide
constraints for the redshift-distance relation of SNe~Ia and a powerful test of
the current accelerating Universe hypothesis. The apparent SN brightness is
consistent with that expected in the decelerating phase of the preferred
cosmological model, Omega_M~1/3, Omega_Lambda~2/3. It is inconsistent with grey
dust or simple luminosity evolution, candidate astro- physical effects which
could mimic past evidence for an accelerating Universe from SNe Ia at z~0.5.We
consider several sources of possible systematic error including lensing, SN
misclassification, selection bias, and calibration errors. Currently, none of
these effects appears likely to challenge our conclusions.

but not Fe. The H-yields calculated from data on other ultra-metal-poor stars
and the sun provide a template for quantitatively predicting the abundances of
all other r-elements. In CS 31082-001 these should show a significant
deficiency at A<135 relative to the solar r-pattern. It is proposed that CS
31082-001 should have had a companion that exploded as an SNII H event. If the
binary survived the explosion, this star should now have a compact companion,
most likely a stellar-mass black hole. Comparison of abundance data with

stringent test of the proposed r-process model. The U-Th age determined by
Cayrel et al. for CS 31082-001 is, to within substantial uncertainties, in
accord with the r-process age determined from solar system data. The time gap

chronometers to provide a lower limit on the age of the universe.

by (1) discovering a second 21cm absorption feature, corresponding to
absorption against the NE lobe of the background radio source and (2) spatially
``resolving'' the two absorption features to isolate the absorption along the
two lines of sight to the opposing radio lobes. These findings resolve the
disagreement in redshift between the UV metal and 21cm lines, and as well as
demonstrating that the neutral layer does absorb both lobes of the background
radio source. Simple kinematic models with an inclined, rotating gas disk match
the observed 21cm profile and are also compatible with both the redshift and
velocity spread of the absorption measured in UV resonance lines along a third,
independent line of sight to the quasar nucleus and with the lack of 21cm
absorption in as earlier VLBI experiment that was sensitive to opacity against
the hot spot in the northern lobe. The inferred rotation speed and luminosity
for the galaxy are compatible with the z approximately 0 Tully-Fisher Relation.

radio sources is a powerful tool in determining the nature of the damped

degraded to the resolution that they would have had if they were all located at

shifts in rest wavelength were mitigated by using R-band images for the
classification of galaxies with 0.2 < z < 0.6 and I-band images for objects
with redshifts 0.6 < z < 1.1. A special effort was made to search for bars in
distant galaxies. The present data strongly confirm the previous conclusion
that the Hubble tuning fork diagram only provides a satisfactory framework for
the classification of galaxies with z ~< 0.3. More distant disk galaxies are
often difficult to shoehorn into the Hubble classification scheme. The paucity
of barred spirals and of grand-design spirals at large redshifts is confirmed.
It is concluded that the morphology of disk galaxies observed at look-back
times smaller than 3--4 Gyr differs systematically from that of more distant
galaxies viewed at look-back times of 4--8 Gyr. The disks of late-type spirals
at z >0.5 are seen to be more chaotic than those of their nearer counterparts.
Furthermore the spiral structure in distant early-type spirals appears to be
less well-developed than it is in nearby early-galaxies.

the contrary, we find that the classical galactic-wind model is problematic to
apply to the low-mass dSphs, whose low binding energy is comparable to that
released by several supernova explosions. A strongly regulated star formation
in their formation phase is required to reproduce their observed metallicity.
Such regulation is naturally expected in a gas cloud with the primordial
elemental abundance according to Nishi & Tashiro. A significant scatter in the

vertex is added; then, with probability delta, two vertices are chosen
uniformly at random and joined by an undirected edge. This process is repeated
for t time steps. In the limit of large t, the resulting graph displays
surprisingly rich characteristics. In particular, a giant component emerges in
an infinite-order phase transition at delta = 1/8. At the transition, the
average component size jumps discontinuously but remains finite. In contrast, a
static random graph with the same degree distribution exhibits a second-order
phase transition at delta = 1/4, and the average component size diverges there.
These dramatic differences between grown and static random graphs stem from a
positive correlation between the degrees of connected vertices in the grown
graph--older vertices tend to have higher degree, and to link with other
high-degree vertices, merely by virtue of their age. We conclude that grown
graphs, however randomly they are constructed, are fundamentally different from
their static random graph counterparts.

intent of modeling experiments involving energy transfer due to dipole-dipole
interactions between ultracold Rydberg atoms, and the subsequent propagation of
dipolar excitons. However, the results and the techniques developed to obtain
them are more generally applicable to a wide variety of problems.
  We start by studying a simplified model that considers only the energy
transfer process in an infinite medium of randomly distributed atoms. This
model is very instructive, because it gives a simplified arena in which to
develop the techniques that are used again and again throughout the thesis.
Exact analytical results are obtained for the time evolution of energy
transfer, its dependence on the detuning from resonance, and the localization
distance over which the transfer process is effective. The result for the
initial rate of energy transfer turns out to have general validity. This
soluble model also provides an excellent means for testing the numerical
simulations that are carried out for a finite sample.
  When we allow for the propagation of dipolar excitons, it is no longer
possible to obtain exact analytical solutions, but an approximation has been
found that agrees quite well with the numerical simulations for the amplitude
of the overall process. Simulations are necessary to find the sample-averaged
probability...

the fast, outgoing partons and target spectators, which is usually assumed to
be an irrelevant gauge artifact, affects the leading twist structure functions
in a profound way. This observation removes the apparent contradiction between
the projectile (eikonal) and target (parton model) views of diffractive and
small x_{Bjorken} phenomena. The diffractive scattering of the fast outgoing
quarks on spectators in the target causes shadowing in the DIS cross section.
Thus the depletion of the nuclear structure functions is not intrinsic to the
wave function of the nucleus, but is a coherent effect arising from the
destructive interference of diffractive channels induced by final state
interactions. This is consistent with the Glauber-Gribov interpretation of
shadowing as a rescattering effect.

its ability to obtain the other possible solar solutions. It is found that all
four viable solar neutrino oscillation solutions can be achieved in the model
simply by modification of the right-handed Majorana neutrino mass matrix, M_R.
Whereas the small mixing and vacuum solutions are easily obtained with several
texture zeros in M_R, the currently-favored large mixing angle solution
requires a nearly geometric hierarchical form for M_R that leads by the seesaw
formula to a light neutrino mass matrix which has two or three texture zeros.
The form of the matrix which provides the ``fine-tuning'' necessary to achieve
the large mixing angle solution can be understood in terms of Froggatt-Nielsen
diagrams for the Dirac and right-handed Majorana neutrino mass matrices. The
solution fulfils several leptogenesis requirements which in turn can be
responsible for the baryon asymmetry in the universe.

correctly treat the severe infrared singularities which inevitably appear in

soften structure formation at galactic scales and raises the possibility that
much of the dark matter of the universe is conformal matter. Finally, the

to 1.2 GeV is presented within a chiral constituent quark model. A model
embodying all known nucleonic resonances shows clear need for a yet
undiscovered third S11 resonance in the second resonance region, for which we
determine the mass (1.729 GeV) and the total width (183 MeV). Furthermore, we
extract the configuration mixing angles, an important property of the
quark-quark interaction in the quark model, for the resonances S11(1535) and
S11(1650), as well as for the resonances D13(1520) and D13(1700). Our results
agree well with the quark model predictions. In addition, the partial eta N
decay widths and/or the photo-excitation helicity amplitudes for the nucleonic
resonances S11(1535), S11(1650), P11(1710), P13(1720), D13(1520), D13(1700),
D15(1675), and F15(1680) are also obtained in this approach.

the beam density and current velocity. The linearized one dimensional equations
have been analysed, and explicit expressions for the coherent beam-beam

basis is developed for nonadditive information theory. The classical
nonadditive conditional entropy indexed by the positive parameter q is
introduced and then translated into quantum information. This quantity is
nonnegative for classically correlated states but can take negative values for
entangled mixed states. This property is used to study quantum entanglement in
the parametrized Werner-Popescu-like state of an N^n-system, that is, an
n-partite N-level system. It is shown how the strongest limitation on validity
of local realism (i.e., separability of the state) can be obtained in a novel
manner.
