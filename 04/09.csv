most relativistic objects known so far. GRBs occur when an ultrarelativisitic
ejecta is slowed down by internal shocks within the flow. Relativistic
particles accelerated within these shocks emit the observed gamma-rays by a
combination of synchrotron and inverse Compton emission. External shocks with
the circumstellar matter slow down further the ejecta and produce the
afterglow, which lasts for months. Comparison of the predictions of this
fireball model with observations confirm a relativistic macroscopic motion with
a Lorentz factor of $\Gamma \ge 100$. Breaks in the light curves of the
afterglow indicate that GRBs are beamed with typical opening angles of a few
degrees. The temporal variability of the gamma-rays signal provide us with the
best indirect evidence on the nature of the ``internal engine'' that powers the
GRBs and accelerates the relativistic ejecta, suggesting accretion of a massive
disk onto a newborn black hole: GRBs are the birth cries of these black holes.
Two of the most promising models: Neutron Star Mergers and Collapars lead
naturally to this scenario.

band filters centred on the resonance lines of neutral K and Na, and in a Str.
b filter (only U Ant). They confirm results obtained in CO radio line
observations, but also reveal new and interesting structures. Towards R Scl the
scattering appears optically thick in both the K and Na filters, and both
images outline almost perfectly circular disks with essentially uniform
intensity out to a sharp outer radius of 21"". These disks are larger -- by
about a factor of two -- than the radius of the detached shell which has been
marginally resolved in CO radio line data. In U Ant the scattering in the K
filter appears to be, at least partially, optically thin, and the image is
consistent with scattering in a geometrically thin (3"") shell (radius 43"") with
an overall spherical symmetry. The size of this shell agrees very well with
that of the detached shell seen in CO radio line emission. The scattering in
the Na filter appears more optically thick, and the image suggests the presence
of at least one, possibly two, shells inside the 43"" shell. There is no
evidence for such a multiple-shell structure in the CO data, but this can be
due to considerably lower masses for these inner shells. Weak scattering
appears also in a shell which is located outside the 43"" shell. The present
data do not allow us to conclusively identify the scattering agent, but we
argue that most of the emission in the K and Na filter images is to due to
resonance line scattering, and that there is also a weaker contribution from
dust scattering in the U Ant data. Awaiting new observational data, our
interpretation must be regarded as tentative.

conditions (exciting radiation fields with effective temperature, Teff, ranging
from 23,000 to 45,000 K). The SWS spectra are decomposed coherently in our
sample into Lorentz profiles and a broadband continuum. We find that the
individual profiles of the main AIBs at 3.3, 6.2, 8.6 and 11.3 microns are well
represented with at most two lorentzians. Furthermore, we show that the
positions and widths of these AIBs are remarkably stable (within a few cm-1).
We then extract the profiles of individual AIBs from the data and compare them
to a model of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) cation emission which
includes the temperature dependence of the AIB profiles. The present similarity
of the AIB profiles requires that the PAH temperature distribution remains
roughly the same whatever the radiation field hardness. Deriving the
temperature distribution of interstellar PAHs, we show that its hot tail, which
controls the AIB spectrum, sensitively depends on Nmin (the number of C-atoms
in the smallest PAH) and Teff. Comparing the observed profiles of the
individual AIBs to our model results, we can match most of the AIB profiles if
Nmin is increased with Teff. We then discuss our results in the broader context

be in neutral form.

indicate an enhanced abundance of small dust grains within the PDR. A spatial
correlation between the gas cooling lines and the infrared emission from small

Gaussian and/or Lorentzian profiles. In most cases, the broad Balmer components
are well fitted by a single Lorentzian profile. This has consequences
concerning their FWHMs and line ratios: when the broad Balmer components are
fitted with a Lorentzian, most narrow line regions have line ratios typical of
Seyfert 2s while, when a Gaussian profile isused for fitting the broad Balmer
components, the line ratios are widely scattered in the usual diagnostic

previously suggested, there is a continuous transition of all properties
between NLS1s and classical Broad-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies (BLS1s) and the limit

originally proposed by Lifshitz, Grosberg and Khokhlov in three dimensions and
recently given new impetus by its use in the description of simulational
results for four-dimensional interacting self-avoiding walks (ISAW). In fact,
we argue that the available data is consistent with the conclusion that the
collapse transitions of ISAT and ISAW lie in the same universality class, in
contradiction with long-standing predictions. We deduce that there exists a
pseudo-first order transition for ISAT in four dimensions at finite lengths
while the thermodynamic limit is described by the standard polymer mean-field
theory (giving a second-order transition), in contradiction to the prediction
that the upper critical dimension for ISAT is $d_u=4$.

on the order of ten to the twelfth to ten to the thirteenth G. A previously
predicted electromagnetic time dilation effect has been shown to correctly
predict decay lifetimes of muons bound to atomic nuclei. In this paper it is
shown that the electromagnetic time dilation effect, along with the
gravitational time dilation effect, can produce total neutron star redshifts
that are substantially larger than 0.62. For instance, the redshift can cutoff
radiation for B on the order of ten to the thirteenth G. Consequently, we can
have a neutron star that is unobservable except for localized surface regions
where the cutoff condition does not hold. Assuming coherent radiation, a
surface region of this kind that does not include the star's rotation axis will
emit a lighthouse type beam. Since the magnetic field in these regions will
usually be strong enough to cause significant redshifts, and there is no reason
to expect these regions to always be of constant size, shape, or field
strength, this model explains the predominance of radio waves, and the
existence of pulse variations, (e.g. nulling and drifting) in pulsars.

The information needed to compute expectation values of local observables can
be collected in a quantum mechanical state vector, whereas further statistical
information about the probability distribution outside the local region becomes
irrelevant. The translation of the available information between neighboring
local regions is expressed by a Hamilton operator. A quantum mechanical
operator can be associated to each local observable, such that expectation
values of ``classical'' observables can be computed by the usual quantum
mechanical rules. The requirement that correlation functions should respect
equivalence relations for local obeservables induces a non-commutative product
in classical statistics, in complete correspondence to the quantum mechanical
operator product. We also discuss the issue of interference and the complex

short computation shows that the meet (\cap) and join (\cup) are resolved in a
projection operator representation with the aid of one additional product
beyond the standard Geometric Algebra products. The result is that the join can
be computed even when the subspaces have a common factor, and the meet can be
computed without knowing the join. All of the operations can be defined and
computed in any signature (including degenerate signatures) by transforming the
problem to an analogous problem in a different algebra through a transformation
induced by a linear invertible function (a LIFT to a different algebra). The
new results, as well as the techniques by which we reach them, add to the tools

this result we prove that the N MNSE-soliton train interaction (N>2) can be
modeled by the completely integrable complex Toda chain (CTC). This is an
argument in favor of universality of the complex Toda chain which was
previously shown to model the soliton train interaction for nonlinear
Schrodinger solitons. The integrability of the CTC is used to describe all
possible dynamical regimes of the N-soliton trains which include asymptotically
free propagation of all N solitons, N-soliton bound states, various mixed
regimes, etc. It allows also to describe analytically the manifolds in the
4N-dimensional space of initial soliton parameters which are responsible for
each of the regimes mentioned above. We compare the results of the CTC model
with the numerical solutions of the MNSE for 2 and 3-soliton interactions and
find a very good agreement.

recently become possible with the development of clear, large homogeneous and
hydrophobic aerogel. A lightweight mirror was constructed using a newly

show that squashed light does not mimic all aspects of squeezed light, and in

of a classical variable is influenced significantly by an earlier state of a

equilibrium systems, provided the classical motion is chaotic. This paper deals
with this classical aspect of quantum measurement, assuming that the Heisenberg
