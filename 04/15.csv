Galaxy, where the most detailed information is attainable, is the convolution

into the present Galactic potential well. There is direct evidence that this
assembly continues today, with both stars and gas being assembled into, or at
least rearranged in, the Galactic potential. But is this recent accretion
significant? Was the last significant accretion the formation of the thick
disk, some 10Gyr ago?. Recent spectroscopic studies support this unexpected
result, while dynamical studies find increasing numbers of specific examples of
smaller scale more recent accretion. We present early results for one specific

likely that a large range of shock velocities may exist at a spatial scale
smaller than we are able to resolve. By comparing CIV 1550, CIII 977 and CIII]

significant column depth is present at all positions, including those not near
bright optical/UV filaments. Analysis of the OVI doublet ratio suggests an
average optical depth of about unity in that ion while flux measurements of

the brightness of the OVI emission and the age of the interaction, we rule out
the mixing layer interpretation of the UV emission. Furthermore, we formulate a

only if a sequence of invariants vanish. The first of these, which was earlier
identified by Fels, determines if the differential equation is variational. The
next two determine if there is a well-defined metric on $M$ and if the given
paths are its geodesics.

  pp13-28",,,"math.RA math.KT",,"  Almkvist proved that for a commutative ring A the characteristic polynomial
of an endomorphism \alpha:P \to P of a finitely generated projective A-module
determines (P,\alpha) up to extensions. For a non-commutative ring A the
generalized characteristic polynomial of an endomophism \alpha : P \to P of a
finitely generated projective A-module is defined to be the Whitehead torsion
[1-x\alpha] \in K_1(A[[x]]), which is an equivalence class of formal power
series with constant coefficient 1.
  In this paper an example is given of a non-commutative ring A and an
endomorphism \alpha:P \to P for which the generalized characteristic polynomial
does not determine (P,\alpha) up to extensions. The phenomenon is traced back
to the non-injectivity of the natural map \Sigma^{-1}A[x] \to A[[x]], where
\Sigma^{-1}A[x] is the Cohn localization of A[x] inverting the set \Sigma of
matrices in A[x] sent to an invertible matrix by A[x] \to A; x \mapsto 0.

invention of the laser and the strong interactions realized in cavity QED
experiments. Photon antibunching advocating the discrete (particles), is
contrasted with amplitude squeezing which speaks of the continuous (waves). The
tension between particles and waves is demonstrated by a recent experiment
which combines the measurement strategies used to observe these nonclassical
behaviors of light [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 3149 (2000)].

degrees of freedom using the Monte Carlo Wave Function method. Instead of
dealing with a density matrix which can be very high-dimensional, the method
consists of integrating a stochastic Schrodinger equation with a non-hermitian
damping term in the evolution operator, and with random quantum jumps. The
method is applied to the diffusion of hydrogen on the Ni(111) surface below 100
K. We show that the recent experimental diffusion data for this system can be
understood through an interband activation process, followed by quantum
tunnelling.
