map. The estimator has been widely used in astronomy, owing to its low level of
noise; it involves a weight function -- or smoothing kernel -- w(\theta). We
show that this estimator is not unbiased, in the sense that the expectation
value of the smoothed map is not the underlying process convolved with $w$, but
a convolution with a modified kernel w_eff(\theta). We show how to calculate
w_eff for a given kernel w and investigate its properties. In particular, it is
found that (1) w_eff is normalized, (2) has a shape `similar' to the original
kernel w, (3) converges to w in the limit of high number density of data
points, and (4) reduces to a top-hat filter in the limit of very small number
density of data points. Hence, although the estimator is biased, the bias is
well understood analytically, and since w_eff has all the desired properties of
a smoothing kernel, the estimator is in fact very useful. We present explicit
examples for several filter functions which are commonly used, and provide a
series expression valid in the limit of large density of data points.

we have imaged a luminous young star cluster in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC
6946. The cluster has an absolute visual magnitude M(V)=-13.2, comparable to
the brightest young `super-star clusters' in the Antennae merger galaxy. UBV
colors indicate an age of about 15 Myr. The cluster has a compact core (core
radius = 1.3 pc), surrounded by an extended envelope. We estimate that the
effective radius (Reff) = 13 pc, but this number is uncertain because the outer
parts of the cluster profile gradually merge with the general field. Combined
with population synthesis models, the luminosity and age of the cluster imply a
mass of 8.2x10^5 Msun for a Salpeter IMF extending down to 0.1 Msun, or
5.5x10^5 Msun if the IMF is log-normal below 0.4 Msun. Depending on model
assumptions, the central density of the cluster is between 5300 Msun pc^-3 and
17000 Msun pc^-3, comparable to other high-density star forming regions. We
also estimate a dynamical mass for the cluster, using high-dispersion spectra
from the HIRES spectrograph on the Keck I telescope. The velocity dispersion is
10.0 +/- 2.7 km/s, implying a total cluster mass within 65 pc of (1.7 +/- 0.9)
x 10^6 Msun. Comparing the dynamical mass with the mass estimates based on the
photometry and population synthesis models, the mass-to-light ratio is at least
as high as for a Salpeter IMF extending down to 0.1 Msun, although a turn-over
in the IMF at 0.4 Msun is still possible within the errors. The cluster will
presumably remain bound, evolving into a globular cluster-like object.
