et al. (1993) and Marzke et al. (1995). I show that while the SCDM model
disagrees with the observed values, as pointed out by several authors (Peebles
1976, 1980; Davis & Peebles 1983; Mo et. al 1993; Jing et al. 1998), taking
account of non-radial motions produce smaller values for the PVD. At r <=1
h^{-1} Mpc the result is in agreement with Bartlett & Blanchard (1996)
(hereafter BB96). At the light of this last paper, the result may be also read
as a strong dependence of the CVT prediction on the model chosen to describe
the mass distribution around galaxies, suggesting that the CVT cannot be taken
as a direct evidence of a low density universe. Similarly to what shown in Del
Popolo & Gambera (1999, 2000) (hereafter DG99, DG00), Del Popolo et al. (1999),
the agreement of our model to the observational data is due to a scale
dependent bias induced by the presence of non-radial motions. Since the
assumptions on which CVT is based have been questioned by several authors
(BB96; SJ97), I also calculated the PVD using the redshift distortion in the
redshift-space correlation function, \xi_z(r_p,\pi), and I compared it with the
PVD measured from the Las Campanas Redshift Survey by J98. The result confirms
that non-radial motions influence the PVD making them better agree with

OB associations that still contain O3 stars, suggesting that the HII regions

that wind-blown bubbles in these HII regions can be detected kinematically but
not morphologically because their expansion velocities are comparable to or
only slightly higher than the isothermal sound velocity in the HII regions.
Bubbles are detected around concentrations of massive stars, individual O
stars, and even an evolved red supergiant (a fossil bubble). Comparisons

discrepancy (1--2 orders of magnitude) between the stellar wind luminosity
derived from bubble observations and models and that derived from observations

obtained, divided in two data sets of 3.4 and 3.2 ksec which were separated by
2.6 ksec. The 5 Hz QPO was only present during the second data set. The QPO
increased in strength from below 2% rms amplitude for photon energies below 4
keV to ~5% rms amplitude for energies above 10 keV. The soft QPO photons (below
5 keV) lagged the hard ones (above 10 keV) by almost 1.5 radian. Besides the
QPO fundamental, its first overtone was detected. The strength of the overtone
increased with photon energy (from <2% rms below 5 keV to ~8% rms above 10

determination of the lags of the first overtone, indications are that also for
this QPO the soft photons lagged the hard ones. When the 5 Hz QPO was not
detected (i.e., during the first part of the observation), a broad noise
component was found for photon energies below 10 keV but it became almost a
true QPO (with a Q value of ~1.9) above that energy, with a frequency of ~3 Hz.
Its hard photons preceded the soft ones in a way reminiscent of the 5 Hz QPO,
strongly suggesting that both features are physically related. We discuss our

this would imply the presence of warm (T\sim 10^6 K) gas in these clusters with
a mass comparable to that of gas at coronal temperatures. If true, this would
have profound implications for our understanding of galaxy clusters and the
distribution of baryons in the universe. Here we show that because of the large
ionizing photon emissivities of gas at such low temperatures, the ionizing
photon fluxes seen by disk galaxies in the observed clusters can be very large,
resulting in minimum emission measures from neutral gas in such disks as high
as 100 cm^(-6) pc. This result is essentially independent of the mechanism
actually responsible for producing the alleged EUV excesses. The predicted
emission measures in Abell 1795 (z=0.063) are about an order of magnitude
larger than seen in the Reynolds layer of the Galaxy, providing a
straightforward observational test of the reality of the EUV excess. New
tunable filter H alpha images and WFPC images from the Hubble Space Telescope

the visual luminosity-to-mass ratio is a factor of 5 higher than that predicted

disc cavity while the disc interaction indices inward migration. When the
migration is slow enough, the more rapidly migrating outer protoplanet
approaches and becomes locked in a 2:1 commensurability with the inner one.
This is maintained in subsequent evolution. We study this evolution using a
simple anaytic model, full hydrodynamic 2D simulations of the disc planet
system and longer time N body integrations incorporating simple prescriptions
for the effect of the disc on the planet orbits. The eccentricity of the
protoplanets are found to be determined by the migration rate induced in the
outer planet orbit by the external disc. We apply our results to the recently
discovered resonant planets around GJ876. Simulation shows that a disc with

commensurability when the planets orbit in an inner cavity and that
eccentricities in the observed range may be obtained.

hardly affect the position and linewidth of the single line resonance, in spite
of the moment formation due to the broken chains. In contrast to Si, Zn and
Mg-doping, the presence of Ni (S = 1) at low concentration induces a
spectacular shift towards high fields of the ESR line (up to 40% for x=0.002),
together with a large broadening. This shift is strictly proportional to the
ratio of Ni to Cu susceptibilities: Hence it is strongly enhanced below the
spin-Peierls transition. We interpret this shift and the broadening as due to
the exchange field induced by the Ni ions onto the strongly exchange coupled Cu
spins. Second, the antiferromagnetic resonance was investigated in Ni-doped
samples. The frequency vs magnetic field relation of the resonance is well
explained by the classical theory with orthorhombic anisotropy, with $g$ values
remarkably reduced, in accordance with the study of the spin-Peierls and

demonstrate that the critical resistivity, $R_c$, at the nominal
insulator-superconductor transition is linearly proportional to the normal
sheet resistance, $R_N$. In addition, the critical magnetic field scales
linearly with the superconducting energy gap and is well-approximated by
$H_{c2}$. Because $R_N$ is determined at high temperatures and $H_{c2}$ is the
pair-breaking field, the two immediate consequences are: 1)
electron-quasiparticles populate the insulating side of the transition and 2)
standard phase-only models are incapable of describing the destruction of the
superconducting state. As gapless electronic excitations populate the
insulating state, the universality class is no longer the 3D XY model. The lack
of a unique critical resistance in homogeneously disordered films can be
understood in this context. In light of the recent experiments which observe an
intervening metallic state separating the insulator from the superconductor in
homogeneously disordered MoGe thin films, we argue that the two transitions
that accompany the destruction of superconductivity are 1) superconductor to
Bose metal in which phase coherence is lost and 2) Bose metal to localized
electron insulator via pair-breaking.

shown to be quantized in units of $\frac{\hbar}{8\pi}$. This result does not
rest on linearization of the BdG equations around Dirac nodes and therefore
includes inter-nodal physics in its entirety. In addition, this result holds
for a generic inversion-symmetric lattice of vortices as long as the magnetic
field $B$ satisfies $H_{c1} \ll B \ll H_{c2}$. We then derive the
Wiedemann-Franz law for the spin and thermal Hall conductivity in the vortex
state. In the limit of $T \to 0$, the thermal Hall conductivity satisfies
$\kappa_{x y}=\frac{4\pi^2}{3}(\frac{k_B}{\hbar})^2 T \sigma^s_{xy}$. The
transitions between different quantized values of $\sigma^s_{xy}$ as well as

system of two point-particles moving on a quasi-circular orbit whose decay by
emission of gravitational radiation is described by a post-Newtonian expansion.
In this paper we summarize the basics of the computation by means of a series
of multipole moments of the exterior field generated by an isolated source in
the post-Newtonian approximation. This computation relies on an ansatz of
matching the exterior multipolar field to the inner field of a slowly-moving
source. The formalism can be applied to point-particles at the price of a
further ansatz, that the infinite self-field of point-particles can be
regularized in a certain way. As it turns out, the concept of point-particle
requires a precise definition in high post-Newtonian approximations of general
relativity.

causal future directed vectors is non-negative is said to have the dominant
property. These tensors, up to sign, are called causal tensors, and we
determine their general properties in dimension N. We prove that rank-2 tensors
which map the null cone on itself are causal. It is known that, to any tensor A
on V there is a corresponding ``superenergy'' (s-e) tensor T{A} which always
has the dominant property. We prove that, conversely, any symmetric rank-2
tensor with the dominant property can be written in a canonical way as a sum of
N s-e tensors of simple forms. We show that the square of any rank-2 s-e tensor
is proportional to the metric if N<5, and that this holds for the s-e tensor of
any simple form for arbitrary N. Conversely, we prove that any symmetric rank-2
tensor T whose square is proportional to the metric must be, up to sign, the
s-e of a simple p-form, and that the trace of T determines the rank p of the
form. This generalises, both with respect to N and the rank p, the classical
algebraic Rainich conditions, which are necessary and sufficient conditions for
a metric to originate in some physical field, and has a geometric
interpretation: the set of s-e tensors of simple forms is precisely the set of
tensors which preserve the null cone and its time orientation. It also means
that all involutory Lorentz transformations (LT) can be represented as s-e
tensors of simple forms, and that any rank-2 s-e tensor is the sum of at most N
conformally involutory LT. Non-symmetric null cone preserving maps are shown to
have a causal symmetric part and are classified according to the null
eigenvectors of the skew-symmetric part. We thus obtain a complete
classification of all conformal LT and singular null cone preserving maps on V.

anomalous $Wtb$ couplings. Similar reasons favour the process $e^- e^- \to e^-
\nu_e \bar t b$ for probing top quark properties despite a considerably lower

anomalous $Wtb$ couplings, with best bounds found for $\gamma_+ e^-_L \to e^- t

then suggested that these ``topological discrete systems'' are a natural choice

to the phi^4 theory, we numerically investigate kink-antikink scattering and
breather formation in these topological lattices. Our results indicate that,
even though these systems are quite accurate for studying free kinks in coarse

restricted to fine lattices (h~0.1). We suggest that this fact is related to
the breaking of the Bogomol'nyi bound during the kink-antikink interaction,
where the field profile loses its static property as required by the
Bogomol'nyi argument. We conclude, therefore, that these lattices are not
suitable for the study of more general kink dynamics, since a standard

describe in a suitable sense the ``quotient'' category $\A/G$? We give a full
answer in the case when $\A=\vec$ is the category of vector spaces; in this
case, $\vec/G$ turns out to be the category of representation of Drinfeld's
double $D(G)$. This should be considered as category theory analog of
topological identity ${pt}//G=BG$. This implies a conjecture of Dijkgraaf,
Vafa, E. Verlinde and H. Verlinde regarding so-called orbifold conformal field
theories: if $\V$ is a vertex operator algebra which has a unique irreducible
module, $\V$ itself, and $G$ is a compact group of automorphisms of $\V$, and
some not too restricitive technical conditions are satisfied, then $G$ is
finite, and the category of representations of the algebra of invariants,
$\V^G$, is equivalent as a tensor category to the category of representations
of Drinfeld's double $D(G)$. We also get some partial results in the
non-holomorphic case, i.e. when $\V$ has more than one simple module.

of generalized coherent states in a manner that accounts for interference,
entanglement, and the linearity of dynamics without using the superposition
principle. The coherent state labels, which are essentially instructions for
preparing states, make it unnecessary to identify properties with projectors in
Hilbert space. This eliminates the so called ""eigenvalue-eigenstate"" link, and
the theory thereby escapes the measurement problem. What the theory allows us
to predict is the distribution in the outcomes of tests of relations between
coherent states. It is shown that quantum non-determinism can be attributed to
a hidden variable (noise) in the space of relations without violating the no-go
theorems (e.g. Kochen-Specker). It is shown that the coherent state vacuum is
distorted when entangled states are generated. The non-locality of the vacuum
permits this distortion to be felt everywhere without the transmission of a
signal and thereby accounts for EPR correlations in a manifestly covariant way.
