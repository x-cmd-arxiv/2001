composite supernova remnants. Such a remnant consists of both a plerionic and a
shell type component, corresponding respectively to the pulsar wind nebula
driven by the spindown luminosity of the central pulsar, and the blastwave
bounding the supernova remnant. Theoretical investigations including
hydrodynamical simulations have shown that at late times (~ 1,000 - 10,000
years), a simple scaling law connects the radius of the supernova shell to the
radius of the plerion. The energy content of the plerion and the total
mechanical energy of the supernova remnant enter into this scaling law. One can
use this scaling law to estimate the initial spin period of pulsars residing in
composite remnants. We discuss potential pitfalls of this method, including the
effect of a small remnant age and of strong radiative losses in the plerion.

determinations in low-metallicity extragalactic HII-regions. Such
determinations may be subject to systematic uncertainties that are investigated
here. Particular attention is paid to two effects: icf-corrections for
``imperfect'' ionization structure leading to significant amounts of
(unobservable) neutral helium or hydrogen and ``tcf''-corrections due to
non-uniform temperature. Model HII-regions with a large number of parameters
are constructed and it is shown that required corrections are almost
exclusively functions of two physical parameters: the number of helium- to
hydrogen- ionizing photons in the illuminating continuum Q(He0)/Q(H0), and the
ratio of width to radius delta r_S/r_S of the Stromgren sphere. For clouds of
sufficient He-ionizing photons Q(He0)/Q(H0) >~ 0.15 and non-negligible width of
the Stromgren sphere a significant overestimate of helium abundances may
result. Such clouds show radiation softness parameters in the range -0.4 <~
log(eta) <~ 0.3 coincident with the range of eta in observed HII-regions.
Existing data of HII-regions indeed seem to display a correlation which is
consistent with a typical ~ 2-4% overestimate of helium abundances due to these
effects. In case such an interpretation prevails, and in the absence of other
compensating effects, a significant downward revision of Y_p may result. It is
argued that caution should be exercised regarding the validity of commonly
quoted error bars on Y_p.

that CIV absorption systems are strongly clustered around galaxies on velocity
scales of v < 250 km/s and impact parameter scales of rho < 100 h^{-1} kpc but
not on larger velocity or impact parameter scales. Next, adopting measurements
of galaxy properties presented in previous papers, we examine how properties of
the CIV absorption systems depend on properties of the galaxies. On the basis
of 14 galaxy and absorber pairs and 36 galaxies that do not produce
corresponding CIV absorption lines to within sensitive upper limits, we find
that: (1) Galaxies of a range of morphological type and luminosity appear to
possess extended CIV gaseous envelopes of radius R ~ 100 h^{-1} kpc, with
abrupt boundaries between the CIV absorbing and non-absorbing regions. (2) The
extent of CIV-absorbing gas around galaxies scales with galaxy B-band
luminosity as R \propto L_B^{0.5 +/- 0.1} but does not depend strongly on
galaxy surface brightness, redshift, or morphological type. And (3) the
covering factor of CIV clouds within ~ 100 h^{-1} kpc of galaxies is nearly
unity, but there is a large scatter in the mean number of clouds encountered
along the line of sight. The most significant implication of the study is that
galaxies of a wide range of luminosity and morphological type are surrounded by
chemically enriched gas that extends for at least ~ 100 h^{-1} kpc. We consider
various scenarios that may have produced metals at large galactic distance and
conclude that accreting satellites are most likely to be responsible for
chemically enriched gas at large galactic distances to regular looking

compare the abundances obtained from our models with the available Li
measurements in Pop II stars. While it is widely accepted that the existence of
the Spite Li-plateau for these stars is a strong evidence that diffusion is
inhibited, we show that, when taking into account observational errors,
uncertainties in the Li abundance determinations, in the effective temperature
scale, and in particular the size of the observed samples of stars, the Spite
plateau and the Li abundances in subgiant branch stars can be reproduced also
by models including fully efficient diffusion, provided that the most
metal-poor field halo objects are between 13.5 and 14 Gyr old. We provide the
value of the minimum number of plateau stars to observe, for discriminating
between efficient or inhibited diffusion. From our models with diffusion we
derive that the average Li abundance along the Spite plateau is about a factor
of 2 lower than the primordial one. As a consequence, the derived primordial Li
abundance is consistent with a high helium and low deuterium Big Bang

many situations. The models show that the ionized gas has a density of ~10^4

about 10^4 Msun. The derived production rate of Lyman continuum photons is ~2.5
x 10^{52} /s in both the galaxies and the corresponding mass of stars (assuming
a Salpeter IMF) is ~10^5 msun. The implied stellar density shows that the
observed radio recombination lines arise from ionized gas around super star
clusters (SSCs) in both galaxies (these SSCs have been recently detected
through their radio continuum emission). The existence of ~10^4 Msun of ionized
gas within a few parsecs of an SSC places strict constraints on dynamical
models. Using simple arguments, the parameter space for a few possible models

4R(M/10^6M_{\odot})^{1/6}$ where $r$ is the orbital separation and $R$ the
stellar radius. We also show that corotation cannot be achieved for distant
orbits with $r \agt 12 R (M/10^6M_{\odot})^{-11/24}$, since the timescale for
viscous angular momentum transfer associated with tidal torques is longer than
the evolution timescale due to emission of thermal radiation. These facts
suggest that the allowed mass range and orbital separation for corotating
supermassive binary stars is severely restricted. In particular, for
supermassive binary stars of large mass $M \agt 6\times 10^6M_{\odot}$,
corotation cannot be achieved, as viscosity is not adequate to mediate the
transfer between orbital and spin angular momentum. One possible outcome for
binary supermassive stars is the onset of quasi-radial, relativistic
instability which drives each star to collapse prior to merger: We discuss
alternative outcomes of collapse and possible spin states of the resulting
black holes. We estimate the frequency and amplitude of gravitational waves
emitted during several inspiral and collapse scenarios.

out for a wide range of stiffness of equations of state and compactness of

typical grid size $(293,293,147)$ in $(x,y,z)$ assuming a plane symmetry with
respect to the equatorial plane. A result of one new large-scale simulation
performed with grid size $(505,505,253)$ is also presented.
  We find that the final product depends sensitively on the initial compactness
of the neutron stars: In a merger between sufficiently compact neutron stars, a
black hole is formed in a dynamical timescale. As the compactness is decreased,
the formation timescale becomes longer and longer. For less compact cases, a
differentially rotating massive neutron star is formed instead of a black hole.
In the case of black hole formation, the disk mass around the black hole
appears to be smaller than 1% of the total rest mass. It is also indicated that
waveforms of high-frequency gravitational waves after merger depend strongly on
the compactness of neutron stars.

changes of the guiding centre radii of the stellar orbits induced by this

that even when the on-site Coulomb repulsion, U, is much smaller than the

Consequently, the Hubbard model at half-filling is always in the
strong-coupling non-perturbative regime. For both large and small U, we find
that the population of nearest-neighbour singlet states approaches a value of
order unity as $T\to 0$ as would be expected for antiferromagnetic order. We
also find that the double occupancy is a smooth monotonic function of U and
approaches the anticipated non-interacting limit and large U limits. Finally,
in our results for the heat capacity in 1D differ by no more than 1% from the
Bethe ansatz predictions. In addition, we find that in 2D, the heat capacity vs
T for different values of U exhibits a universal crossing point at two
characteristic temperatures as is seen experimentally in a wide range of
strongly-correlated systems such as $^3He$, $UBe_3$, and $CeCu_{6-x}Al_x$. The
success of this method in recovering well-established results that stem

properties of the fiber assembly. The computation naturally embeds the fiber

allowing a straightforward prediction of the force-extension curves. We show
that these elastic constants are strongly sensitive to the linker length, up to
1 bp, or equivalently to its twist, and might locally reach very low values,
yielding a highly flexible and extensible domain in the fiber. In particular,
the twist-stretch coupling constant, reflecting the chirality of the chromatin

temperature and zero temperature simulations were performed to find the jump of

investigate the black body limit (BBL) of high energy Deep Inelastic Scattering
of highly virtual photons off heavy nuclear targets and thereby probe QCD in a
new regime. At high enough energies, whichever hadronic configuration the
photon fluctuates into, the interaction at a given impact parameter with the
heavy nuclear target will eventually reach its geometrical limit corresponding
to the scattering from a black disk. An attractive feature of the BBL regime
for a large nucleus is that the interaction is strong although the coupling
constant is small. Predictions for longitudinal and transverse distributions of
the leading hadrons in inclusive and diffractive channels and exclusive vector
meson production are found to be strikingly different in BBL and the leading
twist approximation. In particular, the multiplicity of leading hadrons in the
current fragmentation region is strongly suppressed, while the cross section of
diffractive vector meson production by longitudinally polarized photons is $
\propto 1/Q^2$. The x and $Q^2$ ranges where BBL maybe reached are calculated
for the interaction of color triplet and color octet dipoles at central impact
parameters. We conclude that for heavy nuclei THERA would reach deep into BBL
for a wide range of $Q^2$. The connection between hard diffraction and leading
twist nuclear shadowing is analysed. It is demonstrated that the current
leading twist analyses of the HERA diffractive data lead to similar and very

charmonia are expected to be strikingly different from what is known for the
energy of the SPS. One cannot think any more of charmonium produced on a bound
nucleon which then attenuates as it passes through the rest of the nucleus. The
coherence length of charmonium production substantially exceeds the nuclear
radius in the new energy range. Therefore the production amplitudes on
different nucleons, rather than the cross sections, add up and interfere, i.e.
shadowing is at work. So far no theoretical tool has been available to
calculate nuclear effects for charmonium production in this energy regime. We
develop a light-cone Green function formalism which incorporates the effects of
the coherence of the production amplitudes and of charmonium wave function
formation, and is the central result of this paper. We found a substantial
deviation from QCD factorization, namely, gluon shadowing is much stronger for
charmonium production than it is in DIS. We predict for nuclear effects $x_2$
scaling which is violated at lower energies by initial state energy loss which
must be also included in order to compare with available data. In this paper
only the indirect J/Psi originating from decay of P-wave charmonia are
considered. The calculated x_F-dependence of J/Psi nuclear suppression is in a
good accord with data. We predict a dramatic variation of nuclear suppression
with x_F in pA and a peculiar peak at x_F=0 in AA collisions at RHIC.

matter create a minimum at x_F=0, which is especially deep and narrow if a
quark-gluon plasma is formed. While a particularly strong effect is predicted
at SPS, at the higher RHIC energy it overlaps with the expected sharp variation
with x_F of nuclear effects and needs comparison with proton-nucleus data. If
thermal enhancement of J/\Psi production takes over at the energies of RHIC and
LHC, it will form an easily identified peak, rather than dip in x_F dependence.
We predict a steep dependence on centrality and suggest that this new probe is
complementary to the dependence on transverse energy, and is more sensitive to
a scenario of final state interactions.

and $0 < \Delta a_\mu < 11 \times 10^{-10}$ ($2\sigma$ below). In mSUGRA model,
the counting ratio may be above the sensitivity of the future experiments when
parameters are within $1\sigma$ bound of $\Delta a_{\mu}$. However, the
$\Omega_{\chi}$ tends to be high compared to the currently favored value
$\Omega=0.3$. For models with the non-universal scalar masses, the possibility
to have the consistent $\Omega_{\chi}$ and the high counting ratio is open up
in the region of parameter space where Higgsino mass $\mu$ is smaller than
mSUGRA prediction. In particular, in the SO(10) model, the LSP dark matter
detection rate may be enhanced by almost one order of magnitude compared to
mSUGRA and the model with non-universal Higgs mass, for cosmologically
acceptable $\Omega_{\chi} h^2$. The highest detection rate of LSP dark matter
occurs in the region where the LSP constitutes a subdominant part of local halo
DM. Implication of SUSY mass parameter measurement under the cosmological

  Reductions",,,,,"hep-th",,"  A high temperature expansion is employed to map some complex anisotropic
nonhermitian three and four dimensional Ising models with algebraic long range
interactions into a solvable two dimensional variant. We also address the
dimensional reductions for anisotropic two dimensional XY and other models. For
the latter and related systems it is possible to have an effective reduction in
the dimension without the need of compactifying some dimensions. Some solutions
are presented. This framework further allows for some very simple general
observations. It will be seen that the absence of a ``phase interference''
effect plays an important role in high dimensional problems. A very forbidding
purely algebraic recursive series solution to the three dimensional nearest
neighbor Ising model will be given. In the aftermath, the full-blown three
dimensional nearest neighbor Ising model is exactly mapped onto a single spin
1/2 particle with nontrivial dynamics. All this allows for a formal high
dimensional Bosonization.

spectator matter acquires a transverse momentum $<P^x /A>$ that shows
sensitivity to the nuclear incompressibility and to the momentum dependence of
the nuclear mean field (MF). An observed change in the net average momentum per

dependence of the MF. For a momentum-dependent MF and a low impact parameter in

its source materials E with rate $\gamma$. In the asymptotic regime the
population can be characterized by the presence (active phase) and the absence

that for small values of the ratio c/$\gamma$ these phases are separated by a
second-order phase transition which is in the universality class of the
directed percolation, while for small values s/$gamma$ the phase transition is
of first order. Furthermore, we illustrate the suitability of the dynamic Monte
Carlo method, which is based on the analysis of the spreading behaviour of a
