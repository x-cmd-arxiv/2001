produce the accelerated expansion in the universe suggested by recent

a cosmological constant is that the energy density in quintessence,
$\Omega_\phi$, could be a significant fraction of the overall energy even in
the early universe, while the cosmological constant will be dynamically
relevant only at late times. We use standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the
observed abundances of primordial nuclides to put constraints on $\Omega_\phi$
at temperatures near $T \sim 1MeV$. We point out that current experimental data
does not support the presence of such a field, providing the strong constraint
$\Omega_\phi(MeV) < 0.045$ at $2\sigma$ C.L. and strengthening previous
results. We also consider the effect a scaling field has on CMB anisotropies
using the recent data from Boomerang and DASI, providing the CMB constraint
$\Omega_\phi \le 0.39$ at $2\sigma$ during the radiation dominated epoch.

focussing on the ambiguities originated in the simplifying hypotheses aimed at
observationally verifying if the large-scale distribution of galaxies is
homogeneous, and conjecturing that this distribution should follow a fractal
pattern in perturbed standard cosmologies. This is due to a geometrical effect,
appearing when certain types of average densities are calculated along the past
light cone. The paper starts reviewing the argument concerning the possibility
that the galaxy distribution follows such a scaling pattern, and the premises
behind the assumption that the spatial homogeneity of standard cosmology can be
observable. Next, it is argued that to discuss observable homogeneity one needs
to make a clear distinction between local and average relativistic densities,
and showing how the different distance definitions strongly affect them,
leading the various average densities to display asymptotically opposite
behaviours. Then the paper revisits Ribeiro's (1995: astro-ph/9910145) results,
showing that in a fully relativistic treatment some observational average
densities of the flat Friedmann model are not well defined at z ~ 0.1, implying
that at this range average densities behave in a fundamentally different manner
as compared to the linearity of the Hubble law, well valid for z < 1. This
conclusion brings into question the widespread assumption that relativistic
corrections can always be neglected at low z. It is also shown how some key
features of fractal cosmologies can be found in the Friedmann models. In view
of those findings, it is suggested that the so-called contradiction between the
cosmological principle, and the galaxy distribution forming an unlimited
fractal structure, may not exist.

known difference of ~0.5 mag in average optical luminosity between FRI and FRII
radio galaxies as a simple selection effect. Specifically, FRII appear
preferentially in smaller galaxies because both radio and optical luminosity
functions are steep, so there is a negligible probability of observing a

Composite starburst+Seyfert 2 systems can be recognized by: (1) a strong
``Featureless Continuum'' which dilutes the CaII K line from the host's bulge

between Starburst galaxies and ``pure'' Seyfert 2's; (3) relatively low

star magnetosphere during the both types of flares is required. The accretion
disk can be formed at the periastron if (i) the expansion velocity of the Be
star envelope in the equatorial plane is V_wr < 150 km/s and (ii) the parameter
accounting for the accretion flow inhomogeneities, xi, satisfies the following

symmetrical accretion onto the interchange-stable magnetosphere of the neutron

of Lithium-Beryllium-Boron (LiBeB) since it is the main producer of these light

determination of the exact physical process responsible for the LiBeB
production. At low metallicity, if [O/Fe] vs [Fe/H] is flat, then the
production mode is independent of the interstellar metallicity, BeB is
proportional to oxygen, i.e. is of primary nature. If not, the production mode
is function of the progressive enrichment in O of the interstellar medium, BeB
varies rather as the square of O, i.e. is of secondary nature. In the first
case, fast nuclei enriched into He, C and O injected by supernovae and
accelerated in surrounding superbubbles would explain the primary trend.
  In the second case, the main spallative agent would be the standard galactic
cosmic rays. Calculated nucleosynthetic yields of massive stars, estimates of
the energy cost of production of beryllium nuclei, and above all recent
observations reported in this meeting seem to favor the primary mechanism, at

the atmosphere with $\rho\ga 10^2$ g/cm$^3$, plasma effects can significantly
modify the photon opacities by changing the properties of the polarization

equations for both polarization modes. We also construct atmosphere models for
general field orientations based on the diffusion approximation of the
transport equations and compare the results with models based on full radiative
transport. In general, the emergent thermal radiation exhibits significant
deviation from blackbody, with harder spectra at high energies. The spectra
also show a broad feature ($\Delta E/\Ebi\sim 1$) around the ion cyclotron

should trace the lower boundary N_f^* of the conformal window in QCD and

infrared fixed point is present in the perturbative part of the QCD coupling
even in some range below N_f^* leads to the condition gamma(N_f^*)=1, where
gamma is the critical exponent. This result is incompatible with the existence
of an analogue of Seiberg free dual magnetic phase in QCD. Using the Banks-Zaks
expansion, one gets
  4<N_f^*<6. The low value of N_f^* gives some justification to the infrared
finite coupling approach to power corrections, and suggests a way to compute
their normalization from perturbative input. If the perturbative series are
still asymptotic in the negative coupling region, the presence of a negative
ultraviolet fixed point is required both in QCD and in supersymmetric QCD to
preserve causality within the conformal window. Some evidence for such a fixed
point in QCD is provided through a modified Banks-Zaks expansion. Conformal
window amplitudes, which contain power contributions, are shown to remain
generically finite in the N_f=-\infty one-loop limit in simple models with

WIMPZILLA gravitational production in hybrid-inflation models and
natural-inflation models. Generalizing these findings, we also explore the

by the future linear colliders, whereas for the other two cases, this ratio is
too low to be observed even in the near future for all possible LFV Z decay

general categorical construction (used also by Kontsevich and Rosenberg to
define ""noncommutative schemes""). We prove a conjecture of Kazhdan which says
that the D-module counterpart of the Kazhdan-Laumon gluing construction
produces a category equivalent to modules over the ring $\mathcal D$ of global
differential operators on the basic affine space. As an application we show
that $\mathcal D$ is Noetherian, and has finite injective dimension as a module
over itself.

curves over finite fields. Modular curves of genus g -> infty over a field of

Both the theory and possible practical use of these new record codes require
the development of new tools. On the theoretical side, establishing the
transmission rate depends on an error estimate for a theorem of Schanuel
