physics allows to obtain very detailed models which can be ultimately compared
with their observed properties. Among white dwarfs there is a specific class of
stars, known as ZZ-Ceti objects, which have a hydrogen-rich envelope and show
periodic variations in their light curves. G117-B15A belongs to this particular
set of stars. The luminosity variations have been successfully explained as due
to g-mode pulsations. G117-B15A has been recently claimed to be the most stable
optical clock ever found, being the rate of change of its 215.2 s period very
small: \dot{P}= (2.3 +- 1.4)x10^{-15} s s^-1, with a stability comparable to
that of the most stable millisecond pulsars. The rate of change of the period
is closely related to its cooling timescale, which can be accurately computed.
In this paper we study the pulsational properties of G117-B15A and we use the
observed rate of change of the period to impose constraints on the axion
emissivity and, thus, to obtain a preliminary upper bound to the mass of the
axion. This upper bound turns out to be 4cos^{2}{\beta} meV at the 95%
confidence level. Although there are still several observational and
theoretical uncertainties, we conclude that G117-B15A is a very promising
stellar object to set up constraints on particle physics.

an estimate of the central disk surface brightness mu_{0,K} and the disk
scale-length h. There exists a bright envelope of galaxy disks in the
mu_{0,K}-log h diagram; for the early-type (<Sc) disk galaxies mu_{0,K} is
shown to increase with log h, with a slope of ~2 and a correlation coefficient
equal to 0.75. This relation exists over a range of disk scale-lengths from 0.5

can be used for distinction between scalar and tensor gravitational waves
because of the anisotropy of spatial galaxy distribution. For calculation of
the expected amplitudes of GW signals we use the values of the released GW
energy, frequency and duration of GW pulse which are consistent with existing
scenarios of SN core collapse. The amplitudes of the signals produced by Virgo
and the Great Attractor clusters of galaxies is expressed as a function of the
sidereal time for resonant bar detectors operating now (IGEC) and for
forthcoming laser interferometric detectors (VIRGO).Then, we calculate the
expected number of GW events as a function of sidereal time produced by all the
galaxies within 100 Mpc. In the case of axisymmetric rotational core collapse
which radiates a GW energy of $10^{-9}M_{\odot}c^2$, only the closest
explosions can be detected. However, in the case of nonaxisymmetric supernova
explosion, due to such phenomena as centrifugal hangup, bar and lump formation,
the GW radiation could be as strong as that from a coalescing neutron-star
binary. For radiated GW energy higher than $10^{-6}M_{\odot}c^2$ and
sensitivity of detectors at the level $h \approx 10^{-23}$ it is possible to

state (EOS) of strange quark matter based on the MIT Bag Model with massive
strange quarks and lowest order QCD interactions. The crust is described by the
BPS equation of state. A significant increase of the stellar radius is found
close to the Keplerian (mass-shedding limit) configuration. This leads to the
disappearance of the gap between the stellar surface and the innermost stable
circular orbit (ISCO) at very high rotation rates, for a rather broad range of
stellar masses. The Keplerian configuration for the strange star with crust
corresponds to values of J, T/W which are about 20% smaller than in the case of
bare strange stars. Because the Keplerian configuration is achieved due to the
increase of the stellar oblateness, the Keplerian frequency (of the rotation)
remains almost unaltered. The lack of the gap close to the Keplerian rotation
could imply a more stringent limit on the frequency of the ISCO, if the
existence of such a gap is supported by observations, as in the source 4U
1820-30 with the upper QPO frequency 1.07 kHz. During the spin-down of a
magnetized strange quark star with crust, the crust matter is absorbed in the

the Fermilab E706 Collaboration for 530 and 800 GeV/c protons incident on light
nuclear targets (mass $A$) like Be. The essential idea is that such high
incident projectile momenta tend to break up the confinement barriers for the
quark-partons residing in the individual nucleonic constituents of the target
nucleus that fall in a tube-like zone around the projectile's path, so that
these particles tend to behave as a collection of quark-partons confronting the
beam. Using simple combinatorial principles, the resultant $<k_T>^2$ value
works out as $(3A_{eff}-1) \beta^2$, where $A_{eff}$ is the number of affected
nucleons in the tube-like zone, and $\beta$ is a scale parameter derived from
the basic quark-pair interaction. Using the previously found results of a
Bethe-Salpeter model (attuned to $q{\bar q}$ and $qqq$ spectroscopy), one in
which a key ingredient is the infrared part of the gluon propagator, giving
$\beta^2= 0.068 GeV^2$, the desired $<k_T>$ range is reproduced, suggesting the
persistence of $soft$ QCD effects even at high $p_T$. Keywords: Direct photon;

dense liquids. The situation of hard-core interactions is addressed by
considering the binding of solvent molecules to a precisely defined `cavity' in
order to assess the probability that the `cavity' is entirely evacuated. The
primitive quasi-chemical approximation corresponds to a extension of the
Poisson distribution used as a default model in an information theory approach.
This primitive quasi-chemical theory is in good qualitative agreement with the
observations for the hard sphere fluid of occupancy distributions that are
central to quasi-chemical theories but begins to be quantitatively erroneous
for the equation of state in the dense liquid regime of $\rho d^3>$0.6. How the
quasi-chemical approach can be iterated to treat correlation effects is
addressed. Consideration of neglected correlation effects leads to a simple
model for the form of those contributions neglected by the primitive
quasi-chemical approximation. These considerations, supported by simulation
observations, identify a `break away' phenomena that requires special
thermodynamic consideration for the zero (0) occupancy case as distinct from
the rest of the distribution. A empirical treatment leads to a one parameter
model occupancy distribution that accurately fits the hard sphere equation of
state and observed distributions.

under certain conditions. A difference in the expression level of a gene at two
different conditions/phenotypes, such as cancerous versus non-cancerous, one
subtype of cancer versus another, before versus after a drug treatment, is
indicative of the relevance of that gene to the difference of the high-level
phenotype. Each gene can be ranked by its ability to distinguish the two
conditions. We study how the single-gene classification ability decreases with
its rank (a Zipf's plot). Power-law function in the Zipf's plot is observed for
the four microarray datasets obtained from various cancer studies. This
power-law behavior in the Zipf's plot is reminiscent of similar power-law
curves in other natural and social phenomena (Zipf's law). However, due to our
choice of the measure of importance in classification ability, i.e., the
maximized likelihood in a logistic regression, the exponent of the power-law
function is a function of the sample size, instead of a fixed value close to 1
for a typical example of Zipf's law. The presence of this power-law behavior is
important for deciding the number of genes to be used for a discriminant
microarray data analysis.

expression levels are measured, not all are needed for discriminant analysis: a
gene may either not contribute to the separation of two types of
tissues/cancers, or it may be redundant because it is highly correlated with
other genes. There are two theoretical frameworks in which variable selection
(or gene selection in our case) can be addressed. The first is model selection,
and the second is model averaging. We have carried out model selection using
Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion with logistic
regression (discrimination, prediction, or classification) to determine the
number of genes that provide the best model. These model selection criteria set
upper limits of 22-25 and 12-13 genes for this data set with 38 samples, and
the best model consists of only one (no.4847, zyxin) or two genes. We have also
carried out model averaging over the best single-gene logistic predictors using
three different weights: maximized likelihood, prediction rate on training set,
and equal weight. We have observed that the performance of most of these
weighted predictors on the testing set is gradually reduced as more genes are
included, but a clear cutoff that separates good and bad prediction performance
is not found.
