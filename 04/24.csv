ApJ, in press",,"10.1086/322479",,"astro-ph",,"  The radio components associated with the LMXB Sco X-1 have been monitored
with extensive VLBI imaging at 1.7 and 5.0 GHz over four years, including a
56-hour continuous VLBI observation in 1999 June. We often detected one strong
and one weak compact radio component, moving in opposite directions from the
radio core. We suggest that the moving components are radio lobes generated by
the disruption of energy flow in a twin-beam from the binary system. The
average lifetime of a lobe-pair, the space motion of the lobes and the measured
energy flow in the beam are discussed in arXiv:astro-ph/0104325. The lobe has a
flux density that is variable over a time-scale of one hour, a measured minimum
size of 1 mas (2.8 au), and is extended perpendicular to its motion. This short
electron radiative lifetime may be caused by synchrotron losses if the lobe
magnetic field is 300 G, or by adiabatic expansion of the electrons as soon as
they are produced at the working surface. The lobes also show periods of slow
expansion and a steepening radio spectrum, perhaps related to the
characteristics of the beam energy flow. The radio morphology for Sco X-1 is
more simple than for most other Galactic jet sources. The lobes of Sco X-1 are
similar to hot-spots found in many extragalactic double sources. Scaling the
phenomena observed in Sco X-1 to extragalactic sources implies hot-spot
variability time-scales of 10^4 yr and hot-spot lifetimes of 10^5 yr. The
recurrent formation of lobes in Sco X-1 probably does not occur for
extragalactic radio sources.

collimated jet propagates into the surrounding medium. Under interstellar

flow is appropriate beyond the working surface where the jet impacts its
surroundings. The solution is then determined by the ambient and jet densities
and velocities and by the momentum impulse applied in the working surface.
Using estimates for these impulses (confirmed by separate numerical
simulations), we obtain solutions for the shell structure, and for the range of
velocities in the shell at any point. We provide predictions for the
position-velocity and mass-velocity relations expected for plane-of-sky
bow-shock shells, and for the bulk shell properties. In a companion paper, we
show that these analytic solutions are in excellent agreement with the results
of direct numerical simulations. We argue that classical molecular (CO)
outflows cannot be purely jet-driven, because the bow-shock shell solutions are
much too elongated compared with observations. Finally, we suggest that the
``spur'' structures seen in position-velocity diagrams of observed molecular
outflows are the manifestation of internal bow shocks which may be fit with our

applied to 18 low-redshift Calan/Tololo SNe with z < 0.11; these nearly 300
B-band photometry points are found to lie on the composite curve equally well.
The SCP search technique produces several measurements before maximum light for

equally well to the declining and rising parts of the light curve. In fact, the
B-band template that best fits this composite curve fits the individual
supernova photometry data when stretched by a factor s with chi^2/DoF approx =

highly varying rotation measures along the shell. The percentage polarization
is rather low (~2%) and we conclude that G11.2-0.3 is in the transient phase
from free to adiabatic expansion. The central flat spectrum component is partly

correction to the electrostatic interaction between electrons is calculated. It
is shown that taking into account the correction due to the piezoelectric
effect leads to a dependence of the total energy of the electron crystal on its
orientation with respect to the crystallographic axes of the surrounding
matrix. A generalization of Ewald's method is obtained for calculating the
anisotropic interaction between electrons in a Wigner crystal. The method is
used to calculate the energy of bilayer Wigner crystals in electron layers
parallel to the crystallographic planes (001), (0-11), and (111) as a function
of their orientation and the distance between layers, and the energetically
most favorable orientation for all types of electron lattices in a bilayer
system is found. It is shown that phase transitions between structures with
different lattice symmetry in a Wigner crystal can be accompanied by a change
of its orientation.

there is only a single transition from the square pinned lattice to the liquid

melting in which the interstitial vortices become mobile first, followed by the
melting of the entire lattice, consistent with recent imaging experiments. The
initial motion of vortices in the incommensurate phase occurs by an exchange
process of interstitial vortices with vortices located at the pinning sites. We
have also examined the vortex melting behavior for higher matching fields and
find that a coexistence of a commensurate pinned vortex lattice with an

$\Omega_{ln}$ and of the Coulomb pseudopotential $\mu^*$ reproduce the

show quantitatively that the obtained values of $\lambda$ and $\Omega_{ln}$
strongly violate Migdal's theorem and consequently are incompatible with the

  schemes with radial basis function","Welcome any comments to wenc@ifi.uio.no or chenw6@hotmail.com",,,,"cs.NA cs.CE",,"  This paper is concerned with a few novel RBF-based numerical schemes
discretizing partial differential equations. For boundary-type methods, we
derive the indirect and direct symmetric boundary knot methods (BKM). The
resulting interpolation matrix of both is always symmetric irrespective of
boundary geometry and conditions. In particular, the direct BKM applies the
practical physical variables rather than expansion coefficients and becomes
very competitive to the boundary element method. On the other hand, based on
the multiple reciprocity principle, we invent the RBF-based boundary particle
method (BPM) for general inhomogeneous problems without a need using inner
nodes. The direct and symmetric BPM schemes are also developed.
  For domain-type RBF discretization schemes, by using the Green integral we
develop a new Hermite RBF scheme called as the modified Kansa method (MKM),
which differs from the symmetric Hermite RBF scheme in that the MKM discretizes
both governing equation and boundary conditions on the same boundary nodes. The
local spline version of the MKM is named as the finite knot method (FKM). Both
MKM and FKM significantly reduce calculation errors at nodes adjacent to
boundary. In addition, the nonsingular high-order fundamental or general
solution is strongly recommended as the RBF in the domain-type methods and dual
reciprocity method approximation of particular solution relating to the BKM.
  It is stressed that all the above discretization methods of boundary-type and
domain-type are symmetric, meshless, and integration-free. The spline-based
schemes will produce desirable symmetric sparse banded interpolation matrix. In
appendix, we present a Hermite scheme to eliminate edge effect on the RBF
geometric modeling and imaging.

critical phenomena well-known in {\em Statistical Mechanics} and {\em Quantum
Field Theory}. Universality and echoing of the critical solution and power-law
scaling of the black hole masses have given rise to the name {\em Critical

conformal transformation of the Einstein -- Hilbert action, the conformal
factor represents a scalar field with the negative kinetical term and the
self-interaction inspired by the cosmological constant. (It has been found that
quanta of such action have a negative value as a sequence of the negative
energy.) The metric energy-momentum tensor of this scalar field is proportional
to the Einstein tensor for the initial metric. Therefore, a vacuum state of the

factor of the flat Friedmann Universe. It is shown that conformal factor may be
viewed as a an inflaton field, and its small non-homogeneities represent gauge

sources of very-high-energy radiation, as a result of an unstable spacetime
distortion that follows a D0-particle/closed string state scattering. The
effect can happen only if the energy of the incident particle/closed string
state exceeds a certain threshold, which is of order of the subsequently
radiated energy. In this letter we speculate on the possibility of detection of
the D-particles due to this phenomenon. The energies of the emitted radiation
range in a narrow window of size less than one order of magnitude.
Observation-wise, this radiation will appear as an excess of photons in a
narrow band in the spectrum of high energy cosmic rays. From their energy we
can then read off the value of the product of the string mass scale times the
string coupling. We speculate on the possibility that high energy neutrinos
from GRB's play the r\^ole of the necessary high energy flux that triggers the
effect, by striking D-particles lying inside the mean free path of the photons
as measured from Earth. The possibilty of this effect operating as a mechanism
of GZK cutoff violation is also pointed out.

which $F_{tt}$ has a sign opposite to the one in the Standard Model, i.e.
$F_{tt}<0$, the data for $(\epsilon_K, \Delta M_{d,s})$ imply an absolute lower
bound on the $B_d\to\psi K_{S}$ CP asymmetry $a_{\psi K_S}$ of 0.69, which is
substantially stronger than 0.42 arising in the case of $F_{tt}>0$. An
important finding of this paper is the observation that for given

$Br(K_{L}\to\pi^0\nu\overline{\nu})$, corresponding to the two signs of $X$,
are possible in the full class of MFV models, independently of any new

class of models. Moreover, we derive absolute lower and upper bounds on

  holomorphic nilpotent orbit, the closure is now shown to be normal as a
  complex analytic space","Memoirs AMS 172/814 (2004)",,,"math.DG math-ph math.AG math.MP math.SG",,"  For a stratified symplectic space, a suitable concept of stratified Kaehler
polarization, defined in terms of an appropriate Lie-Rinehart algebra,
encapsulates Kaehler polarizations on the strata and the behaviour of the
polarizations across the strata and leads to the notion of stratified Kaehler
space. This notion establishes an intimate relationship between nilpotent
orbits, singular reduction, invariant theory, reductive dual pairs, Jordan
triple systems, symmetric domains, and pre-homogeneous spaces; in particular,
in the world of singular Poisson geometry, the closures of principal
holomorphic nilpotent orbits, positive definite hermitian JTS's, and certain
pre-homogeneous spaces appear as different incarnations of the same structure.
The space of representations of the fundamental group of a closed surface in a
compact Lie group inherits a (positive) normal (stratified) Kaehler structure,
as does the closure of a holomorphic nilpotent orbit in a semisimple Lie
algebra of hermitian type. The closure of the principal holomorphic nilpotent
orbit arises from a regular semisimple holomorphic orbit by contraction.
Symplectic reduction carries a (positive) Kaehler manifold to a (positive)
normal Kaehler space in such a way that the sheaf of germs of polarized
functions thereupon coincides with the ordinary sheaf of germs of holomorphic
functions. Symplectic reduction establishes a close relationship between
singular reduced spaces and nilpotent orbits of the dual groups.
Projectivization of holomorphic nilpotent orbits yields exotic stratified
Kaehler structures on complex projective spaces and on certain complex
projective varieties including complex projective quadrics. Physical examples
are provided by certain reduced spaces arising from angular momentum zero.

A, 64: 032111 (2001)","10.1103/PhysRevA.64.032111",,"quant-ph",,"  We present a general framework for sensitivity optimization in quantum
parameter estimation schemes based on continuous (indirect) observation of a
dynamical system. As an illustrative example, we analyze the canonical scenario
of monitoring the position of a free mass or harmonic oscillator to detect weak
classical forces. We show that our framework allows the consideration of
sensitivity scheduling as well as estimation strategies for non-stationary
signals, leading us to propose corresponding generalizations of the Standard
Quantum Limit for force detection.

form (e.g. the Heisenberg interaction), then one must be able to ""switch it
off"" in order to prevent uncontrolled propagation of states. Therefore, such QC
schemes typically demand local control of the interaction strength between each
pair of neighboring qubits. Here we demonstrate that this degree of control is
not necessary: it suffices to switch the interaction collectively - something
that can in principle be achieved by global fields rather than with local
manipulations. This observation may offer a significant simplification for
various solid state, optical lattice and NMR implementations.

state is considered. We describe a class of states of the quantum field for
wich a stationary state drives the system to inverse populated state. We find
that the quotient of the population of the energy levels in the simplest case
is described by the double Einstein formula which involves products of two
Einstein emission/absorption relations. Emission and absorption of radiation by
3-level atom in non-equlibrium stationary state is described.

non-equilibrium state is considered. The stochastic limit, applied to the
non-relativistic Hamiltonian describing the interaction, shows that the state
of atoms, driven by some non-equilibrium state of the field approaches a
stationary state which can continuously emit photon, unlike the case with an
equilibrium state.
