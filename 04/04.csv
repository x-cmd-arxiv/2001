dipole magnetic field of a rotating star. Ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is
assumed with the pressure and density related as $p \propto \rho^\gamma$ and
with $\rho {\bf v}^2 \ll {\bf B}^2/4\pi$, where ${\bf v}$ is the flow velocity.
This limit corresponds to the Alfv\'en radius for the disk accretion larger
than the corotation radius. Transonic flows, which go from subsonic motion near
the disk to supersonic inflow near the star, are shown to be possible only for
a narrow range of $R_d \sim r_c \equiv (GM/\Omega^2)^{1/3}$, where $R_d$ is the
radius at which the dipole field line intersects the disk, $r_c$ the corotation
radius, $M$ the mass of the star, and $\Omega$ its angular rotation rate. The
transonic flows have very different behaviors for $\gamma > 7/5$ and $< 7/5$.
In both cases, the plasma flow velocity ${\bf v}$ (which is parallel to ${\bf
B}$) increases with decreasing distance $R$ from the star. However, for $\gamma
>7/5$, the Mach number ${\cal M} \equiv |{\bf v}|/c_s$ (with $c_s$ the sound
speed) initially increases with $R$ decreasing from $R_d$, but for $R$
decreasing from $\approx 0.22 R_d$ (for $\gamma=5/3$)the Mach number
surprisingly {\it decreases}. In the other limit, $\gamma < 7/5$, ${\cal M}$
increases monotonically with decreasing $R$. Application of these results is
made to funnel flows to rotating magnetized neutron stars and young stellar
objects.

Hubeny CIRCUS code, we demonstate that periodic UV continuum fluxes can be
explained by the absorption of low-excitation lines. The analysis also
quantifies the cloud temperatures, densities, and turbulences, which appear to
increase inward toward the stars. The temperatures range from about 12,000K for
the weak Fe lines up to temperatures of 33,000K for N V absorptions, which is

binaries (LMXBs) associated with this galaxy. The dominance of LMXBs indicates
that X-ray faint early-type galaxies have lost much of their interstellar gas.
On the other hand, a modest portion of the X-ray emission from NGC 4697 is due
to hot gas. The X-ray emitting gas in NGC 4697 has a rather low temperature (kT
= 0.29 keV). The emission from the gas is very extended, with a much flatter
surface brightness profile than the optical light, and has an irregular,
L-shaped morphology. X-ray spectra of the resolved sources and diffuse emission
show that the soft X-ray spectral component, found in this and other X-ray
faint ellipticals with {\it ROSAT}, is due to interstellar gas. The cumulative
LMXB spectrum is well-fit by thermal bremsstrahlung at kT = 8.1 keV, without a
significant soft component. Three of the resolved sources in NGC 4697 are
supersoft sources. In the outer regions of NGC 4697, seven of the LMXBs (about
20%) are coincident with candidate globular clusters, which indicates that
globulars have a high probability of containing X-ray binaries compared to the
normal stellar population. The luminosity function of the LMXBs has a ``knee''
at 3.2 x 10^38 ergs/s, which is approximately the Eddington luminosity of a 1.4
Msun neutron star (NS). This knee appears to be a characteristic feature of the
LMXB population of early-type galaxies, and we argue that it separates black
hole and NS binaries. This characteristic luminosity could be used as a

the derived O abundances using 3D models are found to be systematically lower

doubts on the recent claims for a monotonic increase in [O/Fe] towards lower
metallicities. In fact, taken at face value the resulting 3D LTE trend is in
rough agreement with the conventional [O/Fe] plateau. Caution must, however, be
exercised in view of the remaining assumptions in the 3D calculations. We have
verified that the stellar parameters remain essentially unchanged with 3D model
atmospheres provided that the infrared flux method, Hipparcos parallaxes and
FeII lines are utilised, leaving the 3D O abundances from OH lines largely

the derived O abundances again. Non-LTE line formation calculations with 1D
model atmospheres suggest no significant steepening of the [O/Fe] trend even if
the abundance corrections amount to about 0.2 dex for all investigated stellar
parameters. We note, however, that the 3D case may not necessarily be as

has been preheated by external entropy sources at the time of gravitational
collapse, as can be inferred from the luminosity-temperature (LT) relation of
galaxy clusters and groups. We also make a rough estimate of this effect by a
simple model, showing that the EGRB flux may be suppressed by a factor of about
30. Hence structure formation is difficult to be the dominant origin of EGRB if
preheating is actually responsible for the observed anomary in the LT relation.
The detectable number of gamma-ray clusters is also reduced, but about 5-10
forming clusters should still be detectable by EGRET all sky, and this number
is similar to that of the steady and high-latitude unidentified sources in the

from 2x10^32 erg/s to 5x10^34 erg/s. We positively detect GS 2023+338. Its
X-ray spectrum can be fit by a power law (photon index Gamma=1.9) or a thermal
bremsstrahlung (with kT= 7$ keV), converting in both cases to a 1-10 keV
unabsorbed luminosity of ~10^33 erg/s. These values are comparable to the ones
derived during an ASCA observation in 1994, indicating that the source remains
stable over a ~5 yr baseline.

  workshop (Alicante)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The detection of 1.809 MeV gamma-ray line emission from the Cygnus X complex
by the COMPTEL telescope is one of the most convincing proves of massive star
nucleosynthesis in our Galaxy. The Cygnus X complex is an extremely active
nearby region, containing several star forming regions, OB associations and
young open star clusters. It houses some of the most massive stars known in our
Galaxy and concentrates a large number of Wolf-Rayet stars. Thermal radio
continuum emission and intense [C II] line emission reveals widespread
ionisation, and at least 60 individual H II regions have been identified. In
order to understand the 1.809 MeV gamma-ray line emission from the Cygnus X
complex, and to compare the observations to theoretical nucleosynthesis
calculations, we modelled the multi-wavelength spectrum of the region by means
of an evolutionary synthesis model. Our investigation leads us to the following
conclusions: 1. Stellar wind ejection is the dominant mechanism for the
observed 26Al enrichment in the Cygnus X region. 2. Cyg OB2 is by far the
dominating massive star association in Cygnus X and 1.809 MeV line emission
from 26Al produced in this association should be detectable by the spectrometer
SPI on INTEGRAL. 3. There is only low supernova activity in the Cygnus X
complex and the 60Fe lines should be below INTEGRAL's detection sensitivity.
The detectability of an individual massive star cluster (Cyg OB2) by INTEGRAL
provides a fantastic opportunity for future nucleosynthesis studies using
gamma-ray line spectroscopy. We will explore the scientific potential of such
observations, and provide estimates for gamma-ray line intensity distributions
based on the massive star census of the Cygnus X region.

also enhanced. In contrast, the ICM in non-cD clusters appears to be isothermal
with little metallicity gradient right to the center. The gravitational
potential exhibits a hierarchical nesting around cD galaxies, while a total
mass-density profile with a central cusp is indicated for a non-cD cluster
Abell~1060. The iron-mass-to-light ratio of the ICM decreases toward the center
in both types of clusters, although it is radially constant in peripheral
regions. The silicon-to-iron abundance ratio in the ICM increases with the
cluster richness, but remains close to the solar ratio around cD galaxies.

jet. As the sideways expansion of the jet becomes significant, most of the
optical radiation from the high-latitude part of the jet may be absorbed by the

the part within the initial solid angle can be observed. We analytically show
that the flux of the observational radiation decays as $\propto t^{-(p+1)}$

relativistic phase. This preliminary result motivates us to perform numerical
calculations. Our results show that one break in the optical afterglow ligh

larger than the seeing, and (iii) it has an observed central brightness of
about mu_B = 20 mag arcsec^{-2}, intermediate between those of elliptical
galaxies (on the bright mu_B side) and normal low-luminosity dwarf irregular
(on the low mu_B side) galaxies. No other known galaxy exhibits all these

normal distant luminous elliptical galaxy, since the fundamental plane tells us
that higher luminosity normal elliptical galaxies tend to have lower
surface-brightnesses. Markarian 1460 has 2 X 10^7 M_sun of HI and a ratio
M(HI)/L_B of 0.2, which is low compared to typical values for star-forming

registration of the 22 GHz continuum emission and the location of the maser
spots with an accuracy of ~ 5 mas. Within the monitoring data, we find evidence
that the nuclear masers vary coherently on time-scales of months to years, much
more rapidly than the dynamical time-scale. We argue that the nuclear masers
are responding in reverberation to a central power source, presumably the
central engine. Between October and November 1997, we detected a simultaneous
flare of the blue-shifted and red-shifted satellite maser lines. Reverberation
in a rotating disk naturally explains the simultaneous flaring. There is also
evidence that near-infrared emission from dust grains associated with the maser
disk also responds to the central engine. We present a model in which an X-ray
flare results in both the loss of maser signal in 1990 and the peak of the
near-infrared light curve in 1994. In support of a rotating disk geometry for
the nuclear masers, we find no evidence for centripetal accelerations of the
redshifted nuclear masers; the limits are +/- 0.006 km/s/year, implying that
the masers are located within 2 degrees of the kinematic line-of-nodes. We also
searched for high velocity maser emission like that observed in NGC 4258. In
both VLA and Effelsberg spectra, we detect no high velocity lines between +/-

equivalent to the tetradic Green's function formalism. It provides however a
direct route to derive particular forms of the Liouville equation applicable in

intrigued people for some time now [1]. These vortices either extend from wall
to wall, however tangled they may be in between, or else can be roughly
circular and freely move around the superfluid [1]. Some time ago, Richard
Feynman postulated that two oppositely polarized line vortices could, if they
cross at two points, reconnect so as to create a circular vortex that snaps off
and subsequently lives a life of its own [2]. This is often simply postulated
in numerical experiments, e.g. [1], [3]. That an opposite line vortex pair
solution of the Nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS) for HeII is unstable has
been demonstrated theoretically [4]. Reconnection at a point has been obtained
numerically [5]. What remained to prove was that known, stationary, double
vortex line solutions can thus reproduce one of the one parameter solitonic
family of solutions for circular vortices as found for NLS [6]. In other words,
can this reconnection really lead to a full confirmation of Feynman's
hypothesis? Our first step was a similar changeover calculation for a limiting
case, unfortunately such that the vortex configuration was degenerate [7], [8].
However, surprisingly complete dynamic changeover from cylindrical to spherical
symmetry of the soliton was observed in [7]. This augured well for the present
effort.

shock-waves up to the point of evolution at which the forward light-cone of a
collision meets the boundary of the space-time. The conclusions are quite
general and in particular generalize the previous work of E. and H. Verlinde.
The role of the off-diagonal Einstein action in removing the bulk part of the
action is emphasised. We discuss the sense in which our result is a particular
example of holography and also the relation of our solutions in $AdS$ to those
of Horowitz and Itzhaki.

fluctuations in bead packs [Coppersmith et al (1996)], a stochastic model to
simulate the stress of granular media in two dimensional silos. The vertical
coordinate plays the role of time, and the horizontal coordinate the role of
space. The process is a discrete time Markov process with state space
$\R^{\{1,...,N\}}$. At each layer (time), the weight supported by each grain is
a random variable of mean one (its own weight) plus the sum of random fractions
of the weights supported by the nearest neighboring grains at the previous
layer. The fraction of the weight given to the right neighbor of the successive
layer is a uniform random variable in $[0,1]$ independent of everything. The
remaining weight is given to the left neighbor. In the boundaries, a uniform
fraction of the weight leans on the wall of the silo. This corresponds to
\emph{absorbing boundary conditions}. For this model we show that there exists
a unique invariant measure. The mean weight at site $i$ under the invariant
measure is $i(N+1-i)$; we prove that its variance is $\frac12(i(N+1-i))^2 +
O(N^3)$ and the covariances between grains $i\neq j$ are of order $O(N^3)$.
Moreover, as $N\to\infty$, the law under the invariant measure of the weights
divided by $N^2$ around site (integer part of) $rN$, $r\in (0,1)$, converges to
a product of gamma distributions with parameters 2 and $2(r(1-r))^{-1}$ (sum of
two exponentials of mean $r(1-r)/2$). Liu {\it et al} (1995) proved that for a
silo with infinitely many weightless grains, any product of gamma distributions
with parameters 2 and $2/\rho$ with $\rho\in [0,\infty)$ are invariant. Our
result shows that as the silo grows, the model selects exactly one of these
Gamma's at each macroscopic place.

85Rb and 87Rb to ascertain the nature of their spinor Bose-Einstein
condensates. These calculations predict that the spinor condensate for the
spin-1 boson 87Rb has a ferromagnetic nature. The spinor condensates for the
spin-2 bosons 85Rb and 87Rb, however, are both predicted to be polar. The
nature of a spin-1 condensate hinges critically on the sign of the difference
between the s-wave scattering lengths for total spin 0 and 2 while the nature
of a spin-2 condensate depends on the values of the differences between s-wave
scattering lengths for the total spin 0, 2 and 4. These scattering lengths were
extracted previously and found to have overlapping uncertainties for all three
cases, thus leaving the nature of the spinor condensates ambiguous. The present
study exploits a refined uncertainty analysis of the scattering lengths based
on recently improved result from experimental work by Roberts et al., which
permits us to extract an unambiguous result for the nature of the ground state
spinor condensates.

study of the ``designability problem'', the phenomenon in which most of the
about 16,000 proteins of known structure have their native conformations
concentrated in a relatively small number of about 500 topological classes of
conformations. Here it is shown that on a lattice the most highly designable
simulated protein structures are those that have the largest number of
surface-core switchbacks. A combination of physical, mathematical and
biological reasons that causes the phenomenon is given. By comparing the most
foldable model peptides with protein sequences in the Protein Data Bank, it is
shown that whereas different models may yield similar designabilities,
predicted foldable peptides will simulate natural proteins only when the model
incorporates the correct physics and biology, in this case if the main folding
force arises from the differing hydrophobicity of the residues, but does not
originate, say, from the steric hindrance effect caused by the differing sizes
of the residues.

fundamental level using a manifestly covariant proper time procedure. We
formulate equations of motion and continuity (and constitutive equations) that
are the starting point for any calculations regarding continuous media. In the
force free limit, the standard relativistic equations are regained, so that
these equations can be regarded as a generalization of the standard procedure.
In the case of an inviscid fluid we derive an analogue of the Bernoulli
equations. For irrotational flow we prove that the velocity field can be
derived from a potential. If, in addition, the fluid is incompressible, the
potential must obey the d'Alembert equation, and thus the problem is reduced to
solving the d'Alembert equation with specific boundary conditions (in both
space and time). The solutions indicate the existence of light velocity sound
waves in an incompressible fluid (a result known from previous literature
[19]). Relaxing the constraints and allowing the fluid to become linearly
compressible, one can derive a wave equation from which the sound velosity can
again be computed. For a stationary background flow, it has been demonstrated
that the sound velocity attains its corrrect values for the incompressible and
non-relatvistic limits. Finally, viscosity is introduced, bulk and shear
viscosity constants are defined, and we formulate equations for the motion of a
viscous fluid.
