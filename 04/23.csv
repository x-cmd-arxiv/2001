starburst site in which an intense episode of star formation occurred over 100
Myr ago, which is now confirmed by our derived age distribution. It suggests
steady, continuing cluster formation at a modest rate at early times (> 2 Gyr
ago), followed by a concentrated formation episode ~600 Myr ago and more recent
suppression of cluster formation. The peak episode coincides with independent
dynamical estimates for the last tidal encounter with M81.

from a turbulent, Keplerian disk that is intended to represent the sub-parsec
disk at the nucleus of the galaxy NGC4258. The polarization in the calculations
is a result of the Zeeman effect in the regime in which the Zeeman splitting is
much less than the spectral linebreadth. Plausible configurations for turbulent
magnetic and velocity fields in the disk are created by statistical methods.
This turbulence, along with the Keplerian velocity gradients and the blending
of the three hyperfine components to form the $6_{16} - 5_{23}$ masing
transition of water, are key ingredients in determining the appearance of the
polarized spectra that are calculated. These spectra are quite different from
the polarized spectra that would be expected for a two-level transition where
there is no hyperfine structure. The effect of the hyperfine structure on the
polarization is most striking in the calculations for the maser emission that
represents the central (or systemic) features of NGC4258. Information about
magnetic fields is inferred from observations for polarized maser radiation and
bears on the structure of accretion disks.

galaxies and dark halos in spatially flat low-density CDM universe using
cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We compare their biasing properties with
the predictions of an analytic halo biasing model. Dark halos in our
simulations exhibit reasonable agreement with the predictions only on scales
larger than 10h^{-1}Mpc, and on smaller scales the volume exclusion effect of
halos due to their finite size becomes substantial. Interestingly the biasing
properties of galaxies are better described by extrapolating the halo biasing
model predictions.
  We also find the clear dependence of galaxy biasing on their formation epoch;
the distribution of old populations of galaxies tightly correlates with the
underlying mass density field, while that of young populations is slightly more
stochastic and anti-biased relative to dark matter. The amplitude of two-point
correlation function of old populations is about 3 times larger than that of
the young populations. Furthermore, the old population of galaxies reside
within massive dark halos while the young galaxies are preferentially formed in
smaller dark halos. Assuming that the observed early and late-type galaxies
correspond to the simulated old and young populations of galaxies,
respectively, all of these segregations of galaxies are consistent with
observational ones for the early and late-type of galaxies such as the
morphology--density relation of galaxies.

surpassed by GRB990123. In terms of the isotropic 20-2000 keV energy output of
7.8E53 erg, it ranks third of all GRBs with measured distances. Since this

history shows clear signs of a break which is consistent with a break seen in
the optical, and provides supporting evidence for the achromatic nature of the
break. An explanation for the break in the context of a collimated expansion is
not straightforward. Rather, a model is favored whereby the fireball is braked
to the non-relativistic regime quickly (within a fraction of day) by a dense

at the Vainu Bappu Observatory, Kavalur, beginning ~ 0.6 day after the
detection of the event. The results based on these photometric observations
combined with others reported in the literature are presented in this paper.
The R band light curve shows an initial decline of intensities proportional to
t^{-0.542} which steepens, after 10.3 hours, to t^{-1.263}. Following the model
of collimated outflow, the early break in the light curve implies a very narrow
beam angle (~ 2-3 deg). The two decay rates are consistent with the standard
jet model in a uniform density ambient medium, but require a hard spectrum of
electron power density with p ~ 1.5. The R band light between 14 and 17 hours
since outburst departs from the power law fit by 0.1 mag and shows some
evidence for fluctuations over timescales of an hour in the observer's frame.
Such deviations are expected due to density inhomogeneities if the ambient
medium is similar to the local interstellar medium. GRB 010222 is thus an
example of a highly collimated outflow with a hard spectrum of electron energy
distribution in normal interstellar environment.

the COBE, Saskatoon and MAX data sets. We examine in detail the ability of
certain approximate techniques based on band-power estimates to recover the
full likelihood constraints. The traditional $\chi^2$-method does not always
find the same best-fit model as the likelihood analysis (a bias), due mainly to
the false assumption of Gaussian likelihoods that makes the method overly
sensitive to data outliers. Although an improvement, other approaches employing
non-Gaussian flat-band likelihoods do not always faithfully reproduce the
complete likelihood constraints either; not even when using the exact flat-band
likelihood curves. We trace this to the neglect of spectral information by
simple flat band-power estimates. A straightforward extension incorporating a
local effective slope (of the power spectrum, $C_l$) provides a faithful
representation of the likelihood surfaces without significantly increasing
computing cost. Finally, we also demonstrate that the best-fit model to this
particular data set is a {\em good fit}, or that the observations are
consistent with Gaussian sky fluctuations, according to our statistic.

fitted by a Comptonization of soft photons by moderately hot electrons (kT ~0.9

are consistent with black body emission from the accretion disk at the
magnetospheric radius. Another possibility is to fit the soft excess with black
body and thermal bremsstrahlung. In this case the black body would originate
from cold plasma at the magnetosphere while the bremsstrahlung component may be
produced by the strong stellar wind from the companion star, ionized by the

geometrical dependencies, and the spectra of SS just above the onset were
measured. They were found to be in a good quantitative agreement with the
theory. (ii) It was shown that the mechanism of SS amplitude saturation is due
to the nonlinear attenuation of SS via three wave interactions between the SS
waves. Strong low frequency amplitude fluctuations of SS above the threshold
were observed. The spectra of these fluctuations had a universal shape with
exponentially decaying tails. Furthermore, the spectral width grew continuously

repulsion between bosons, in which at T=0, along with a weak single-particle
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), there exists an intensive pair coherent
condensate (PCC), analogous to the Cooper condensate in a Fermi liquid with an
attraction between the fermions. Such a PCC emerges in a system of bosons due
to an oscillating sign-changing momentum dependence of the Fourier component of
the pair interaction potential, which is characteristic of a certain family of
repulsion potentials. In such cases, the Fourier component is negative in some
domain of nonzero momentum transfer, which corresponds to an effective
attraction. The collective effects of renormalization (``screening'') of the
initial interaction lead to a suppression of the repulsion and an enhancement
of the effective attraction. It is the ratio of the BEC density to the full
density of the liquid $n_0/n\ll 1$ that is used as a small parameter---unlike
in the Bogolyubov theory for a quasi-ideal Bose gas, in which the small
parameter is the ratio of the number of supracondensate excitations to the
number of particles in an intensive BEC, $(n-n_0)/n_0\ll 1$. A closed system of
nonlinear integral equations for the normal and anomalous self-energy parts is

due to a mutual destruction of the quasiclassical localization induced by a

long-range Gaussian disorder is washed out by the scattering on hard discs,
whereas the adiabatic drift and related percolation of cyclotron orbits
destroys the localization in the dilute system of hard discs. For intermediate

  Proc Vol 677, V. Bulatov et al ed, 66-71 (2001)",,,"cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  Waves propagate through disordered systems in a variety of regimes. There is
a threshold of disorder beyond which waves become localized and transport
becomes restricted. The intensity I of the wave transmitted through a system
has a dependence on the length L of the sample that is characteristic of the
regime. For example, I decays as 1/L in the diffusive regime. It is of current
interest to characterize the transport regime of a wave from statistical
studies of the transmittance quantities through it. Studies suggest that the
probability distribution of the intensity could be used to characterize the
localized regime. There is an ongoing debate on what deviations from the
classical Rayleigh distribution are to be expected. In this numerical work, we
use scalar waves to obtain the intensity, transmission, and conductance of
waves through a disordered system. We calculate the intensity, by setting an
incoming plane wave towards the sample from a fixed direction. The outgoing
intensity is then calculated at one point in space. This process is repeated
for a collection of samples belonging to the same ensemble that characterizes
the disorder, and we construct the probability distribution of the intensity.
In the case of transmission, we evaluate the field arriving to a series of
points distributed in the far field, and repeat the same statistical analysis.
For the conductance, we calculate the field at the same series of points for
incoming waves in different directions. We analyze the distribution of the
transmittance quantities and their change with the degree of disorder.

observed substantial shift of the glass transition temperature, Tg, of

weight, where geometrical `finite size' effects on the chain conformation can
be ruled out. The model is based on the idea that the polymer freezes due to
memory effects in the viscoelastic eigenmodes of the film, which are affected
by the proximity of the boundaries. The elastic modulus of the polymer at the
glass transition turns out to be the only fitting parameter. Quantitative
agreement is obtained with our experimental results on short chain polystyrene
(Mw = 2 kg/mol), as well as with earlier results obtained with larger
molecules. Furthermore, the model naturally accounts for the weak dependence of
the shift of Tg upon the molecular weight. It furthermore explains why
supported films must be thinner than free standing ones to yield the same
shift, and why the latter depends upon the chemical properties of the
substrate. Generalizations for arbitrary experimental geometries are
straightforward.

a numerical algorithm based on a pure rotational dynamics of the director field

that the total light transmission versus time is not affected by the presence

pretilt angles at the surfaces are sufficiently small, the twisting sense of
one species of helices is reversed and a configuration free of defects occurs.

supplemented with the (anti-) self-dual Pontrjagin term is carried out. The
effect of the topological term is to add a `magnetic' term to the original
momentum variable associated with the self-dual action leaving the Ashtekar
connection unmodified. In the new variables, the Gauss constraint retains its
form, while both vector and Hamiltonian constraints are modified. This shows,
the contribution of the Euler and Pontrjagin terms is not the same as that
coming from the term associated with the Barbero-Immirzi parameter, and thus
the analogy between the theta-angle in Yang-Mills theory and the
Barbero-Immirzi parameter of gravity is not appropriate.

to gravity. Geometrically, these scalars represent the very coordinates of

a given metric field configuration which becomes the vacuum of the theory.
Kaluza-Klein theories of the kind have been shown to be free of the classical
cosmological constant problem, and to give massless gauge fields after
dimensional reduction. In this paper, the consistency of dimensional reduction,
as well as the stability of the internal excitations, are analyzed. Choosing
the internal space in the form of a group manifold, one meets no
inconsistencies in the dimensional reduction procedure. As an example, the
SO(n) groups are analyzed, with the result that the mass matrix of the internal
excitations necessarily possesses negative modes. In the case of coset spaces,
the consistency of dimensional reduction rules out all but the stable mode,
although the full vacuum stability remains an open problem.

electroweak symmetry breaking in the TeV range. At these energies the Standard
Model (SM) predictions have to be known precisely in order to disentangle
various viable scenarios such as supersymmetry and its manifestations. In
particular, large logarithmic corrections of the scale ratio $\sqrt{s}/M$,
where $M$ denotes the gauge boson masses, contribute significantly up to and
including the two loop level.
  In this paper we review recent progress in the theoretical understanding of
the electroweak Sudakov corrections at high energies up to subleading accuracy
in the SM and the minimal supersymmetric SM (MSSM). We discuss the symmetric
part of the SM Lagrangian at high energies yielding the effective theory
employed in the framework of the infrared evolution equation (IREE) method.
Applications are presented for important SM and MSSM processes relevant for the
physics program of future linear colliders including higher order purely
electroweak angular dependent corrections.
  The size of the higher order subleading electroweak corrections is found to
change cross sections in the several percent regime at TeV energies and their
inclusion is thus mandatory for predictions of high energy processes at future
colliders.

disturbances (LS TIDs) during the maximum phase of a strong magnetic storm of
6-8 April 2000 are shown. Total electron content (TEC) variations were studied
by using data from GPS receivers located in Russia and Central Asia. The
nightglow response to this storm at mesopause and termospheric altitudes was
also measured by optical instruments FENIX located at the observatory of the
Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics, (51.9 deg. N, 103.0 deg. E) and MORTI
located at the observatory of the Institute of Ionosphere (43.2 deg. N, 77.0
deg. E). Observations of the O (557.7 nm, 630.0 nm, 360-410 nm, and 720-830 nm)
emissions originating from atmospheric layers centered at altitudes of 90 km,
97 km, and 250 km were carried out at Irkutsk and of the O_2 (866.5 nm)
emission originating from an atmospheric layer centered at altitude of 95 km
was carried out at Almaty. Variations of the f_0F2 and virtual altitude of the
F2 layer were measured at Almaty as well. An analysis of data was performed for
the time interval 17.00-21.00 UT comprising a maximum of the Dst derivative.
Results have shown that the storm-induced solitary large-scale wave with
duration of 1 hour and with the front width of 5000 km moved equatorward with
the velocity of 200 ms-1 to a distance of no less than 1000 km. The TEC
disturbance, basically displaying an electron content depression in the maximum
of the F2 region, reveals a good correlation with growing nightglow emission,
the temporal shift between the TEC and emission variation maxima being
different for different altitudes.

relativistic density functional method was applied to account for a proper
description of the strong relativistic effects. A limited number of atoms in
the framework of a cluster approach is used to describe the surface. Different
adsorption sites are investigated. We found that CO is preferably adsorbed at

  flows","12 pages, latex, to be published in Geophys. Astrophys. Fluid
  Dynamics",,"10.1080/03091920108203409",,"physics.plasm-ph",,"  It is found that the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium of an axisymmetric
gravitating magnetically confined plasma with incompressible flows is governed
by a second-order elliptic differential equation for the poloidal magnetic flux
function containing five flux functions coupled with a Poisson equation for the
gravitation potential, and an algebraic relation for the pressure. This set of
equations is amenable to analytic solutions. As an application, the
magnetic-dipole static axisymmetric equilibria with vanishing poloidal plasma
currents derived recently by Krasheninnikov, Catto, and Hazeltine [Phys. Rev.
Lett. {\bf 82}, 2689 (1999)] are extended to plasmas with finite poloidal
currents, subject to gravitating forces from a massive body (a star or black
hole) and inertial forces due to incompressible sheared flows. Explicit
solutions are obtained in two regimes: (a) in the low-energy regime
$\beta_0\approx \gamma_0\approx \delta_0 \approx\epsilon_0\ll 1$, where
$\beta_0$, $\gamma_0$, $\delta_0$, and $\epsilon_0$ are related to the thermal,
poloidal-current, flow and gravitating energies normalized to the
poloidal-magnetic-field energy, respectively, and (b) in the high-energy regime
$\beta_0\approx \gamma_0\approx \delta_0 \approx\epsilon_0\gg 1$. It turns out
that in the high-energy regime all four forces, pressure-gradient,
toroidal-magnetic-field, inertial, and gravitating contribute equally to the
formation of magnetic surfaces very extended and localized about the symmetry
plane such that the resulting equilibria resemble the accretion disks in
astrophysics.

fundamental laws is explained. This explanation shows that the Little-Parks
oscillations of the loop resistance are an experimental evidence of a direct
(non-chaotic) Brownian motion. The Langevin force is connected with a change of
the momentum circulation of superconducting pairs because of the quantization.
Its average value can be non-zero because of the quantization. The existence of
a direct Brownian motion contradicts to the principle on which the second law
of thermodynamic is based. Therefore the Little-Parks experiment is evidence of
a possibility of violation of the second law. In the last years other authors
have stated also violation of the second law in different quantum systems:

split on a beam splitter into the same entanglement that is produced when two
squeezed beams are mixed orthogonally. We demonstrate that this technique can
in principle facilitate perfect teleportation utilising only one squeezed beam.
