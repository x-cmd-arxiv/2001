gravitationally lensed QSOs (UM 673, Q1104-1804, and Q1422+2309). We studied
the velocity and column density differences in CIV doublets in each QSO. Unlike
the low ionization gas clouds typical of the interstellar gas in the Galaxy or
damped Ly alpha galaxies, the spatial density distribution of CIV absorbing gas
clouds turns out to be mostly featureless on scales up to a few hundred
parsecs, with column density differences rising to 50 percent or more over
separations beyond a few kpc. Similarly, velocity shear becomes detectable only
over distances larger than a few hundred pc, rising to 70 km/s at a few kpc.
The energy transmitted to the gas is substantially less than in present day
star-forming regions, and the gas is less turbulent on a given spatial scale
than, e.g., local HII regions. The quiescence of CIV clouds, taken with their
probable low density, imply that these objects are not internal to galaxies.
The CIV absorbers could be gas expelled recently to large radii and raining
back onto its parent galaxy, or pre-enriched gas from an earlier (population
III) episode of star formation, falling into the nearest mass concentration.
However, while the metals in the gas may have been formed at higher redshifts,
the residual turbulence in the clouds and the minimum coherence length measured
here imply that the gas was stirred more recently, possibly by star formation
events recurring on a timescale on the order of 10-100 Million years (abstract
abbreviated).

white dwarfs (WD). We present the first study of multi-dimensional effects
during the final hours prior to the thermonuclear runaway which leads to the
explosion. The calculations utilize an implicit, 2-D hydro code.Mixing and the
ignition process are studied in detail. We find that the initial chemical
structure of the WD is changed but the material is not fully homogenized. The
exploding WD sustains a central region with a low C/O ratio. This implies that
the explosive nuclear burning will begin in a partially C-depleted environment.
The thermonuclear runaway happens in a well defined region close to the center.
It is induced by compressional heat when matter is brought inwards by
convective flows. We find no evidence for multiple spot or strong off-center
ignition. Convective velocities are of the order of 100 km/sec which is well
above the effective burning speeds in SNe Ia previously expected right after
the runaway. For about 0.5 to 1 sec, the speed of the burning front will
neither be determined by the laminar speed nor the Rayleigh-Taylor
instabilities but by convective flows produced prior to the runaway. The
consequences are discussed for our under- standing of the detailed physics of
the flame propagation, the deflagration detonation transition, and the
nucleosynthesis in the central layers. Our results strongly suggest the
pre-conditioning of the progenitor as a key-factor for our understanding of the

determining the line-of-sight (LOS) depth of the SMC using these clusters as

highest quality data for which the ages and abundances are best known and can
be placed on an internally consistent scale. We have analyzed the variation of
the clusters' properties with position on the sky and with line-of-sight depth.
Based on this analysis, we draw the following conclusions. 1) The observational
data indicates that the eastern side of the SMC (facing the LMC) contains
younger and more metal-rich clusters as compared with the western side. This is
not a strong correlation because our dataset of clusters is necessarily
limited, but it is suggestive and warrants further study. 2) Depending on how
the reddening is computed to our clusters, we find a mean distance modulus that
ranges from (m-M)_0 = 18.71 +/- 0.06 to (m-M)_0 = 18.82 +/- 0.05. 3) The
intrinsic +/- 1-sigma line-of-sight depth of the SMC populous clusters in our
study is between ~6 kpc and ~12 kpc depending primarily on whether we adopt the
Burstein & Heiles reddenings or those from Schlegel et al. 4) Viewing the SMC
as a triaxial galaxy with the Declination, Right Ascension, and LOS depth as
the three axes, we find axial ratios of approximately 1:2:4. Taken together,
these conclusions largely agree with those of previous investigators and serve
to underscore the utility of populous star clusters as probes of the structure

imply that these sources are radio-silent. We also review claimed associations

assembled by super-sonic turbulent flows in molecular clouds. Self-gravitating
cores are selected from a three dimensional simulation of super-sonic and
super-Alfvenic magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. The polarization is
computed in two ways. In model A it is assumed that dust properties and grain
alignment efficiency are uniform; in model B it is assumed that grains are not
aligned at visual extinction larger than 3 mag. The main results of this work
are: i) Values of the degree of polarization P between 1 and 10% are typical,
despite the super-Alfvenic nature of the turbulence; ii) A steep decrease of P
with increasing values of the sub-mm dust continuum intensity I is always found
in self--gravitating cores selected from the MHD simulations, if grains are not
aligned above a certain value of visual extinction (model B); iii) The same
behavior is hard to reproduce if grains are aligned independently of visual
extinction (model A); iv) The Chandrasekhar-Fermi formula, corrected by a
factor f=0.4, provides an approximate estimate of the average magnetic field
strength in the cores. Sub-mm dust continuum polarization maps of quiescent
protostellar cores and Bok globules always show a decrease in P with increasing
value of I consistent with the predictions of our model B. We therefore
conclude that sub-mm polarization maps of quiescent cores do not map the
magnetic field inside the cores at visual extinction larger than approximately
3 mag. There is no inconsistency between the results from optical and near-IR
polarized absorption of background stars, and the observed polarization of
sub-mm dust continuum from quiescent cores. In both cases, grains at large
visual extinction appear to be virtually unaligned.

Compton and adiabatic energy losses and gains we evolved the relativistic
electron population to produce synthetic polarisation radio maps. On contact
with the shock wave the radio cocoons are first compressed and finally torn
into filamentary structures, as is observed in several cluster radio relics. In
the synthetic radio maps the electric polarisation vectors are mostly
perpendicular to the filamentary radio structures. If the magnetic field inside
the cocoon is not too strong, the initially spherical radio cocoon is
transformed into a torus after the passage of the shock wave. Very recent,
high-resolution radio maps of cluster radio relics seem to exhibit such
toroidal geometries in some cases. This supports the hypothesis that cluster
radio relics are fossil radio cocoons that have been revived by a shock wave.
For a late-stage relic the ratio of its global diameter to the filament
diameter should correlate with the shock strength. Finally, we argue that the
total radio polarisation of radio relic should be well correlated with the
3-dimensional orientation of the shock wave that produced the relic.

absorption line data towards epsilon CMa, and EUV opacity measurements of
nearby white dwarf stars. Including the radiation from the conductive boundary
improves agreement with data on the temperature and electron density in the

necessary to maintain the heating/cooling balance and reach the observed
temperature. Using the column density observations as inputs, we derive the gas
phase abundances of C, N, O, Mg, Si, S and Fe. Based on these inferred

attractive pairing-interaction for oppositely polarized spins. Since a magnetic

occurs or the phonon modes are highly anisotropic. We identified a
doubly-degenerate quasi-two dimensional key-energy band in the vicinity of
$E_{F}$ along $\Gamma$-A direction of BZ which play an important role in
deciding the superconducting behavior of this material. Based on this result,

resistance is explained as result of activation of localized electrons to
conductance band leading to a suppression of non-linear screening of the
disorder potential. The magnetoresistance (MR) in the critical region is
related to depopulation of double occupied localized states also leading to
partial suppression of the nonlinear screening. The most informative data are
related to nearly activated temperature dependence of MR in strongly insulating
limit (which can be in particular reached from the metallic state in high
enough fields). According to our model this behavior originates due to a
lowering of a position of chemical potential in the upper Hubbard band due to
Zeeman splitting. We compare the theoretical predictions to the existing
experimental data and demonstrate that the model explains such features of the
2D MIT as scaling behavior in the critical region, saturation of MR and H/T
scaling of MR in the insulating limit. The quantitative analysis of MR in

concurrent acoustic emission by the analysis of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.
Two quantized vortices reconnect following the process similar to classical
vortices; they approach, twist themselves locally so that they become
anti-parallel at the closest place, reconnect and leave separately.The
investigation of the motion of the singular lines where the amplitude of the
wave function vanishes in the vortex cores confirms that they follow the above
scenario by reconnecting at a point. This reconnection is not contradictory to
the Kelvin's circulation theorem, because the potential of the superflow field
becomes undefined at the reconnection point. When the locally anti-parallel
part of the vortices becomes closer than the healing length, it moves with the
velocity comparable to the sound velocity, emits the sound waves and leads to
the pair annihilation or reconnection; this phenomena is concerned with the
Cherenkov resonance. The vortices are broken up to smaller vortex loops through
a series of reconnection, eventually disappearing with the acoustic emission.
This may correspond to the final stage of the vortex cascade process proposed
by Feynman. The change in energy components, such as the quantum, the
compressible and incompressible kinetic energy is analyzed for each dynamics.
The propagation of the sound waves not only appears in the profile of the
amplitude of the wave function but also affects the field of its phase,
transforming the quantum energy due to the vortex cores to the kinetic energy
of the phase field.

expected due to an additional collinear enhancement (arise due to decrease in
thermal quark mass) as compared to it's equilibrium counterpart. Interestingly,
unlike the one loop case, the reduction in the two loop processes are found to
be independent of gluon chemical poential, but strongly depends on quark
fugacity. It is also found that, since the phase space suppression is highest
for annihilation with scattering, the photon production is entirely dominated
by bremsstrahlung mechanism at all energies. This is to be contrasted with the
case of the equilibrated plasma where annihilation with scattering dominates

are generalized for odd primitive roots of unity to all vertex models

representation independent methods which only take the algebraic structure of

arbitrary Kac-Moody algebra. Employing the notion of the boost operator it is

the single-layer 2D barotropic flow model and the continuously stratified, 3D
baroclinic flow model. This model is widely used to investigate basic
mechanisms in geophysical flows, such as baroclinic effects, the Gulf Stream
and subtropical gyres. The wind forcing acts only on the top layer. We consider
the two-layer quasigeostrophic model under stochastic wind forcing. We first
transformed this system into a coupled system of random partial differential
equations and then show that the asymptotic probabilistic dynamics of this
system depends only on the top fluid layer. Namely, in the probability sense
and asymptotically, the dynamics of the two-layer quasigeostrophic fluid system
is determinied by the top fluid layer, or, the bottom fluid layer is slaved by
the top fluid layer.
  This conclusion is true provided that the Wiener process and the fluid
parameters satisfy a certain condition. In particular, this latter condition is
satisfied when the trace of the covariance operator of the Wiener process is
controled by a certain upper bound, and the Ekman constant $r$ is sufficiently
large. Note that the generalized time derivative of the Wiener process models
the fluctuating part of the wind stress forcing on the top fluid layer, and the
Ekman constant $r$ measures the rate for vorticity decay due to the friction in
the bottom Ekman layer.

crucial test of our predictions. The dominant contributions are found to be

protons and paired neutrons and interacting among themselves through monopole
particle-hole and monopole particle-particle interactions is used to study the
double beta decay of Fermi type. The states are described by time dependent
approaches choosing as trial functions coherent states of the symmetry groups
underlying the model Hamiltonian. One formalism, VP1, is fully equivalent with
the standard pnQRPA and therefore fails at a critical value of the
particle-particle interaction strength while another one, VP2, corresponds to a
two step BCS treatment, i.e. the proton quasiparticles are paired with the
neutron quasiparticles. In this way a harmonic description for the double beta
transition amplitude is provided for any strength of the particle-particle
interaction. The approximation quality is judged by comparing the actual
results with the exact result as well as with those corresponding to various
truncations of the boson expanded Hamiltonian and transition operator. Finally
it is shown that the dynamic ground states provided by VP1 and VP2 are
reasonable well approximated by solutions of a variational principle. This
remark constitutes a step forward finding an approach where the RPA ground
state is a solution of a variational principle equation.

equilibrium at the hidden-variable level, such that nonlocality is masked by
quantum noise. To account for this 'quantum equilibrium', we outline a
subquantum statistical mechanics in configuration space, and an H-theorem
analogous to the classical coarse-graining H-theorem. Foundational issues in
statistical mechanics are addressed, and an alternative explanation based on
'typicality' is criticised. An estimate is given for the relaxation timescale,
and an illustrative numerical simulation is provided. Assuming the universe
began in quantum non-equilibrium, we sketch a scenario in which relaxation is
suppressed at very early times by the rapid expansion of space, raising the
possibility that deviations from quantum theory could survive to the present
day for relic cosmological particles that decoupled sufficiently early. It is
concluded that quantum noise is a remnant of the big bang and, like the
microwave background, should be probed experimentally. Possible tests with
relic particles are briefly discussed.

probability in one of two non-orthogonal entangled states of multipartite
distributed among separated parties. We demonstrate that these two states can
be optimally distinguished in the sense of conclusive discrimination by local
operations and classical communications(LOCC) alone. And this proves strictly
the conjecture that Virmani et.al. [8] confirmed numerically and analytically.
Generally, the optimal protocol requires local POVM operations which are
explicitly constructed. The result manifests that the distinguishable
information is obtained only and completely at the last operation and all prior
ones give no information about that state.
