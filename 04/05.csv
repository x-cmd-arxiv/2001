galaxies in the Virgo cluster using spectra of very high S/N ratio for six
elliptical galaxies selected along the CMR. The data are analysed using a new
evolutionary stellar population synthesis model to generate galaxy spectra at
the resolution given by their velocity dispersions. In particular we use a new
age indicator that is virtually free of the effects of metallicity. We find
that the luminosity weighted mean ages of Virgo ellipticals are greater than ~8
Gyr, and show no clear trend with galaxy luminosity. We also find a positive
correlation of metallicity with luminosity, colour and velocity dispersion. We
conclude that the CMR is driven primarily by a luminosity-metallicity
correlation. However, not all elements increase equally with the total
metallicity and we speculate that the CMR may be driven by both a total
metallicity increase and by a systematic departure from solar abundance ratios
of some elements along the CMR. A full understanding of the role played by the
total metallicity, abundance ratios and age in generating the CMR requires the
analysis of spectra of very high quality, such as those reported here, for a
larger number of galaxies in Virgo and other clusters.

presence of a >1 solar mass of iron rich material in the close vicinity of the

observed less than a day after the trigger strongly limits the size of the

nickel and cobalt have not yet decayed into iron. We show how to solve this

fraction of the central energetics, or strong tidal interaction, and to have
normal infrared luminosities. These observations were obtained with ISOCAM,
which provides an angular resolution of the order of 10 arcsec (half-power
diameter of the point spread function) and low-resolution spectro-imaging
information. Between 5 and 18 microns, we mainly observe two dust phases,
aromatic infrared bands and very small grains, both out of thermal equilibrium.
On this sample, we show that the global F15/F7 colors of galaxies are very
uniform, the only increase being found in early-type strongly barred galaxies,
consistent with previous IRAS studies. The F15/F7 excesses are unambiguously
due to galactic central regions where bar-induced starbursts occur. However,
the existence of strongly barred early-type galaxies with normal circumnuclear
colors indicates that the relationship between a distortion of the
gravitational potential and a central starburst is not straightforward. As the
physical processes at work in central regions are in principle identical in
barred and unbarred galaxies, and since this is where the mid-infrared activity
is mainly located, we investigate the mid-infrared circumnuclear properties of
all the galaxies in our sample. We show how surface brightnesses and colors are
related to both the available molecular gas content and the mean age of stellar
populations contributing to dust heating. Therefore, the star formation history
in galactic central regions can be constrained by their position in a
color-surface brightness mid-infrared diagram.

The fact that the 15 to 7 micron flux ratio is nearly constant in various
global exciting conditions indicates a common origin, namely the aromatic
infrared band carriers, and implies that at these wavelengths, dust emission
from the disks of normal galaxies is dominated by photodissociation regions and
not by HII regions themselves. We use this newly-found correlation between the
mid-infrared and the Halpha line to investigate the nature of the link between
the far-infrared (60 and 100 microns) and Halpha. Although the separation of
the central regions from the disk is impossible to achieve in the far-infrared,
we show that a circumnuclear contribution to the dust emission, having no
equivalent counterpart in Halpha, is most likely responsible for the well-known
non-linearity between far-infrared and Halpha fluxes in spiral galaxies. We
derive a calibration of 7 and 15 micron fluxes in terms of star formation rates
from a primary calibration of Halpha in the literature, and also outline the
applicability limits of the proposed conversion, which should not be blindly
extrapolated to objects whose nature is unknown.

normal boxy-shaped disk seen at high inclination angle. We do not see any
unambiguous observational signature of a bar. There is an asymmetrical
extension of stars along one end of the major axis of the galaxy, and this is
where the furthest star-forming regions are found, at 1.3R_Holmberg. The HI is
normal in many respects but shows some anomalies: 1) The integrated HI shows
two ridges running parallel to the major axis that deproject to a large ring.
2) The velocity field exhibits several large-scale anomalies superposed on a
rotating disk. 3) The inclination and position angles derived from the
kinematics differ from those dervied from the optical and HI mor- phology. 4)
There are regions in the HI of unusually high velocity dispersion that
correlate with deficits of HI emission in a manner suggestive of long-range,
turbulent pressure equilibrium. Star-forming regions are found where the gas
densities locally exceed 6 Msolar/pc^2. NGC 2366, like other irregulars, has
low gas densities relative to the critical gas densities of gravitational
instability models. Because of the lack of shear in the optical galaxy, there
is little competition to the slow gravitational contraction that follows energy
dissipation. However, the peak gas densities in the star-forming regions are
equal to the local tidal densities for gravitational self-binding of a rotating
cloud. Evidently the large scale gas concentrations are marginally bound
against background galactic tidal forces. This condition for self-binding may
be more fundamental than the instability condition because it is local,
three-dimensional, and does not involve spiral arm generation as an
intermediate step toward star formation.

white dwarfs in GCs of ~0.5 Msun. This suggests that K 648 is descended from a

PNe. (2) Yellow PAGB stars are the visually brightest stars in old populations

thus they show great promise as a Pop II standard candle. Two yellow PAGB stars
in the GC NGC 5986 have the same V magnitudes to within +/-0.05 mag, supporting
an expected narrow luminosity function. (3) Using CCD photometry and a u filter

planetary-mass isolated objects could be as common as brown dwarfs; both kinds

found that the observed CN and CH band strengths are best matched by the

little if any mixing is taking place during red giant branch ascent in M71, and
2) a substantial component of the C and N abundance inhomogeneities is in place
before the main sequence turn-off. The unlikelihood of mixing while on the main
sequence requires an explanation for the abundance variations which lies
outside the present stars (primordial inhomogeneities or intra-cluster self
enrichment). For M13 it is shown that the 3883\AA CN bands are too weak to be
measured in the spectra for any reasonable set of expected compositions. A
similar situation exists for CH as well. However, two of the more luminous

find that, at 95% confidence, less than 25% of our primary lenses have

emitted from thermally-unstable discs to provide detailed theoretical
predictions for observationally relevant quantities. The emergent spectrum has
been obtained by solving self-consistently the vertical structure and radiative
transfer in the disc atmosphere. We focus on four particular stages of the disc
evolution, the maximal evacuation stage and three intermediate stages during
the replenishment phase. The disc is found to undergo rather dramatic spectral
changes during the evolution, emitting mainly in the 1-10 keV band during
outburst and in the 0.1-1 keV band off-outburst. Local spectra, although
different in shape from a blackbody at the disc effective temperature, may be

for the integrated density of eigenvalues from which the Green's function and
averaged density of eigenvalues could be calculated in a simple manner. Thus,
that formalism may be thought of as the non-hermitean analog of the method due
to Br\'ezin, Itzykson, Parisi and Zuber for analyzing hermitean non-Gaussian

correction weight to KoralW. KoralW introduces the ${\cal O}(\alpha)$
correction using this weight, and finishes processing the event (rejection due

interference between one and two loop diagrams can be constructive in a large

muon anomalous magnetic moment even in the flavor conserving process with a
heavy neutral scalar boson ($m_h \sim$ 200 GeV) once the effective muon Yukawa

sigma model by using a combination of derivative expansion and expansion in
powers of the fields. According to the sigma model approach to bosonic open
string theory, the tachyon effective action $S(T)$ coincides with the
renormalized partition function $Z(T)$ of sigma model on a disk, up to a term
vanishing on shell. On the other hand, $Z(T)$ is a generating functional of
perturbative open string scattering amplitudes. If $S(T) = Z(T)$, then there
should be no contribution of exchange diagrams to string amplitudes computed
using $S(T)$. We compute the cubic term in the effective action, and show that
it vanishes if some but not all external legs are on shell, and, therefore, any
exchange diagram involving the cubic term vanishes too. Then, we discuss a
problem of turning on nonrenormalizable boundary interactions, corresponding to
massive string modes. We compute the quadratic term for a symmetric tensor
field, and show that despite nonrenormalizability of the model one can
consistently remove all divergent terms, and obtain a quadratic action
reproducing the on-shell condition for the field. We also briefly discuss
fermionic (NS) sigma model, compute the tachyon quadratic term, and show that
it reproduces the correct tachyon mass. We note that turning on a massive
symmetric tensor field leads to the appearance of a term linear in it, which
can be removed by adding a higher-derivative term to the boundary of the disc.

can couple to background spacetime fields. This coupling implies that a
D0-brane may possess multipole moments with respect to the various type IIA
supergravity fields. Different such polarization states of the D0-brane will
thus generate different long-range supergravity fields, and the corresponding
semi-classical supergravity solutions will have different geometries. In this
paper, we reconsider such solutions from an eleven-dimensional perspective. We
thus begin by deriving the ``superpartners'' of the eleven-dimensional
graviton. These superpartners are obtained by acting on the purely bosonic
solution with broken supersymmetries and, in theory, one can obtain the full
BPS supermultiplet of states. When we dimensionally reduce a polarized
supergraviton along its direction of motion, we recover a metric which
describes a polarized D0-brane. On the other hand, if we compactify along the
retarded null direction we obtain the short distance, or ``near-horizon'',
geometry of a polarized D0-brane, which is related to finite $N$ Matrix theory.
The various dipole moments in this case can only be defined once the
eleven-dimensional metric is ``regularized'' and, even then, they are formally
infinite. We argue, however, that this is to be expected in such a
non-asymptotically flat spacetime. Moreover, we find that the superpartners of
the D0-brane, in this $r \ra 0$ limit, possess neither spin nor D2-brane dipole
moments.

  introduction and typos",,,,"math.GT hep-th math.RT nlin.SI",,"  This paper begins with an observation that the isospectral leaves of the
signed Toda lattice as well as the Toda flow itself may be constructed from the
Tomei manifolds by cutting and pasting along certain chamber walls inside a
polytope. It is also observed through examples that although there is some
freedom in this procedure of cutting and pasting the manifold and the flow, the
choices that can be made are not arbitrary. We proceed to describe a procedure
that begins with an action of the Weyl group on a set of signs; it uses the
Convexity Theorem in \cite{BFR:90} and combines the resulting polytope with the
chosen Weyl group action to paste together a compact manifold. This manifold
which is obtained carries an action of the Weyl group and a Toda lattice flow
which is related to this action. This construction gives rise to a large family
of compact manifolds which is parametrized by twisted sign actions of the Weyl
group. For example, the trivial action gives rise to Tomei manifolds and the
standard action of the Weyl group on the connected components of a split Cartan
subgroup of a split semisimple real Lie group gives rise to the isospectral
leaves of the signed Toda lattice. This clarifies the connection between the
polytope in the Convexity Theorem and the topology of the compact smooth
manifolds arising from the isospectral leaves of a Toda flow. Furthermore, this
allows us to give a uniform treatment to two very different cases that have
been studied extensively in the literature producing new cases to look at.
Finally we describe the unstable manifolds of the Toda flow for these more
general manifolds and determine which of these give rise to cycles.

mass $A\sim60$ region. Special attention is paid to environmental effects, i.e.
finite temperature and density, on the cross sections. As these effects are
largest for small neutrino energies, it is sufficient to study only the
Gamow-Teller (GT) contributions to the cross sections. The relevant GT strength
distributions are derived from large-scale shell model calculations. We find
that the low-energy cross sections are enhanced at finite temperatures.
However, for $(\nu_e,e^-)$ reactions Pauli blocking of the electrons in the
final state makes the cross sections for low-energy neutrinos much smaller than
for the competing inelastic scattering on electrons at moderate and large
densities. Absorption cross sections for low-energy antineutrinos are strongly
enhanced at finite temperatures.

quark system undergoing second-order phase transition to hadrons. Emphasis is
placed on the search for an observable signature that is realistic for
heavy-ion collisions. It is suggested that in the 2-dimensional y-phi space the
produced particles selected in a very narrow p_T window may exhibit clustering
patterns even when integrated over the entire emission time. Using the Ising
model to simulate the critical phenomenon and taking into account a p_T
distribution that depends on the emission time, we study in the framework of
the void analysis proposed earlier and find scaling behavior. The scaling
exponents turn out to be larger than the ones found before for pure
configurations without mixing. The signature is robust in that it is
insensitive to the precise scheme of simulating time evolution. Thus it should
reveal whether or not the dense matter created in heavy-ion collisions is a
quark-gluon plasma before hadronization.

transverse momentum region, the soft and semi-hard multiple scattering of the
incoming nucleons in the nuclear medium results in the broadening of the
expected hadronic (e.g. pion) $p_\perp$ spectra relative to proton-proton
($pp$) collisions. Thus, higher transverse-momentum regions are populated than
in $pp$ collisions. In a perturbative QCD based calculation we include the
intrinsic transverse momentum ($k_\perp$) of the partons in the nucleon
(determined from $pp$ collisions), augmented by the extra broadening obtained
via a systematic analysis of proton-nucleus ($pA$) collisions in the energy
range 17$<\sqrt{s}<$ 39 AGeV. The original polynomial spectra are modified, and
a nearly exponential spectrum appears in the region 2$\lesssim p_\perp\lesssim
3.5$ GeV. At present RHIC energies ($\sqrt{s}=$130 AGeV), the slope of the
calculated spectra is reminiscent of that of fluid-dynamical descriptions, but
lacks any thermal origin. We determine and discuss the size of the
modifications originating in multiple scattering, which lead to this state of
affairs.

motion regime for classical charged particles, actually, is a subtle
combination of an applied external force and the radiation reaction force. It
suggests, as the Equivalence Principle is valid, that the gravitational mass of
charged particle should be slight greater than its inertial mass. However, an
interesting new feature emerges from the unexpected behavior of the
gravitational and inertial mass relation at very strong gravitational field,
just reachable at the early stage of the universe or, perhaps, near massive
black holes, with a divergence that introduces a critical field value. It signs
that the Equivalence Principle should not be valid near to this critical field,
which certainly coincides where the quantum effects turns to be relevant.
