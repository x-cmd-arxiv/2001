of the equilibrium structure of dark matter halos that result from the
gravitational instability and fragmentation of cosmological pancakes. Such
halos resemble those formed by hierarchical clustering from realistic initial
conditions in a CDM universe and, therefore, serve as a test-bed model for
studying halo dynamics. The dark matter density profile is close to the
universal halo profile identified previously from N-body simulations of
structure formation in CDM, with a total mass and concentration parameter which
grow linearly with scale factor a. When gas is included, this concentration
parameter is slightly larger than the pure N-body result. We also find that the
dark matter velocity distribution is less isotropic and more radial than found
by N-body simulations of CDM.

occur every ~450 days, none had ever been previously observed in the extreme
ultra-violet (EUV) by ROSAT. The WFC observations began just ~13 hr after the
optical rise was detected. With a peak count rate of 4.5 count/s in the S1

while the optical brightness remained essentially static at V~11. Similar
behaviour has also been recently reported in the EUV light curve of the related
SU UMa-type binary OY Car during superoutburst (Mauche and Raymond 2000). In
contrast, U Gem-type dwarf novae show no such early EUV dip during normal
outbursts. Therefore, this feature may be common in superoutbursts of SU
UMa-like systems. We expand on ideas first put forward by Osaki (1994, 1995)

examining the interplay between the thermal and tidal instabilities which

Local Group irregular galaxy IC 1613. The nebulae are: S8, the only known
supernova remnant in this galaxy, and S3, a Wolf-Rayet nebula associated with
the only WO star in this galaxy. For S8, we have obtained and analyzed its
radial velocity field, where we found complex profiles which can be fitted by
several velocity components. These profiles also show the presence of high
velocity, low density gas. From this, we have obtained the expansion velocity,
estimated the preshock density and calculated the basic kinematical parameters
of this SNR. We suggest that in S8 we are seing a SNR partially hidden by dust.
This suggestion comes from the fact that the SNR is located between two
superbubbles where a ridge of obscured material unveils the existence of dust.
Moreover, we show that this hypothesis prevails when energetic arguments are
taken into account. In the case of S3, this nebula shows bipolar structure. By
means of its kinematics, we have analyzed its two lobes, the ``waist'', as well
as its relation with the nearest superbubbles. For the first time we are able
to see closed the NW lobe, showing a clover leaf shape. This fact allows a
better quantitative knowledge of the nebula as a whole. Furthermore, we found
evidence of an expansion motion in the NW lobe. In the light of our results, we
can express that these nebulae are the product of very massive stellar
evolution. It is surprising the influence these stars still have in shaping
their surrounding gas, and on the energy liberation towards the interstellar

distribution, motivated by the recent finding by Fujita and Takahara that X-ray
clusters form a fundamental plane, where the mass and formation epoch are
regarded as two independent parameters. Using the formalism which discriminates
between major merger and accretion, the epoch of a cluster formation is
identified with that of the last major merger. Since tiny mass accretion after
the formation does not much affect the core structure of clusters, the
properties of X-ray emission from clusters are determined by the total mass and
density at their formation time. Under these assumptions, we calculate X-ray
luminosity and temperature functions of galaxy clusters. We find that the
behavior of luminosity function is different from the model which does not take
account of formation epoch distribution, while the behavior of temperature
function is not much changed. In our model, luminosity function is shifted to a
higher luminosity and shows no significant evolution up to $z \sim 1$,
independent of cosmological models. The clusters are populated on the
temperature-luminosity plane with a finite dispersion. Since the simple scaling
model in which the gas temperature is equal to the virial temperature fails to
reproduce the observed luminosity-temperature relation, we also consider a
model which takes the effects of preheating into account. The preheating model
reproduces the observations much better.

always a polytrope when it reaches equilibrium (Nakamura 2000). This strongly
suggests as a corollary, however, that the same polytrope dominates its
precursor states, since the dynamical equations for its constituents can be
time-reversed. Moreover this assumption, which precludes a polytrope from ever
accreting 100% of the mass from an infalling shell, as a subsequent state will
eventually be a polytrope, is confirmed now by our finding that a collisionless
polytrope cannot accrete 100% of an infalling shell while simultaneously
guaranteeing that the entropy of the Universe as a whole increases. These
strictures are only evaded by the shedding of some mass. A polytrope must lose
mass to gain mass.
  We deduce from the time-reversible property of a collisionless polytrope that
the scalar sum, P, over constituent momenta in its rest frame is an independent
state variable that is conserved with respect to its surface radius through
interactions between a polytrope and an infalling shell. This new constraint,
together with conservation of energy, enables us (i) to show that an isolated
polytrope is indeed stable against spherically-symmetric mass-loss, which is
the essential content of our initial assumption; (ii) to calculate both the
velocity and the fraction of infall-mass returned to infinity, provided the
""accretion law"" between the change in mass and surface radius is specified.
Numerical results confirm a frequent empirical finding (Livio 2000) that the
velocity of a mass outflow is of the same order of magnitude as the escape
velocity from the system.

distribution vs. temperature, EM(T), of the flaring regions is derived from
Yohkoh/SXT observations in the rise, peak and decay of the flares. The EM(T) is
rather peaked and centered around $T \approx 10^7$ K for most of the time.
Typically, it grows during the rise phase of the flare, and then it decreases
and shifts toward lower temperatures during the decay, more slowly if there is
sustained heating. The most intense flare we studied shows emission measure
even at very high temperature ($T \approx 10^8$ K). Time-resolved X-ray spectra
both unfiltered and filtered through the instrumental responses of the

ascribed to the different morphological mixture of galaxies in the two

present in the IC. To this end we present a new approach based on a concept of
the monomer identity breaking and density functional description. We strictly
derive, via a proper choice of basic structural units of the gel fraction, all
statements usually supposed to be just Flory (Stockmayer) assumptions. A
further analysis of the IC structure reveals some new IC structural units
(those involved into mesoscopic cycles) overlooked in both Flory and Stockmayer
approaches and to be described by a new order parameter characteristic only of
the gel phase. As a result, the SGT is found to transform from a geometric
phenomenon to a genuine 1st order phase transition always followed by a phase
separation into sol and gel phases. The free energy, total conversion, volume
fractions of the gel fraction and dangling monomers as well as other structural
quantities are calculated as functions of a reduced monomer density and
analyzed for all the existing models. The Flory approach is found to be
superior to the Stockmayer-Tanaka one and satisfactorily describe some of the
dense weak gel properties but fail (even qualitatively) in a quite extended

CET is based on quantum
chromodynamics and describes the processes of strong interaction at low
energies. It is proved, that CET comes as a consequence of the spontaneous
violation of chiral symmetry in QCD - the appearance of chiral symmetry
violating vacuum condensates. The Goldstone theorem for the case of QCD is
proved and the existence of the octet of massless Goldstone bosons (pi, K, eta)
is demonstrated in the limit of massless u,d,s quarks (or the triplet of
massless pions in the limit m_u,m_d->0). It is shown, that the same phenomenon
- the appearance of quark condensate in QCD - which causes the Goldstone
bosons, results in appearance of violating chiral symmetry massive baryons. The
general form of CET Lagrangian is derived. Few examples of higher order
corrections to tree diagrams in CET are given. The Wess-Zumino term (of order
p^4 term in CET Lagrangian) is presented. Low energy sum rules are presented.
QCD and CET at finite temperature are discussed. In the framework of CET the
T^2 correction to quark condensate in QCD at finite temperature T is calculated
and the results of higher order temperature corrections are demonstrated. These
results indicate on phase transition in QCD at T \sim 150-200 MeV. The mixing
of current correlators in order T^2 is proved.

interior-point methods for linear optimization over symmetric cones, of which
linear and semidefinite programming are special cases. We are classifying all
self-scaled barriers over irreducible symmetric cones and show that these
functions are merely homothetic transformations of the universal barrier
function. Together with a decomposition theorem for self-scaled barriers this
concludes the algebraic classification theory of these functions. After
introducing the reader to the concepts relevant to the problem and tracing the
history of the subject, we start by deriving our result from first principles
in the important special case of semidefinite programming. We then generalise
these arguments to irreducible symmetric cones by invoking results from the
theory of Euclidean Jordan algebras.

oscillatory system, which is forced by oscillating perturbation. Many physical
applications of the autoresonance are known in nonlinear physics. The essence
of the phenomenon is that the nonlinear oscillator selfadjusts to the varying
external conditions so that it remains in resonance with the driver for a long
time. This long time resonance leads to a strong increase in the response
amplitude under weak driving perturbation. An analytic treatment of a simple
mathematical model is done here by means of asymptotic analysis using a small
driving parameter. The main result is finding threshold for entering the

that neither energy velocity nor group velocity is a good concept to describe
