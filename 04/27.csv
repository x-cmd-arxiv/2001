kinematic properties of the young (<~1 Gyr) and old (> few Gyr) stellar
populations. The young stellar populations are more centrally concentrated than
the older populations, but they are not confined to the galaxy core (radius <~
1 kpc). The kinematics of the old stellar population place 16 of 20 of our E+As
on a trend parallel to the Faber-Jackson relation that is offset by $\sim$ 0.6
mag in R. Eighteen of 20 E+As have v/sigma < 1. As the young stars in these
systems evolve, the luminosity offset will disappear and the remnants will be
pressure-supported systems that lie on the Faber-Jackson relation. Although
Zabludoff et al. spectroscopically selected the most extreme E+A galaxies in
the local volume, the sample is kinematically diverse: velocity dispersions
range from <~ 30 km/s to ~ 200 km/s over a luminosity range of M_R = -19 to -22
+ 5 log h. Combining these results with an estimate of the number of galaxies
that experience an E+A phase, we conclude that the E+A phase of galaxy
evolution is important in the development of a large fraction of
spheroid-dominated galaxies over a wide range of luminosities and masses. Our
kinematic observations, together with evidence that E+As have recently evolved
from a vigorous star forming phase to a quiescent phase (e.g. Couch and
Sharples, Caldwell et al.) and that many have tidal features consistent with
disk-like progenitors (Zabludoff et al.), indicate that these galaxies are
undergoing a transformation from star-forming, disk-dominated galaxies into
quiescent, spheroid-dominated galaxies.

stars in inner spheroid and outer halo clusters have similar slopes, although
there is a tendency for core-collapsed clusters to have slightly flatter

stars on the (K, J-K) CMDs of inner spheroid clusters with [Fe/H] ~ -1.5 is
very different from that of clusters with [Fe/H] ~ -2.2, suggesting that

is used to compute distances to these objects. Finally, the specific frequency

wide range of cosmological phenomena. Nevertheless, since evidence for
non-baryonic dark matter remains indirect, all reasonable alternatives should
be explored. One proposed idea, involving a fundamental acceleration scale a_0
= 1-2e-10 m/s^2, is called MOdified Newtonian Dynamics or MOND. MOND was
suggested to explain the flat rotation curves of galaxies without the need for
dark matter. Whether or not it can adequately fit the available data has been
debated for almost 20 years (and we summarise many of these studies), but only
recently have there been attempts to extend MOND to larger scale regimes. We
discuss how the basic properties of MOND make it at best ambiguous to apply
these ideas to cosmological scales. We emphasize the difficulties inherent in
developing a full theory in which to embed MOND. Without such a theory there is
no obviously consistent way to discuss the early Universe and the growth of
perturbations. Recent claims that MONDian cosmology works very well are
therefore not supportable. We also provide an argument for why a_0~cH_0
naturally, a coincidence which is often suggested as a motivation for taking
MOND seriously. We discuss other alternative theories of gravity concluding, as
others have, that no metric theory extensions appear workable for explaining
rotation curves as well as other observed phenomena. The whole premise of many
of these attempts is fatally flawed - galaxies are not pre-selected, discrete,
isolated regions which formed monolithically and around which one can construct
an axially-symmetric dynamical model in order to remove the need for dark
matter. In the modern view, galaxies are part of a dynamic continuum of objects
which collectively make up the evolving large-scale structure of the universe.

the Keck 7.9, 9.7, and 12.5 $\um$ images, corroborating the predictions based

suggest that the highly equatorially-enhanced ($\rho_{\rm eq}/\rho_{\rm pole} =

the spread in angular momentum (J) at any given mass is more than a factor of

This is a consequence of both a small increase in observed specific angular

decreasing mass. Perhaps the most striking fact, however, is that j varies by
so little - less than a factor of two - over the interval 0.1-1.0 M_sun. The

thousands of supernovae per year out to a redshift of 1.7. Although it is
exceedingly unlikely that we will see a multiply-imaged supernova from ongoing

Since having a standard candle is inessential to most lensing studies, SNAP's
large sample of type II supernovae contributes to this rate. Each case of
strong lensing allows for a precise determination of time delays, image
separations, and relative image magnifications, and the SNAP strong-lensing
database will offer measures of $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_\Lambda$, and $H_0$,
independent of SNAP's primary goal of establishing the distance-redshift
relation. These systems also constrain models for the matter density profiles
of galaxies and clusters. Furthermore, lensed type Ia supernovae afford the
opportunity to break the mass-sheet degeneracy found in many lensing

account uncertainties in all free parameters in the simplest gravitational

estimates of the baryon fraction from the forest do prefer values that are
somewhat higher than the big bang nucleosynthesis value of \Omega_b h^2 = 0.02
\pm 0.001, the discrepancy is at best about 3 \sigma. For instance, assuming
the highest estimate of the ionizing background, as indicated by recent
measurements of a large escape fraction from Lyman-break galaxies by Steidel,

expression from which future likelihoods for \Omega_b h^2 can be derived as
measurements of the ionizing background improve -- consistency among
constraints from the forest, nucleosynthesis and the microwave background will
provide a powerful test of the gravitational instability model. We also develop
a formalism which treats lower bounds on the baryon density in a statistical
manner, which is appropriate if only a lower bound on the ionizing background
is known. Finally, we discuss the implications of the escape fraction

perfectly 2D, has two branches due to a coupling between layers within a
double-layer. Each branch exhibits a characteristic intensity oscillation along
the out-of-plane direction. We found that the in-plane spin stiffness constant
and the gap between the two branches strongly depend on x. By fitting to
calculated dispersion relations and cross sections assuming Heisenberg models,
we have obtained the in-plane (J_para), intra-bilayer (J_perp) and
inter-bilayer (J') exchange interactions at each x. At x=0.30, J_para=-4meV and
J_perp=-5meV, namely almost isotropic and ferromagnetic. Upon increasing x,
J_perp rapidly approaches zero while |J_para| increases slightly, indicating an
enhancement of the planar magnetic anisotropy. At x=0.48, J_para reaches -9meV,
while J_perp turns to +1meV indicating an antiferromagnetic interaction. Such a
drastic change of the exchange interactions can be ascribed to the change of
the relative stability of the d_x^2-y^2 and d_3z^2-r^2 orbital states upon
doping. However, a simple linear combination of the two states results in an
orbital state with an orthorhombic symmetry, which is inconsistent with the

the scaling behavior of the energy gap between the global energy minimum and
the next lowest minimum of the manifold is considered, by employing exact
ground state calculations and an extreme statistics argument. The scaling has a
logarithmic prefactor originating from the number of the minima in the
landscape, and reads $\Delta E_1 \sim L^\theta [\ln(L_z L^{-\zeta})]^{-1/2}$,
where $\zeta$ is the roughness exponent and $\theta$ is the energy fluctuation
exponent of the manifold, $L$ is the linear size of the manifold, and $L_z$ is
the system height. The gap scaling is extended to the case of a finite external
field and yields for the susceptibility of the manifolds $\chi_{tot} \sim
L^{2D+1-\theta} [(1-\zeta)\ln(L)]^{1/2}$. We also present a mean field argument

use the coupled cluster method (CCM) for high orders of approximation (up to
LSUB6) and the exact diagonalization of finite systems (up to 32 sites) to
calculate ground-state properties. The role of quantum fluctuations is examined
by comparing the ferromagnetic-spiral and the antiferromagnetic-spiral
transition within the same model. We find clear evidence that quantum
fluctuations prefer collinear order and that they may favour a first order
transition instead of a second order transition in case of no quantum

topological, ultraviolet divergences are less singular in our model. In the
gauge model, matter fermions are introduced on the discrete lattice following
Wilson. Then, the 4d gauge interactions are correctly generated from the 3d

two kinds of discrete lattices have to be introduced separately for L- and

  Symmetry Breaking Solutions for the $P^2+iX^3+i\alpha X$ Hamiltonian","Submitted to J. Phys. A",,,,"math-ph math.MP",,"  The recent work of Delabaere and Trinh (2000 J. Phys. A 33 8771) discovered
the existence of ${\cal P}{\cal T}$-symmetry breaking, complex energy, $L^2$
solutions for the one dimensional Hamiltonian, $P^2+iX^3+i\alpha X$, in the
asymptotic limit, $\alpha \to -\infty$. Their asymptotic analysis produced
questionable results for moderate values of $\alpha$. We can easily confirm the
existence of ${\cal P}{\cal T}$-symmetry breaking solutions, by explicitly
computing the low lying states, for $|\alpha| < O (10)$. Our analysis makes use
of the Multiscale Reference Function (MRF) approach, developed by Tymczak et al
(1998 Phys. Rev. Lett. 80 3678; 1998 Phys. Rev. A 58, 2708). The MRF results
can be validated by comparing them with the converging eigenenergy bounds
generated through the Eigenvalue Moment Method, as recently argued by Handy
(2001a,b). Given the reliability of the MRF analysis, its fast numerical
implementation, high accuracy, and theoretical simplicity, the present
formalism defines an effective and efficient procedure for analyzing many
related problems that have appeared in the recent literature.

analysis of regular zigzag structures which reveals that traveling zigzags
bifurcate from stationary zigzags via a pitchfork bifurcation. This bifurcation
changes from supercritical (forward) to subcritical (backward) as a function of
the CGLE coefficients, and we show the relevance of this for the `phase
diagram'. Our findings indicate that in the zigzag parameter regime of the
CGLE, the transition between defect-rich and defect-poor states is governed by
bifurcations of the zigzag structures.
