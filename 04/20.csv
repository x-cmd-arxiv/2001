baryons in the universe, which released energy following their condensation out
of a cold, dark, and neutral IGM into the earliest galaxies. The theory of this
reionization is a critical missing link in the theory of galaxy formation. Its
numerous observable consequences include effects on the spectrum, anisotropy
and polarization of the cosmic microwave background and signatures of
high-redshift star and quasar formation. This energy release also created
feedback on galaxy formation which left its imprint on the mass spectrum and
internal characteristics of galaxies and on the gas between galaxies long after
reionization was complete. Recent work suggests that the photoevaporation of
dwarf galaxy minihalos may have consumed most of the photons required to
reionize the currently-favored Lambda-CDM universe. We will review recent
developments in our understanding of this process.

full 1250 - 3090 A range. Iron emission is often a severe contaminant in
optical--UV spectra of AGNs. Its presence complicates and limits the accuracy
of measurements of both strong and weak emission lines and the continuum
emission, affecting studies of line and continuum interrelations, the
ionization structure, and elemental abundances in AGNs. Despite the wealth of
work on modeling the AGN FeII emission and the need to account for it in
observed AGN spectra, there is no UV template electronically available to aid
this process. The iron template we present is based on HST spectra of the
Narrow Line Seyfert 1, IZw1. Its intrinsic narrow lines (~900 km/s) and rich
iron spectrum make the template particularly suitable for use with most AGN
spectra. The iron emission spectrum and the line identifications and
measurements are presented and compared with the work of Laor et al. We
illustrate the application of the derived FeII and FeIII templates by fitting
and subtracting the iron emission from UV spectra of four high-z quasars and of
the nearby quasar, 3C273. We briefly discuss the small discrepancies between
this observed iron emission and the UV template, and compare the template with
previously published ones. We discuss the advantages and limitations of the
templates and of the template fitting method. We conclude that the templates
work sufficiently well to be a valuable and important tool for eliminating and
studying the iron emission in AGNs, at least until accurate theoretical iron

variable compact radio lobes which form near the core, move diametrically
outward, then fade away. Subsequently, a new lobe-pair form near the core and
the behavior repeats. The differences in the radio properties of the two lobes
are consistent with the delay and Doppler-boosting associated with an average
space velocity of 0.45c at 44 deg to the line of sight. Four lobe speeds,
between 0.32c and 0.57c, were measured for several lobe-pairs on different
days. The speed during each epoch remained constant over many hours. The
direction of motion of the lobes over all epochs remained constant to a few
degrees.

enrichment by supernovae with progenitors belonging to the simple stellar
population (SSP) observed in cluster galaxies, if stars formed with a standard
initial mass function (IMF). Moreover, new results on ICM oxygen abundances
imply that nucleosynthesis occurred with nonstandard yields. The hypothesis
that hypernovae (HN) in general, and HN associated with Population III (Pop
III) stars in particular, may significantly contribute to ICM enrichment is
presented and evaluated. The observed abundance anomalies can be explained by a
hypernovae-producing subpopulation of the SSP, but only if it accounts for half
of all supernova explosions and if Type Ia supernova rates are very low. Also,
the implied energy release may be excessive. However, an independent Pop III
contribution -- in the form of metal-free, very massive stars that evolve into
hypernovae -- can also account for all the observed abundances, while avoiding
these drawbacks and accommodating a normal IMF in subsequent stellar
generations. The required number of Pop III stars provides sufficient energy
injection (at high redshift) to explain the ICM ``entropy floor''. Pop III
hypernova pre-enrich the intergalactic medium, and can produce a significant
fraction of the metals observed in the Lyman-alpha forest. Several testable
predictions for ICM and IGM observations are made.

galaxy cluster A3128. Our observations are intentionally relatively shallow,
and a blind search through our data cube yields (tentative) detections of only
two galaxies, of which one is probably spurious.
  A3128 is part of the ESO Nearby Abell Cluster Survey (ENACS); redshifts are
available for 193 galaxies in the A3128 region. For 148 of these galaxies the
redshifts are such that the HI emission (if any) would lie within our data
cube. We use the known redshifts of these galaxies to coadd their spectra and
thus improve our sensitivity to HI emission. The technique is fairly successful
-- the coadded spectra allow detection of an average mass content of ~ 9x10^8
Msun, almost an order of magnitude lower than for direct detection of
individual objects.
  By dividing the total galaxy sample into subsamples we find that the gas
content of late type galaxies that lie outside the X-ray emitting core of the
cluster is substantially higher than that of those within the core. Even
outside the X-ray emitting region the distribution of gas-rich galaxies in the
cluster is not uniform, we find that gas-rich galaxies are concentrated in the
east of the cluster. This is consistent with earlier analyses of the kinematics
of the galaxies in A3128 which indicate the presence of subclustering.
  In summary we find that coadding spectra is a powerful tool for the study of
HI in cluster galaxies, and suggest that this technique could be applied to
substantially increase the redshift range over which such observations could be
carried out.

distribution of peak heights in maps of the temperature fluctuations from the
kinematic and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects will be highly non-Gaussian,
and very different from the peak height distribution of a Gaussian random
field. We then show that it is a good approximation to assume that each peak in
either SZ effect is associated with one and only one dark matter halo. This
allows us to use our knowledge of the properties of haloes to estimate the peak
height distributions. At fixed optical depth, the distribution of peak heights
due to the kinematic effect is Gaussian, with a width which is approximately
proportional to optical depth; the non-Gaussianity comes from summing over a
range of optical depths. The optical depth is an increasing function of halo
mass, and the distribution of halo speeds is Gaussian, with a dispersion which
is approximately independent of halo mass. This means that observations of the
kinematic effect can be used to put constraints on how the abundance of massive
clusters evolves, and on the evolution of cluster velocities. The
non-Gaussianity of the thermal effect, on the other hand, comes primarily from
the fact that, on average, the effect is larger in more massive haloes, and the
distribution of halo masses is highly non-Gaussian. We also show that because
haloes of the same mass may have a range of density and velocity dispersion
profiles, the relation between halo mass and the amplitude of the thermal
effect is not deterministic, but has some scatter.

numbers of the required ultramassive black-hole X-ray binaries is problematic,
and the likely transient behaviour of the resulting systems is not in good
accord with observation. The assumption of mild X-ray beaming suggests instead
that ULXs may represent a shortlived but extremely common stage in the
evolution of a wide class of X-ray binaries. The best candidate for this is the
phase of thermal-timescale mass transfer inevitable in many intermediate and
high-mass X-ray binaries. This in turn suggests a link with the Galactic
microquasars. The short lifetimes of high-mass X-ray binaries would explain the
association of ULXs with episodes of star formation. These considerations still
allow the possibility that individual ULXs may contain extremely massive black

The sample under study is separated by the criteria: EW([O III]5007 > 45 A and
V < 6,000 km/s and should be representative of all low-mass galaxies which
experience SF bursts. We argue that the moderate tidal disturbers should be

vicinity of the studied BCGs are found through the study of their environment
among UZC galaxies, and the follow-up careful search of the fainter galaxies in

based on the results of the 6-m telescope spectroscopy. By studing the data on
the radial velocities of galaxies in the vicinity of BCGs we found: 1) 33 of

  ""Astronomy in Ukraine, 2000 and beyond"", Kyiv, Ukraine, 5-8 June 2000",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The well-known light minima of stars with the R Coronae Borealis variability
are caused by the formation of an additional circumstellar dust shell, the
screening shell, inside the permanent shell. Under the assumption of uniform
distribution of matter in the circumstellar environment we estimated the
optical thickness of the permanent gas-and-dust shell at 0.2-0.7, and its
geometrical thickness is no less than 0.4 of its own radius. The wavelength
dependence of extinction is close to neutral. From spectral observations of R
CrB itself in the 1985 minimum we traced the transformation of the stellar
linear and molecular absorption spectrum to the emission spectrum and
established that the fast variation of the U-B colour index by -0.6 in the
light decline was caused purely by a change of the spectrum type. The spectrum
transformation causes an increase of star brightness in the U, B, and V bands
by about 1.4, 0.75, and 0.75 mags, correspondingly. It is suggested that a
high-velocity (>200 km/s) matter stream through the circumstellar environment
is the cause of the excitation of the emissions observed during light minima
when the photospheric flux is weakening.

enhanced scattering with the nearly critical spin fluctuations, the electrons
in the hot region are strongly renormalized. We argue that there is an
intermediate energy scale where the qualitative aspects of the renormalized hot
electrons are captured by a weak-coupling perturbative calculation. Our
examination of the electron self energy shows that the entropy carried by the
hot electrons is larger than usual. This accounts for the anomalous logarithmic
temperature dependence of specific heat observed in these materials. We show
that the same mechanism produces logarithmic temperature dependence in
thermopower. This has been observed in $ {\rm CeCu}_{6-x}{\rm Au}_x $. We
expect to see the same behaviour from future experiments on ${\rm YbRh}_2{\rm

lattices with constant phase shifts between neighboring layers, starting from
zero for a rectangular configuration to $\pi$ for a triangular configuration,

resonantly enhanced when the Josephson frequency matches the frequency of the
plasma mode at the wave vector selected by the lattice structure. The regular
lattices exhibit several kinds of instabilities. We find stability regions of
the moving lattice in the plane lattice structure - Josephson frequency. A
specific lattice structure at given velocity is selected uniquely by boundary
conditions, which are determined by the reflection properties of
electromagnetic waves generated by the moving lattice. With increase of
velocity the moving configuration experiences several qualitative
transformations. At small velocities the regular lattice is stable and the
phase shift between neighboring layers smoothly decreases with increase of
velocity, starting from $\pi$ for a static lattice. At the critical velocity
the lattice becomes unstable. At even higher velocity a regular lattice is
restored again with the phase shift smaller than $\pi/2$. With increase of

the typical relaxation time for F_s(q,z,t) increases like exp(Delta/(z-z_p)),
where Delta and z_p are constants. We use the location of the crossover from
this law to the bulk behavior to define a first length scale tilde{z}. A
different length scale is defined by considering the Ansatz F_s(q,z,t) =

the data for all times and all values of z. The length xi(t) increases for
short and intermediate times and decreases again on the time scale of the
alpha-relaxation of the system. The maximum value of xi(t) can thus be defined
as a new length scale xi_max. We find that tilde{z} as well as xi_max increase

state. These two bosonic quasiparticles may be responsible for the
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of the system associated with electron pairs.

waveforms covering the post-orbital dynamics of a binary black hole system with
the numerical simulation covering the essential non-linear interaction before
the close limit becomes applicable for the late time dynamics. To determine
when close-limit perturbation theory is applicable we apply a combination of
invariant a priori estimates and a posteriori consistency checks of the
robustness of our results against exchange of linear and non-linear treatments
near the interface. Once the numerically modeled binary system reaches a regime
that can be treated as perturbations of the Kerr spacetime, we must
approximately relate the numerical coordinates to the perturbative background
coordinates. We also perform a rotation of a numerically defined tetrad to
asymptotically reproduce the tetrad required in the perturbative treatment. We
can then produce numerical Cauchy data for the close-limit evolution in the
form of the Weyl scalar $\psi_4$ and its time derivative $\partial_t\psi_4$
with both objects being first order coordinate and tetrad invariant. The
Teukolsky equation in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates is adopted to further
continue the evolution. To illustrate the application of these techniques we
evolve a single Kerr hole and compute the spurious radiation as a measure of
the error of the whole procedure. We also briefly discuss the extension of the

scattering (from the threshold to 1.9 GeV) and of the $\pi\pi\to K\overline{K}$
process (from the threshold to $\sim$ 1.46 GeV) is carried out in channel with
$I^GJ^{PC}=0^+0^{++}$. The existence of the $f_0(665)$ state with properies of
the $\sigma$-meson is proved. An indication for the glueball nature of the
$f_0(1500)$ is obtained. A minimum scenario of the simultaneous description of
the processes $\pi\pi\to\pi\pi,K\overline{K}$ does without the ${f_0}(1370)$
resonance. A version including this state is also considered. In this case the
${f_0}(1370)$ resonance has the dominant $s{\bar s}$ component (the ratio of
its coupling constant with the $\pi\pi$ channel to the one with the
$K\overline{K}$ channel is 0.12). The coupling constants of the observed states
with the $\pi\pi$ and $K\overline{K}$ systems and the $\pi\pi$ and
$K\overline{K}$ scattering lengths are obtained. A parameterless description of
the $\pi\pi$ background is given by allowance for the left-hand branch-point in
the uniformizing variable. On the basis of this and of the fact that all the
adjusted parameters for the $\pi\pi$ scattering are only the positions of poles
describing resonances, it is concluded that our model-independent approach is a
valuable tool for studying the realization schemes of chiral symmetry. The
existence of the $f_0(665)$ state and the obtained $\pi\pi$-scattering length
($a_0^0\approx 0.27 m_{\pi^+}^{-1}$) seem to suggest the linear realization of
chiral symmetry.

linking sheaves on a projective space to graded modules over an exterior
algebra. We give an explicit construction of a Beilinson monad for a sheaf on
projective space. The explicitness allows us to to prove two conjectures about
the morphisms in the monad. We also construct all the monads for a sheaf that
can be built from sums of line bundles. A large subclass, containing many
monads introduced by others, are uniquely characterized by simple numerical
data. Our methods also yield an efficient method for machine computation of the
cohomology of sheaves.
  Along the way we study minimal free resolutions over an exterior algebra. For
example, we show that such resolutions are eventually dominated by their
""linear parts"" in the sense that erasing all terms of degree $>1$ in the
complex yields a new complex which is eventually exact.

Eisenbud-Schreyer and by Fl{\o}ystad seperately.

quantify the total pattern of fluctuations for predictability studies. The
power spectra of temporal fluctuations are broadband and exhibit inverse power
law form with different slopes for different scale ranges. Inverse power-law
form for power spectra implies scaling (self similarity) for the scale range
over which the slope is constant. Atmospheric flows therefore exhibit multiple
scaling or multifractal structure.Standard meteorological theory cannot explain
satisfactorily the observed multifractal structure of atmospheric
flows.Selfsimilar spatial pattern implies long-range spatial correlations.
Atmospheric flows therefore exhibit long-range spatiotemporal correlations,
namely,self-organized criticality,signifying order underlying apparent chaos. A
recently developed non-deterministic cell dynamical system model for
atmospheric flows predicts the observed self-organized criticality as intrinsic
to quantumlike mechanics governing flow dynamics.The model predictions are in
agreement with continuous periodogram spectral analysis of meteorological data

function of the desired state is thus sculpted from a Gaussian distribution.
The engineering process has also been developed to take into account the errors
arising from intensity fluctuations in the exciting-laser pulses required for
manipulating the electronic and vibrational states of the trapped ion. To this
end, a recently developed phenomenological-operator approach that allows for
the influence of noise will be applied. This approach furnishes a
straightforward technique to estimate the fidelity of the prepared state in the
presence of errors, precluding the usual extensive ab initio calculations. The
results obtained here by the phenomenological approach, to account for the
effects of noise in our engineering scheme, can be directly applied to any
other process involving trapped-ion phenomena.

""quantum cell probe model"". We prove a lower bound for the static predecessor
problem in the address-only version of this model where we allow quantum
parallelism only over the `address lines' of the queries. The address-only
quantum cell probe model subsumes the classical cell probe model, and many
quantum query algorithms like Grover's algorithm fall into this framework. Our
lower bound improves the previous known lower bound for the predecessor problem
in the classical cell probe model with randomised query schemes, and matches
the classical deterministic upper bound of Beame and Fich. Beame and Fich have
also proved a matching lower bound for the predecessor problem, but only in the
classical deterministic setting. Our lower bound has the advantage that it
holds for the more general quantum model, and also, its proof is substantially
simpler than that of Beame and Fich. We prove our lower bound by obtaining a
round elimination lemma for quantum communication complexity. A similar lemma
was proved by Miltersen, Nisan, Safra and Wigderson for classical communication
complexity, but it was not strong enough to prove a lower bound matching the
upper bound of Beame and Fich. Our quantum round elimination lemma also allows
us to prove rounds versus communication tradeoffs for some quantum
communication complexity problems like the ""greater-than"" problem. We also
study the ""static membership"" problem in the quantum cell probe model.
Generalising a result of Yao, we show that if the storage scheme is implicit,
that is it can only store members of the subset and `pointers', then any
quantum query scheme must make $\Omega(\log n)$ probes.
