instability in an exponentially-stratified and uniformly-rotating magnetized
gas disk by carrying out three-dimensional numerical simulations with an
isothermal magnetohydrodynamic code. The instability has been initialized by
random velocity perturbations. In the linear stage, the evolution is not much
different from that without rotation and the mixed (undular + interchange) mode
regulates the system. The interchange mode induces alternating dense and
rarefied regions with small radial wavelengths, while the undular mode bends
the magnetic field lines in the plane of azimuthal and vertical directions. In
the nonlinear stage, flow motion overall becomes chaotic as in the case without
rotation. However, as the gas in higher positions slides down along field lines
forming supersonic flows, the Coriolis force becomes important. As oppositely
directed flows fall into valleys along both sides of magnetic field lines, they
experience the Coriolis force toward opposite directions, which twists magnetic
field lines there. Hence, we suggest that the Coriolis force plays a role in
randomizing magnetic field. The three-dimensional density structure formed by
the instability is still sheet-like with the short dimension along the radial
direction, as in the case without rotation. However, the long dimension is now
slightly tilted with respect to the mean field direction. The shape of high
density regions is a bit rounder. The maximum enhancement factor of the
vertical column density relative to its initial value is about 1.5, which is
smaller than that in the case without rotation. We conclude that uniform
rotation doesn't change our point of view that the Parker instability alone is
not a viable mechanism for the formation of giant molecular clouds.

the gas that is seen in absorption in the X-ray spectrum of many AGN and show
that such gas can reach hydrostatic equilibrium under various conditions. The
principal conclusion is that the clouds can be accelerated to high velocities
by the central X-ray source. The dynamical problem can be reduced to the
calculation of a single parameter, the average force multiplier, <M>. The
typical value of <M> is ~10 suggesting that radiation pressure acceleration by
X-rays is efficient for L/L_Edd>0.1. The terminal velocity scales with the
escape velocity at the base of the flow and can exceed it by a large factor.
The typical velocity for a HIG flow that originates at R=1e17 cm in a source
with L_x=1e44 erg/s is ~1000 km/s, i.e. similar to the velocities observed in
several X-ray and UV absorption systems.
  Highly ionized AGN clouds are driven mainly by bound-free absorption and
bound-bound processes are less important unless the lines are significantly
broadened or the column density is very small. Pressure laws that result in
constant or outward decreasing ionization parameters are most effective in
accelerating the flow.

Taken together, these results show that luminous early-type galaxies exist in

We also find that the ratio of BH mass to bulge velocity dispersion is also

the BHs grow with accretion with a radiative efficiency of 0.1, it will take
them about $3.3\times 10^8$ years to become as massive as in normal Seyfert 1s.

the evolution of cataclysmic variables (CVs). We show that the angular momentum
prescriptions used in earlier CV studies are inconsistent with the measured
rotation data in open clusters. The timescale for angular momentum loss above
the fully convective boundary is ~ 2 orders of magnitude longer than inferred
from the older model, and the observed angular momentum loss properties show no
evidence for a change in a behavior at the fully convective boundary. This
provides evidence against the hypothesis that the period gap is caused by an
abrupt change in the angular momentum loss law when the secondary becomes fully
convective. It also implies that the timescale for CV evolution is much longer
than it was than previously thought, comparable to a Hubble time. For the same
reason, it will be more difficult to produce CVs from the products of common
envelope evolution and implies a lower space density of CVs. The empirical loss
law is consistent with the observed period minimum (1.3 hours) contrary to the
minimum predicted by angular momentum loss due to gravitational radiation alone
(1.1 hours).
  We introduce a method to infer the time-averaged mass accretion rate and
derive mass-period relation for different evolutionary states of the secondary.
The mass-period relationship is more consistent with evolved secondaries than
with unevolved secondaries above the period gap. Implications for the CV period
gap are discussed, including the possibility that two populations of
secondaries could produce the gap.

simple estimators of gravitational wave background power, and show that the
instrumental sensitivity to broad-band backgrounds at some frequencies can be
improved by more than an order of magnitude over the standard method,

This code has been tested computing the pulsation spectra of polytropic spheres
finding a good agreement with previous work. Then, we have coupled this code to
our evolutionary code and applied it to the computation of the pulsation
spectrum of a low mass, pure - helium white dwarf of 0.3 M_{sun} for a wide

To our notice this is the first effort in studying the pulsation properties of

also show that the observational constraints require $\Omega_{sr}< 3\times
10^{-3}\Omega_b$, confirming previous claims that the possible contribution of
the stellar remnants from Population III to the baryonic dark matter is
insignificant. At present, however, the scarcity of abundance measurements for
high redshift systems does not permit us to put severe limitations on the
nature of the initial mass function for Population III. In fact, overabundances
of alpha-elements with respect to iron of the order of those measured in damped
Lyman-$\alpha$ systems are obtained for any of the IMFs tested. Nevertheless,
to account for the very large [C,N/Fe] ratios found in a considerable number of
extremely metal-poor stars of our Galaxy, an IMF peaking at the intermediate
stellar mass range (4-8 M$_\odot$) is needed.

operational satellite explodes, the fragmentation process will take place close

hazard posed by these spacecraft if they explode and fall back to an Earth

in the simulations are determined self-consistently by the dynamics of
super-sonic turbulence. The models are intended to represent molecular clouds

Analytical approximations are derived for the cooling rates. The inhomogeneity
of the models reduces photon trapping and enhances the cooling in the densest
parts of the clouds. Compared with earlier models the cooling rates are less
affected by optical depth effects and are therefore higher. The main effects
comes, however, from the density variation since cooling efficiency increases
with density. This is very important for the cooling of the clouds as a whole
since most cooling is provided by gas with density above the average.

the flattest known for Seyferts, and (ii) the recent Chandra detection of an
X-ray narrow-line region in this galaxy. X-ray spectra as flat as that of NGC
4151 (Gamma_x = -1.5) are expected to favor the presence of two gas phases in

estimate the energy difference between the `symmetric ground state' (SGS),

that PPVs always have a higher energy than the SGS, and we derive a lower bound
of the excess energy. We argue that the lower bound is O(V^0), which becomes
much larger than the excitation energies of low-lying excited states for a
large V. We also discuss the collapse time of PPVs for interacting many bosons.
It is shown that the wave function collapses in a microscopic time scale,
because PPVs are not energy eigenstates. We show, however, that for PPVs the
expectation value of any observable, which is a finite polynomial of boson

demonstrated that for spinless electrons, interference between neighbouring

screening. We predict that the broadening-induced level splitting should be
clearly visible in measurements of the optical absorption power. A more general

theory, we have calculated the dielectric screening and the screened potential,

Coulomb potential. At half filling, we find that the Hubbard electrons
contribute only a minor fraction, Delta(epsilon) ~0.9 of the observed in-plane
dielectric constant of the cuprates, epsilon ~4.7. With increasing doping x,
the 1/r interaction is rapidly suppressed by metallic screening. Surprisingly,
near x ~5%, the low-frequency part of the screened potential V_S becomes
attractive, at distances r \ge 1. At r=1, it reaches maximum attraction
strength for dopings x ~13-15% and becomes repulsive again for for x ~23-25%.
Similar results are found for the pure 2D Hubbard model. The 1/r interaction
enhances the on-site and 1st neighbor overscreening attraction already present
in the pure model at finite doping. Our results are potentially relevant for
the d-wave pairing mechanism in the cuprates, suggesting that the screened 1/r
potential could actually increase the d-wave attraction, in the 5-25% doping
regime. They may also have implications for the isotope effect and its doping
dependence. At larger dopings, x>15%, the screened potential becomes attractive
even on-site, suggesting that it could support or enhance s-wave pairing. We
also give a rigorous analytical proof that the screened on-site interaction
must become attractive near half-filling in the repulsive large-U-limit, with
and without 1/r interaction. We present a simple physical interpretation of
this result in terms of retardation effects. We also point out that on-site
overscreening implies singularities in the imaginary frequency dependence of
the irreducible polarization insertion and its 3-point vertex function.

estimated using the fixed-spin-moment (FSM) method. From the total energy vs
spin magnetic moment curve for LaCoO$_3$ the ground state is found to be
nonmagnetic with the Co ions in a low-spin (LS) state, a result that is
consistent with the experimental observations. Somewhat higher in energy, we
find an intermediate-spin (IS) state with spin moment $\sim$1.2 $\mu_{B}$/f.u.
  From the anomalous temperature dependent susceptibility along with the
observation of an IS state we predict metamagnetism in LaCoO$_3$ originating
from an LS-to-IS transition. The IS state is found to be metallic and the
high-spin (HS) state of LaCoO$_3$ is predicted to be a half-metallic
ferromagnet. With increasing temperature, which is simulated by a corresponding
change of the lattice parameters we have observed the disappearence of the
metamagnetic solution that is associated with the IS state. The FSM
calculations on La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$CoO$_3$ suggest that the hole doping stabilizes
the IS state and the calculated magnetic moments are in good agreement with the
corresponding experimental values. Our calculations show that the HS state
cannot be stabilized by temperature or hole doping since the HS state is
significantly higher in energy than the LS or IS state. Hence the spin-state
transition in LaCoO$_3$ by temperature/hole doping is from an LS to an IS spin
state and the present work rules out the other possibilities reported in the

discovery. In this paper, we are going to present a method of detecting whether
there is an association between multiple SNP variations and a trait or disease.
The method exploits the Support Vector Machine which has been attracting lots
of attentions recently.

cosmic ray (GCR) intensity and the fraction of the Earth covered by clouds. If
this correlation were to be established by a causal mechanism, it could provide
a crucial step in understanding the long-sought mechanism connecting solar and
climate variability. The Earth's climate seems to be remarkably sensitive to
solar activity, but variations of the Sun's electromagnetic radiation appear to
be too small to account for the observed climate variability. However, since
the GCR intensity is strongly modulated by the solar wind, a GCR-cloud link may
provide a sufficient amplifying mechanism. Moreover if this connection were to
be confirmed, it could have profound consequences for our understanding of the
solar contributions to the current global warming. The CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving
