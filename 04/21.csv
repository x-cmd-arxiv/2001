counterpart to the GRB 010222, obtained with the FLWO 1.2-m telescope in UBVRI
passbands, starting 3.64 hours after the burst. We also present late R-band
observations of the afterglow obtained with the 1.8-m VATT ~25 days after the
burst. The temporal analysis of our data joined with published data indicates a
steepening decay, independent of wavelength, asymptotically approaching
t^{-0.80+/-0.05} at early times (t << 1 day) and t^{-1.30+/-0.05} at late
times, with a sharp break at t_b=0.72+/-0.1 days. This is the second earliest
observed break of any afterglow (after GRB 980519), which clearly indicates the
importance of rapid multi-band follow-up for GRB afterglow research. The
optical spectral energy distribution, corrected for small Galactic reddening,
can be fit fairly well by a single power-law with a slope of -1.07+/-0.09.
However, when we fit using our BVRI data only, we obtain a shallower slope of
-0.88+/- 0.1, in excellent agreement with the slope derived from our
low-resolution spectrum (-0.89 +/- 0.03). The spectral slope and light curve
decay slopes we derive are not consistent with a jet model despite the presence
of a temporal break. Significant host dust extinction with a star-burst
reddening law would flatten the spectral index to match jet predictions and
still be consistent with the observed spectral energy distribution. We derive
an opening angle of 2.1 deg, smaller than any listed in the recent compilation
of Frail et al. The total beamed energy corrected for the jet geometry is
4x10^50 erg, very close to the ``standard'' value of 5x10^50 erg found by Frail
et al. for a number of other bursts with light-curve breaks.

be fit by a model consisting of ionized reflection from the inner region of the

component from farther out on the the disc. The diskline is required to fit the
height of the observed Fe K line profile. However, we show that a much simpler
model of reflection from a very weakly ionized constant density disc also fits
the data. In this case only a single cold Fe K line at 6.4 keV is required to
fit the observed line. The ionized disc models predict that O VIII K, C VI K,
Fe XVII L, and Fe XVIII L lines will appear in the soft X-ray region of the
reflection spectrum, but are greatly blurred due to Compton scattering. The
equivalent width (EW) of O VIII K is estimated to be about 10 eV and seems to
be as strong as the blend of the Fe L lines. This result creates difficulty for
the claim of a strong relativistic O VIII line in the XMM-Newton grating
spectrum of MCG--6-30-15, although we can not strictly rule it out since
MCG--6-30-15 was in an anomalously low state during that observation. We find
that increasing the O abundance or breaking the continuum below 2 keV will not
significantly strengthen the line. The second Fe K line component in the
ionized disc model may arise from neutral reflection from a flared disc, or
from a second illumination event. The data cannot distinguish between the two
cases, and we conclude that single zone ionized disc models have difficulty
fitting these hard X-ray data of MCG--6-30-15.

survey indicates that the cluster disk fraction is initially very high (> 80%)
and rapidly decreases with increasing cluster age, such that half the stars
within the clusters lose their disks in < ~3 Myr. Moreover, these observations
yield an overall disk lifetime of ~ 6 Myr in the surveyed cluster sample. This
is the timescale for essentially all the stars in a cluster to lose their

a cosmological constant, the galaxy recedes from the observer as it joins the
Hubble flow, but in the previously favored cold dark matter model, the galaxy
approaches, passes through the observer, and joins the Hubble flow on the
opposite side of the sky. We show that this behavior is consistent with the
general relativistic idea that space is expanding and is determined by the
acceleration of the expansion of the universe -- not a force or drag associated

systematic temperature cycling experiments on both samples show important

temperature and a magnetic field on the conductivity. We explain the deviations
of the conductivity away from 2Ne^2/h in wires which are not too short as
arising from renormalization effects caused by the repulsive interactions. We
also explain the universal conductance corrections observed in different
channels at higher temperatures. We study the effects of an external magnetic
field on electronic transport through this system and explain why odd and even
spin split bands show different renormalizations from the universal conductance
values. We discuss the case of resonant transmission and of the possibility of
producing a spin-valve which only allows electrons of one value of the spin to
go through. We compare our results for the conductance corrections with
experimental observations. We also propose an experimental test of our model of
the contact regions.

a dynamical model of the continuum excitation of the projectile. The time
evolution of the projectile in coordinate space is described by solving the
three-dimensional time dependent Schroedinger equation, treating the
projectile-target (both Coulomb and nuclear) interaction as a time dependent
external perturbation. The pure Coulomb breakup dominates the relative energy
spectra of the fragments in the peak region, while the nuclear breakup is
important at higher relative energies. The coherent sum of the two
contributions provides a good overall description of the experimental spectra.
Cross sections of the first order perturbation theory are derived as a limit of
our dynamical model. The dynamical effects are found to be of the order of
10-15% for the beam energies in the range of 60 - 80 MeV/nucleon. A comparison
of our results with those of a post form distorted wave Born approximation
shows that the magnitudes of the higher order effects are dependent on the
theoretical model.

Numerical solutions that demonstrate the convergence and accuracy of the method

to obtain an accurate solution are also investigated. These calculations
demonstrate that this method can efficiently solve the large matrix equations

  Limit","5 pages, 4 figures; Submitted to PRA Rapid Communications",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.64.031403",,"physics.atom-ph",,"  We present a cooling method that should be generally applicable to atoms with
narrow optical transitions. This technique uses velocity-selective pulses to
drive atoms towards a zero-velocity dark state and then quenches the excited
state to increase the cooling rate. We demonstrate this technique of quenched
narrow-line cooling by reducing the 1-D temperature of a sample of neutral 40Ca
atoms. We velocity select and cool with the 1S0(4s2) to 3P1(4s4p) 657 nm
intercombination line and quench with the 3P1(4s4p) to 1S0(4s5s)
intercombination line at 553 nm, which increases the cooling rate eight-fold.
Limited only by available quenching laser power, we have transferred 18 % of
the atoms from our initial 2 mK velocity distribution and achieved temperatures
as low as 4 microK, corresponding to a vrms of 2.8 cm/s or 2 recoils at 657 nm.
This cooling technique, which is closely related to Raman cooling, can be
extended to three dimensions.

  and Simulation Results",,,,,"physics.comp-ph math.NA",,"  Sonoluminescence is the phenomena of light emission from a collapsing gas
bubble in a liquid. Theoretical explanations of this extreme energy focusing
are controversial and difficult to validate experimentally. We propose to use
molecular dynamics simulations of the collapsing gas bubble to clarify the
energy focusing mechanism, and provide insight into the mechanism of light
emission.
  In this paper, we model the interior of a collapsing noble gas bubble as a
hard sphere gas driven by a spherical piston boundary moving according to the
Rayleigh-Plesset equation. We also include a simple treatment of ionization
effects in the gas at high temperatures. By using fast, tree-based algorithms,
we can exactly follow the dynamics of million particle systems during the
collapse. Our results clearly show strong energy focusing within the bubble,
including the formation of shocks, strong ionization, and temperatures in the
range of 50,000---500,000 degrees Kelvin. Our calculations show that the
gas-liquid boundary interaction has a strong effect on the internal gas
dynamics. We also estimate the duration of the light pulse from our model,
which predicts that it scales linearly with the ambient bubble radius.
  As the number of particles in a physical sonoluminescing bubble is within the
foreseeable capability of molecular dynamics simulations we also propose that
fine scale sonoluminescence experiments can be viewed as excellent test
problems for advancing the art of molecular dynamics.

signals do not violate the principle of causality but they can shorten the
luminal vacuum time span between cause and effect. This amazing behaviour is
based on the property that any physical signal has a finite duration.
