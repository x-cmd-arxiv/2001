variable. Changes in the intensity by a factor of about 2 have been detected in
the ROSAT PSPC observations of RX J1334.2+3759 on time scales of 20000-40000s.
Rapid variability events have also been observed from RX J1334.2+3759. The most
extreme variable event has Delta L/Delta t = (1.95+/-1.02)E42 erg/s/s
corresponding to a change in intensity by a factor of about 4 within 400s. The
PSPC spectra of the NLQSO can be well represented by a power-law of photon
index 3.8, modified by an absorbing column local to the source over and above
that due to our own Galaxy. The intrinsic soft X-ray luminosity of RX
J1334.2+3759 is estimated to be 2.2E44 erg/s in the energy band of 0.1-2.0 keV.
The optical spectrum of RX J1334.2+3759 is typical of the NLS1 galaxies showing
strong Balmer Hbeta, Halpha, and forbidden line [O III]5007. Fe II multiplets,
usually present in the optical spectra of NLS1 galaxies, are also detected from
RX J1334.2+3759. Decomposition of the Hbeta and Halpha line profiles shows the
presence of narrow (FWHM = 880 km/s) and broad (FWHM = 2850 km/s) components in
the spectrum of RX J1334.2+3759. The narrow-line region of RX J1334.2+3759
appears to be significantly different from those of normal Seyfert galaxies. A
possible explanation for the observed properties of the narrow line region and
the broad line region is suggested in terms of density enhancements.

break (the so-called anisotropy break) in the outgoing spectra. The physical
parameters of the hot corona (i.e. the temperature and optical depth) obtained

different from those derived fitting the same data with the power law + cut-off

Comptonization models in slab geometry give a temperature generally much larger
and an optical depth much smaller than derived from the power law + cut-off
fits, using standard Comptonization formulae. The estimate of the reflection
normalization is also larger with the slab corona model. For most objects of
our sample, both models give Compton parameter values larger than expected in a

instabilities [MRI] may occur. Previous work has focused on the
Rayleigh-unstable regime. To prepare for an experimental study of MRI, which
are of intense astrophysical interest, we solve for global linear modes in a
wide gap with realistic dissipation coefficients. Exchange of stability appears
to occur through marginal modes. Velocity eigenfunctions of marginal modes are
nearly singular at conducting boundaries, but magnetic eigenfunctions are
smooth and obey a fourth-order differential equation in the inviscid limit. The
viscous marginal system is of tenth order; an eighth-order approximation
previously used for Rayleigh-unstable modes does not permit MRI. Peak growth
rates are insensitive to boundary conditions. They are predicted with
surprising accuracy by WKB methods even for the largest-scale mode. We conclude
that MRI is achievable under plausible experimental conditions using
easy-to-handle liquid metals such as gallium.

rates of significant jolts about 10^3 - 10^4 per Gyr. The steep source spectra

preferentially associated with merging systems as indicated by substructure in
the X-ray images and temperature maps. Since, however, many clusters without
radio halos also possess substructure, the role of mergers in the formation of
radio halos has remained unclear. By using power ratios to relate gravitational
potential fluctuations to substructure in X-ray images, we provide the first
quantitative comparison of the dynamical states of clusters possessing radio
halos. A correlation between the 1.4 GHz power (P_{1.4}) of the radio halo (or
relic) and the magnitude of the dipole power ratio (P_1/P_0) is discovered such
that approximately P_{1.4} ~ P_1/P_0; i.e., the strongest radio halos appear
only in those clusters currently experiencing the largest departures from a
virialized state. From additional consideration of a small number of highly
disturbed clusters without radio halos detected at 1.4 GHz, and recalling that
radio halos are more common in clusters with high X-ray luminosity (Giovannini,
Tordi, & Feretti), we argue that radio halos form preferentially in massive
(L_x >~ 0.5 x 10^{45} erg/s) clusters experiencing violent mergers (P_1/P_0 >~
0.5 x 10^{-4}) that have seriously disrupted the cluster core. The association
of radio halos with massive, large-P_1/P_0, core-disrupted clusters is able to
account for both the vital role of mergers in accelerating the relativistic
particles responsible for the radio emission as well as the rare occurrence of
radio halos in cluster samples.

investigation is based on an analytical model of the accretion luminosity at
emergence as a function of progenitor mass, coupled to the inferred rate of
observed Type II supernovae in nearby galaxies. We find through a parameter
survey that under optimistic assumptions the potential rate of observable
events can be as high as several per year. However, supernovae which produce
black holes are also likely to be low energy explosions and therefore
subluminous, as was the case for the best candidate to date, SN1997D. If black
hole-forming supernovae are underdetected owing to lower luminosities, the rate
of observing black hole emergence is probably not larger than once every few
years. We therefore emphasize the importance of dedicated searches for nearby
supernovae as well as faint supernovae projects for improving the prospects of

been modeled according to the available observations for quiet regions. The
question is addressed whether such heating events can provide the observed
average level of the coronal emission measure and thus of the observed flux of
extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray emission without contradicting the observed
average power spectrum of the emission measure, the typical emission measure
variations observed for individual pixels and the observed flare energy
distribution. As the assumed flare height influences the derived flare energy,
the mathematical foundations of nanoflare distributions and their conversion to
different height assumptions are studied first. This also allows a comparison
with various published energy distributions differing in height assumptions and
to relate the observations to the input parameters of the heating model. An
analytic evaluation of the power spectrum yields the relationship between the
average time profile of nanoflares (or microflares), assumed to be self-similar
in energy, and the power spectrum. We find that the power spectrum is very
sensitive to the chosen time profile of the flares. Models are found by
numerical simulation that fit all available observations. They are not unique
but severely constrained. We concentrate on a model with a flare height
proportional to the square root of the flare area. The existence of a fitting
model demonstrates that nanoflare heating of the corona is a viable and
attractive mechanism.

degenerate atomic orbitals by means of the density-matrix renormalization-group
method and obtained the ground-state phase diagrams. It was found that
ferromagnetism is stable from low to high (0< n < 1.75) electron density when
the interactions are sufficiently strong. Quasi-long-range order of triplet
superconductivity coexists with the ferromagnetic order for a strong Hund
coupling region, where the inter-orbital interaction U'-J is attractive. At
quarter-filling (n=1), the insulating ferromagnetic state appears accompanying
orbital quasi-long-range order. For low densities (n<1), ferromagnetism occurs
owing to the ferromagnetic exchange interaction caused by virtual hoppings of
electrons, the same as in the quarter-filled system. This comes from separation
of the charge and spin-orbital degrees of freedom in the strong coupling limit.
This ferromagnetism is fragile against variation of band structure. For high
densities (n>1), the phase diagram of the ferromagnetic phase is similar to
that obtained in infinite dimensions. In this case, the double exchange
mechanism is operative to stabilize the ferromagnetic order and this long-range
order is robust against variation of the band-dispersion. A partially polarized
state appears in the density region 1.68<n<1.75 and phase separation occurs for
n just below the half-filling (n=2).

transition amplitude. The W functions are scalar under four-dimensional
diffeomorphism, and fully gauge invariant. They capture the physical content of
the quantum gravitational theory. We show that W functions are the natural
n-point functions of the field theoretical formulation of the gravitational
spin foam models. They can be computed from a perturbation expansion, which can
be interpreted as a sum-over-four-geometries. Therefore the W functions bridge
between the canonical (loop) and the covariant (spinfoam) formulations of
quantum gravity. Following Wightman, the physical Hilbert space of the theory

live on a torus with the same Teichm\""uller parameter as the one that we
identified in string theory. We show explicitly that the thermodynamic
partition function of the Matrix string model in the limit of free strings
reproduces the genus 1 thermodynamic partition function of type IIA string.

insensitive of the non-abelian character of the theory and generalize

and the flux of incident cosmic rays. The effect of natural variations in the
cosmic ray flux is large, causing estimated changes in the Earth's energy
radiation balance that are comparable to those attributed to greenhouse gases
from the burning of fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution. However a
direct link between cosmic rays and cloud formation has not been unambiguously
established. We therefore propose to experimentally measure cloud (water
droplet) formation under controlled conditions in a test beam at CERN with a
CLOUD chamber, duplicating the conditions prevailing in the troposphere. These
data, which have never been previously obtained, will allow a detailed
understanding of the possible effects of cosmic rays on clouds and confirm, or
otherwise, a direct link between cosmic rays, global cloud cover and the
Earth's climate. The measurements will, in turn, allow more reliable
calculations to be made of the residual effect on global temperatures of the
burning of fossil fuels, an issue of profound importance to society.
Furthermore, light radio-isotope records indicate a correlation has existed
between global climate and the cosmic ray flux extending back over the present
inter-glacial and perhaps earlier. This suggests it may eventually become
possible to make long-term (10-1,000 year) predictions of changes in the
Earth's climate, provided a deeper understanding can be achieved of the
``geomagnetic climate'' of the Sun and Earth that modulates the cosmic-ray
flux.

system described by the Dirac equation. Its classical analog S_dc is described
by a system of ordinary differential equations, containing the quantum constant
h as a parameter. Dynamic equations for S_dc are determined by the Dirac
equation uniquely. Both dynamic systems S_D and S_dc appear to be
nonrelativistic. One succeeded in transforming nonrelativistic dynamic system
S_dc into relativistic one S_dcr. The dynamic system S_dcr appears to be a
two-particle structure (special case of a relativistic rotator). It explains
freely such properties of S_D as spin and magnetic moment, which are strange
for pointlike structure. The rigidity function f_r(a), describing rotational
part of total mass as a function of the radius $a$ of rotator, has been
calculated for S_dcr. For investigation of S_D and construction of S_dc one
uses new dynamic methods: dynamic quantization and dynamic disquantization.
These relativistic pure dynamic procedures do not use principles of quantum
mechanics (QM). They generalize and replace conventional quantization and
transition to classical approximation. Totality of these methods forms the
model conception of quantum phenomena (MCQP). Technique of MCQP is more subtle
and effective, than conventional methods of QM. MCQP relates to conventional
QM, much as the statistical physics relates to thermodynamics.

implementability (EI) means that the basic arithmetic operations are physically
implementable and the space-time and thermodynamic resources needed to carry
out the implementations are polynomial in the range of numbers considered.
Different models of numbers are described to show the independence of both EI
and the product state representation from the axioms. The relation between EI
and the product state representation is examined. It is seen that the condition
of a product state representation does not imply EI. Arguments used to refute
the converse implication, EI implies a product state representation, seem
reasonable; but they are not conclusive. Thus this implication remains an open
question.

in the language of weak values, and which is accessible experimentally via weak
measurements. Using as an illustration, a gedanken-experiment due to
Hardy\cite{hardy}, we show that there is in fact an exact numerical coincidence
between a) a pair of classically contradictory assertions about the locations
of an electron and a positron, and b) the results of weak measurements of their
location. The internal consistency of these results is due to the novel way by
which quantum mechanics ""resolves"" the paradox: first, by allowing for two
distinguishable manifestations of how the electron and positron can be at the
same location: either as single particles or as a pair; and secondly, by
allowing these properties to take either sign. In particular, we discuss the
