have been amplified to their present values by the turbulent dynamo inductive
action in the protogalactic and galactic medium. Up to now, in calculation of
the turbulent dynamo, it has been customary to assume that there is no the back
reaction of the magnetic field on the turbulence, as long as the magnetic
energy is less than the turbulent kinetic energy. This assumption leads to the
kinematic dynamo theory. However, the applicability of the kinematic dynamo
theory to protogalaxies is rather limited. The reason is that in protogalaxies
the temperature is very high, and the viscosity is dominated by ions. As the
magnetic field strength grows in time, the ion cyclotron time becomes shorter
than the ion collision time, and the plasma becomes strongly magnetized. As a
result, the ion viscosity becomes the Braginskii viscosity. Thus, in
protogalaxies the back reaction sets in much earlier, at field strengths much
lower than the energy equipartition field strengths, and the turbulent dynamo
becomes what we call the magnetized turbulent dynamo. The purpose of this
thesis is to lay the theoretical groundwork for the magnetized turbulent
dynamo. In particular, we predict that the magnetic energy growth rate in the
magnetized dynamo theory is up to ten time larger than that in the kinematic
dynamo theory. We also briefly discuss how the Braginskii viscosity can aid the
development of the inverse cascade of magnetic energy after the energy
equipartition time.

First, we describe the effects of radio-emitting plasmas or ``bubbles'',
inflated by active galactic nuclei, on the hot X-ray emitting gaseous
atmospheres in galaxies and clusters. We describe the interaction of the
``bubbles'' and the X-ray emitting gas as the buoyant bubbles rise through the
hot gas. Second, we describe sharp, edge-like surface brightness structures in
clusters. Chandra observations show that these features are not shock fronts as
was originally thought, but ``cold fronts'', most likely the boundaries of the
remaining cores of merger components. Finally, we present recent observations
of M86 and NGC507 which show similar sharp features around galaxies. For M86,
the sharp edge is the boundary between the galaxy's X-ray corona and the Virgo
cluster gas. The structures around NGC507, the central galaxy in a group, could
be relics of galaxy formation or may reflect the motion of NGC507 in the larger
potential of the group.

  cometary ions at 1 AU","32 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in Icarus",,"10.1006/icar.2001.6722",,"astro-ph",,"  A one dimensional sublimation model for cometary nuclei is used to derive
size limits for the nuclei of sungrazing comets, and to estimate oxygen ion
fluxes at 1 AU from their evaporation. Given that none of the ~300 sungrazers
detected by the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) was observed after
disappearing behind the sun, and that small nuclei with a radius of ~3.5m could
be observed, it is assumed that all SOHO sungrazers were completely destroyed.
For the case that sublimation alone is sufficient for destruction, the model
yields an upper size limit as a function of nuclear density, albedo and
perihelion distance. If the density of the nuclei is that typical of porous ice
(600kg/m^3), the maximum size is 63m. These results confirm similar model
calculations by Weissman (1983). An analytical expression is derived that
approximates the model results well. We discuss possible modifications of our
results by different disruption mechanisms. While disruption by thermal stress
does not change the upper size limits significantly, they may be somewhat
increased by tidal disruption (up to 100m for a density of 600kg/m^3) dependent
on the isotropy of the sublimation process and the tensile strength of the
comet. Implications for the Kreutz family of sungrazers are discussed.
  Oxygen ions from the sublimation of sungrazing comets form a tail. Fluxes
from this tail are sufficiently high to be measured at 1 AU by particle
detectors on spacecraft, but the duration of a tail crossing is only about half
an hour. Therefore the probability of a spacecraft actually encountering a tail
of an evaporating sungrazer is only of the order of two percent per year.

is derived from the measurement of the microlens parallax, and we are also able
to infer the angular Einstein radius (theta_E = 1.38 +/- 0.12 mas) from the
finite source effect on the light curve, combined with an estimate of the
angular size of the source given by the source position in a color-magnitude
diagram. The lens mass, M = 0.612 +/- 0.057 M_sun, is found by combining these
two quantities. This is the first time that parallax effects are detected for a
caustic-crossing event and also the first time that the lens mass degeneracy
has been completely broken through photometric monitoring alone. The
combination of the projected Einstein radius and the angular Einstein radius
also allows us to conclude that the lens lies in the near side of the disk,
within 2.6 kpc of the Sun, while the radial velocity measurement indicates that
the source is a Galactic bulge giant.

form, and how they contract and grow in mass via accretion from the surrounding
cloud material. Using numerical models of self-gravitating supersonic
turbulence, efficiency, spatial distribution and timescale of star formation in
turbulent interstellar clouds are estimated. Turbulence that is not
continuously replenished or that is driven on large scales leads to a rapid
formation of stars in a clustered mode, whereas interstellar turbulence that
carries most energy on small scales results in isolated star formation with low
efficiency. The clump mass spectrum for models of pure hydrodynamic turbulence
is steeper than the observed one, but gets close to it when gravity is
included. The mass spectrum of dense cores is log-normal for decaying and
large-wavelength turbulence, similar to the IMF, but is too flat in the case of
small-scale turbulence. The three-dimensional models of molecular cloud
fragmentation can be combined with dynamical pre-main sequence stellar
evolution calculations to obtain a consistent description of all phases of the
star formation process. First results are reported for a one solar mass

we have obtained the color distribution of the polarized flux. Some regions
have blue polarized flux, consistent with optically-thin dust scattering, but
some bright knots have a color similar to that of Seyfert 1 nucleus. Also, the
recent Chandra X-ray observation suggests that the ratio of scattered UV flux
to scattered X-ray flux is rather similar to the intrinsic UV/X-ray ratio in a
Seyfert 1 nucleus, if the observed extended X-ray continuum is scattered light.
While the scattered X-ray would be essentially from electron scattering, the UV
slope and UV/X-ray ratio both being similar to Seyfert 1's would lead to two
possibilities as to the nature of the UV scatterers. One is that the UV may
also be scattered by electrons, in which case the scattering gas is somehow
dust-free. The other is that the UV is scattered by dust grains, but the
wavelength-independent UV scattering with low efficiency indicated by the UV

competing models have been offered for this system. According to the first,
V1405 Aql is a triple system. The second model invokes the presence of an
accretion disc that precesses in the apsidal plane, suggesting that the shorter
period is the orbital period while the longer is a positive superhump.
Re-examination of previously published X-ray data on V1405 Aql reveals an
additional periodicity of 2979 s. The periods in V1405 Aql fit well within a
newly found relation where the ratio between the negative superhump deficit
(over the orbital period) and the positive superhump excess is a function of
orbital period in cataclysmic variables that show both types of superhumps.
Therefore, the 2979-s period is naturally interpreted as a negative superhump.
The recently found 4.8-d period in the X-ray light curve of V1405 Aql is
consequently understood as the precession of the accretion disc in the nodal
direction. This is the first firm detection of negative superhumps and nodal
precession in a LMXRB. Our results thus confirm the classification of V1405 Aql
as a permanent superhump system. The 13-year argument on the nature of this

of close encounters and mergers of two self-gravitating spherical galaxies. Two
models for encounting galaxies - Plummer's and Hernquist's - were used. The
number of particles ranged from 20000 to 50000 per galaxy. The changes of
central density, half-mass radius and central velocity dispersion were
analysed. It was found that close encounters between galaxies alter noticeably
the above parameters within a very short time interval (10^7 - 10^8 years) just
before the final merger. The amplitudes of parameter changes strongly depend on
the initial mass concentration of a model. In some experiments we considered an
encounter of two spherical galaxies with dark matter components. The effect of
parameter changes was less pronounced than for the experiments without a dark
halo. The results of the simulations were used to discuss the FP for
interacting early-type galaxies.

with the Russian SAO 6m telescope. While CIT 3 appears almost spherically
symmetric in the H- and K'-band, it is clearly elongated in the J-band along a
symmetry axis of position angle -28 degr. Two structures can be identified: a
compact elliptical core (eccentricity ~0.8) and a fainter north-western
fan-like structure (full opening angle ~40 degr). Extensive radiative transfer
calculations have been carried out and confronted with the spectral energy
distribution, our 1.24, 1.65 and 2.12 micron visibility functions, and 11micron
ISI interferometry. The best model refers to a cool central star (Teff=2250K)
surrounded by an optically thick dust shell (tau_V = 30). The central-star
diameter is 10.9mas and the inner dust shell diameter 71.9mas. The inner
dust-shell rim is located at r_1=6.6 Rstar and has a temperature of T_1=900K. A
two-component model existing of an inner uniform-outflow shell region
(rho~1/r^2; r < 20.5 r_1) and an outer region with rho ~ 1/r^1.5 proved to give
the best overall match of the observations. Provided the outflow velocity kept
constant, the more shallow density distribution in the outer shell indicates
that mass-loss has decreased with time in the past of CIT 3. Adopting
vexp=20km/s, the termination of that mass-loss decrease and the begin of the
uniform-outflow phase took place 87yr ago. The present-day mass-loss rate can
be determined to be Mdot = (1.3-2.1) x 10^-5 Msol/yr for d=500-800pc.

investigate the density of states Omega_N(E,M) of two- and three-dimensional
Ising models with N spins as a function of energy E and magnetization M. For a
fixed energy lower than a critical value E_{c,N} the density of states exhibits
two sharp maxima at $M = \pm M_{sp}(E)$ which define the microcanonical
spontaneous magnetization. An analysis of the form $M_{sp}(E) \propto
(E_{c,\infty}-E)^{\beta_\epsilon}$ yields very good results for the critical
exponent $\beta_\epsilon$, thus demonstrating that critical exponents can be
determined by analysing directly the density of states of finite systems.

We have established that with the electron density going to zero the Coulomb
interaction brings the arrangement of the Anderson localized electrons closer
and closer to an ideal (Wigner) crystal lattice, provided the temperature is
sufficiently low and the dimension of the system is > 1. The ordering occurs
despite the fact that a random spread of the energy levels of the localized
one-electron states, exceeding the mean Coulomb energy per electron, renders it
impossible the electrons to be self-localized due to their mutual Coulomb
repulsion This differs principally the Coulomb ordered Anderson localized
electron system (COALES) from Wigner crystal, Wigner glass, and any other
ordered electron or hole system that results from the Coulomb self-localization
of electrons/holes. The residual disorder inherent to COALES is found to bring
about a multi-valley ground-state degeneration akin to that in spin glass. With
the electron density increasing, COALES is revealed to turn into Wigner glass
or a glassy state of a Fermi-glass type depending on the width of the random
spread of the electron levels.

randomly oriented columnar defects (CD's) in a large number of HTS materials,

fission, and the recoiling fission fragments create amorphous tracks, i.e.,
CD's. The superconductive transition temperature Tc decreases linearly with
proton fluence and we analyze how the rate depends on the family of
superconductors. In a study of Tl-2212 materials, adding defects decreases the
equilibrium magnetization Meq(H) significantly in magnitude and changes its
field dependence; this result is modeled in terms of vortex pinning. Analysis
of the irreversible magnetization and its time dependence shows marked
increases in the persistent current density and effective pinning energy, and
leads to an estimate for the elementary attempt time for vortex hopping, tau ~

emulsions. The anomaly of (1) is eliminated if the two neutral pions in the
reactions p-bar p -> pi_0 pi_0 and p-bar d -> pi_0 pi_0 n are not identical.
Tsai-Chu et al. observed a second neutral pion that ``decays more rapidly into
electron pairs with larger opening angles and more frequently into double
pairs.'' One antineutron annihilation event produced three neutral particles
(each with a mass of 135 +/- 14 MeV), and each decayed into four electrons with
much wider opening angles than those of the internal conversion electrons seen
in pi-zero decays. The larger opening angles and much more frequent double pair
production could be caused by neutral pions with a lifetime so short that they
sometimes decay into photon pairs before they can leave the annihilation
nucleus (e.g., Ag) of the emulsion. We discuss several methods of searching for
this second neutral pion.

  6-8, 2001",,,"OCHA-PP-181","hep-ph",,"  A nonvanishing value for the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron is a
prominent signature for CP violation. The EDM induced by the Kobayashi-Maskawa
mechanism of the standard model (SM) has a small magnitude and its detection
will be very difficult. However, since baryon asymmetry of the universe cannot
be accounted for by the SM, there should exist some other source of CP
violation, which may generate a large magnitude for the EDM. One of the most
hopeful candidates for physics beyond the SM is the supersymmetric standard
model, which contains such sources of CP violation. This model suggests that
the EDM has a magnitude not much smaller than the present experimental bounds.
Progress in measuring the EDM provides very interesting information about
extension of the SM. ........

Fluctuations of isospin charge are considered in a thermal system at rest as
well as in a moving hadronic fluid at fixed proper time within a finite bin of
pseudo-rapidity. In the former case, we use general thermodynamic relations to
establish a connection between fluctuations and the space-like screening limit
of the retarded photon self-energy, which directly relates to the emissivities
of dileptons and photons. Effects of hadronic interactions are highlighted
through two illustrative calculations. In the latter case, we show that a
finite time scale $\tau$ inherent in the evolution of a heavy-ion collision
implies that equilibrium fluctuations involve both space-like and time-like
components of the photon self-energy in the system. Our study of non-thermal
effects, explored here through a stochastic treatment, shows that an early and
large fluctuation in isospin survives only if it is accompanied by a large
temperature fluctuation at freeze-out, an unlikely scenario in hadronic phases
with large heat capacity. We point out prospects for the future which include:
(1) A determination of the Debye mass of the system at the dilute freeze-out

algebras obtained by twisting finite supergroups by a twist lying entirely in
the odd part. These families are parametrized by data (G,V,u,B), where G is a
finite group, V its finite dimensional representation, u a central element of G
of order 2 acting by -1 on V, and B an element of S^2V. We fix the discrete
data G,V,u, and find the set of isomorphism classes of the members of the
family as Hopf algebras, in terms of the continuous parameter B. This set is
often infinite, which provides examples of nontrivial continuous families of
triangular Hopf algebras. The lowest dimension in which such a family occurs is
32, in which case we get 3 families which are dual to the 3 families of pointed
Hopf algebras of dimension 32 constructed recently by Grana. Furthermore, we
show that if (S^2V)^G=0 then such continuous families are nontrivial not only
up to a Hopf algebra isomorphism, but also up to twisting of the
multiplication. Thus, they provide counterexamples to Masuoka's weakened
Kaplansky's 10th conjecture, which claims that up to twisting, there are
finitely many types of Hopf algebras in each dimension. Finally, we study the
algebra structure of the duals of our families, and show they are direct sums
of Clifford algebras. Since there are finitely many types of Clifford algebras
in each dimension, this allows us to construct nontrivial families of rigid
tensor structures on the abelian category of modules over a finite dimensional
algebra, with a fixed Grothendieck ring.

presented in order to assess the self consistency of the Lambda-Lambda
hypernuclear binding-energy world data and the implied strength of the
Lambda-Lambda interaction, in the wake of recent experimental reports on
Lambda-Lambda-4H and Lambda-Lambda-6He. Using Gaussian soft-core simulations of
Nijmegen one-boson-exchange model interactions, the Nijmegen soft-core model
NSC97 simulations are found close to reproducing the recently reported binding
energy of Lambda-Lambda-6He, but not those of other species. For stranger
systems, Faddeev calculations of light Lambda-Xi hypernuclei, using a
simulation of the strongly attractive Lambda-Xi interactions due to the same
model, suggest that Lambda-Xi-6He marks the onset of nuclear stability for Xi
hyperons.

  130 GeV/nucleon Au+Au collisions at RHIC by making use of a hydrodynamical
model. We calculate the one-particle hadronic spectra and present the first
analysis of Bose-Einstein correlation functions based on the numerical solution
of the hydrodynamical equations which takes both longitudinal and transverse
expansion into account appropriately. The hydrodynamical model provides
excellent agreement with the experimental data in the pseudorapidity and the
transverse momentum spectra of charged hadrons, the rapidity dependence of
anti-proton to proton ratio, and almost consistent result for the pion
Bose-Einstein correlation functions. Our numerical solution with simple
freeze-out picture suggests the formation of the quark-gluon plasma with large
volume and low net-baryon density.

new Hamiltonian that contains slowly varying terms only. The formalism has been
applied to the dynamics of an intense beam propagating through a periodic
focusing lattice, and to the coherent beam-beam interaction. A stationary
solution to the transformed Vlasov equation has been obtained.

Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument, Bell's inequalities and of associated
experiments for spins in terms of positive operator valued measures.
Specifically, I will explore the relation between the
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality and a fundamental \emph{classicality}
property of observables -- their \emph{coexistence}. A derivation of Bell's
inequalities for unsharp spins will be given which follows a reconstruction by
Mittelstaedt and Stachow of the original EPR argument. In this context we
discuss the need for a consistent relativistic description of localised
measurements, carried out in spacelike separated regions of spacetime on
spatially extended, entangled systems.
