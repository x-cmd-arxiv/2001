X-ray bright, nearby neutron star RX J1856.5-3754. The nebula shows no strong
lines other than the Hydrogen Balmer lines and has a cometary-like morphology,
with the apex being approximately 1 arcsec ahead of the neutron star, and the
tail extending up to at least 25 arcsec behind it. We find that the current
observations can be satisfactorily accounted for by two different models. In
the first, the nebula is similar to ``Balmer-dominated'' cometary nebulae seen
around several radio pulsars, and is due to a bow shock in the ambient gas
arising from the supersonic motion of a neutron star with a relativistic wind.
In the second model, the nebula is an ionisation nebula, but of a type not
observed before (though expected to exist), in which the ionisation and heating
are very rapid compared to recombination and cooling. We use a detailed
hydrodynamical simulation to confirm that a shape like that observed can be
reproduced. Independent of the model, we find that RX J1856.5-3754 is not kept
hot by accretion. If it is young and cooling, the lack of pulsations at X-ray
wavelengths is puzzling. Using phenomenological arguments, we suggest that RX
J1856.5-3754 may have a relatively weak, few 10^11 G, magnetic field. If so, it
would be ironic that the two brightest nearby neutron stars, RX J1856.5-3754
and RX J0720.4-3125, may well represent the extreme ends of the neutron star
magnetic field distribution, one a weak field neutron star and another a
magnetar. [Abridged]

of 98 star-forming dwarf galaxies (SFDGs) from field- and low density
environments for companion galaxies. Most of the found companions are dwarf
galaxies, previously disregarded in environmental studies of SFDGs. Using a
subsample at low redshifts, cz < 2000 km/s, i.e. less biased against dwarf
companions, we find that 30% of the SFDGs have close companions within a
projected linear separation s_p < 100 kpc and a redshift difference of (Delta
cz) < 500 km/s. This fraction must be considered a lower limit, given the
incompleteness of the available data sets and the non-negligible frequency of
HI clouds in the vicinity of SFDGs, so that the majority of SFDGs should not be
considered isolated. The redshift differences between companion candidates and
sample SFDGs are typically smaller than ~250 km/s and concentrated towards
lower values. This is similarly observed for dwarf satellites of spiral
galaxies and suggests a physical association between the companion candidates
and the sample SFDGs. SFDGs with a close companion do not show significant

indicate that XTE J1906+09 is a transient X-ray pulsar and therefore likely has
a Be star companion. XTE J1906+09 was not detected with the RXTE All Sky
Monitor. Pulse timing analysis of the second outburst revealed a sinusoidal
signature in the pulse frequencies that is likely produced by periastron
passage in an orbit. Fits to pulse phases using an orbital model and quadratic
phase model have chi^2 minima at orbital periods of 26-30 days for fixed mass
functions of 5, 10, 15, and 20 M_sun. The pulse shape showed intensity and
energy dependent variations. Pulse phase spectroscopy was used to quantify the
energy dependent variations. The phase averaged spectrum, using the pulse
minimum spectrum as the background spectrum to eliminate effects from SGR

high energy cutoff. Estimated 2-10 keV peak fluxes, corrected for contributions

whose tipical linear size L increases in time. In one dimensional systems
coarsening is generally driven by an attractive interaction between domain
walls or kinks. This picture applies to growth models for which the largest
surface slope remains constant in time (model B): coarsening is known to be
logarithmic in the absence of noise (L(t)=log t) and to follow a power law
(L(t)=t^{1/3}) when noise is present. If surface slope increases indefinitely,
the deterministic equation looks like a modified Cahn-Hilliard equation: here
we study the late stage of coarsening through a linear stability analysis of
the stationary periodic configurations and through a direct numerical
integration. Analytical and numerical results agree with regard to the
conclusion that steepening of mounds makes deterministic coarsening faster: if
alpha is the exponent describing the steepening of the maximal slope M of
mounds (M^alpha = L) we find that L(t)=t^n: n is equal to 1/4 for 1<alpha<2 and
it decreases from 1/4 to 1/5 for alpha>2, according to n=alpha/(5*alpha -2). On
the other side, the numerical solution of the corresponding stochastic equation
clearly shows that in the presence of shot noise steepening of mounds makes
coarsening slower than in model B: L(t)=t^{1/4}, irrespectively of alpha.
Finally, the presence of a symmetry breaking term is shown not to modify the
coarsening law of model alpha=1, both in the absence and in the presence of
noise.

reach the other) of a PTA. Since a timed automaton can be treated as a PTA
without the pushdown stack, we can show that the binary reachability of a timed

results can be used to verify a class of properties containing linear relations
over both dense variables and unbounded discrete variables. The properties

although limited in what it can achieve has proved to be efficient and
effective.
  In the design of a security policy there is always a trade-off between
usability and security. Restricting access means that legitimate use of the
network is prevented; allowing access means illegitimate use may be allowed.
Static access list make finding a balance particularly stark -- we pay the
price of decreased security 100% of the time even if the benefit of increased
usability is only gained 1% of the time.
  Dynamic access lists would allow the rules to change for short periods of
time, and to allow local changes by non-experts. The network administrator can
set basic security guide-lines which allow certain basic services only. All
other services are restricted, but users are able to request temporary
exceptions in order to allow additional access to the network. These exceptions
are granted depending on the privileges of the user.
  This paper covers the following topics: (1) basic introduction to TCP/IP
filtering; (2) semantics for dynamic access lists and; (3) a proposed protocol
for allowing dynamic access; and (4) a method for representing access lists so
that dynamic update and look-up can be done efficiently performed.

for maximal neutrino mixing. We pay particular attention to an extension of the
Standard Model with three right-handed neutrino singlets in which we require
that the three lepton numbers L_e, L_\mu, and L_\tau be separately conserved in
the Yukawa couplings, but assume that they are softly broken by the Majorana
mass matrix M_R of the neutrino singlets. In this framework, where
lepton-number breaking occurs at a scale much higher than the electroweak
scale, deviations from family lepton number conservation are calculable, i.e.,
finite, and lepton mixing stems exclusively from M_R. We show that in this
framework either maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing or maximal solar neutrino
mixing or both can be imposed by invoking symmetries. In this way those maximal
mixings are stable against radiative corrections. The model which achieves
maximal (or nearly maximal) solar neutrino mixing assumes that there are two
different scales in M_R and that the lepton number \bar L = L_e - L_\mu -
L_\tau is conserved in between them. We work out the difference between this
model and the conventional scenario where (approximate) \bar L invariance is
imposed directly on the mass matrix of the light neutrinos.

established by formulating Einstein gravity with positive cosmological constant
in three dimensions as an SL(2,C) Chern-Simons theory. The de Sitter boundary
conditions on the connection are divided into two parts. The first part reduces
the CS action to a nonchiral SL(2,C) WZNW model, whereas the second provides
the constraints for a further reduction to Liouville theory, which lives on the

bottomia. A quarkonium system in thermal equilibrium with the medium can
dissociate by thermalization. The fraction of quarkonium lying above the
dissociation threshold increases as temperature increases. A quarkonium can
also dissociate by colliding with light hadrons. We evaluate the cross sections

above the spectral maximum have continued for the last three decades. In 1958
Phillips made a conjecture that wave breaking is the main mechanism responsible
for the spectrum formation (Phillips, 1958). That leads to the spectrum decay
$\sim \omega^{-5}$, where $\omega$ is the frequency of waves. There is a
contradiction between the numerous experimental data and this spectrum.
Experiments frequently show decay $\sim\omega^{-4}$ (Toba, 1973),(Donelan et
al, 1985), and (Hwang et al, 1999). There are several ways of the explanation
of this phenomenon. One of them (proposed by Banner (Banner, 1990)) takes into
account the Doppler effect due to surface circular currents generated by
underlying waves in the Phillips model.
  In this article the influence of the Doppler effect on an arbitrary averaged
spectrum is considered using both analytic and numerical approaches. Although
we mostly concentrated on the very important case of Phillips model the
developed technique and general formula can be used for the analysis of other
spectra.
  For the particular case of Phillips spectra we got analytic asymptotics in
the vicinity of spectral maximum and for high frequencies. Results were
obtained for two most important angular dependences of the spectra: isotropic
and strongly anisotropic. Together with the analytic investigation we performed
numerical calculations in a wide range of frequencies. Both high and low
frequency asymptotics are in very good agreement with the numerical results.
  It was shown that at least at low frequencies correction to the spectrum due
to the Doppler shift is negligible. At high frequencies there is an asymptotic
with tail $\sim \omega^{-3}$.

and detrended fluctuation analysis by comparing the group of patients with
stable angina pectoris without previous myocardial infarction with the group of
age-matched healthy controls. The fractal dimension of the R-R series was
determined using the rescaled range (R/S) analysis technique. To quantify
fractal longe-range-correlation properties of heart rate variability, the
detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) technique was used. The heart rate
variability was characterized by a scaling exponent $\alpha$, separately for
short-term ($<$ 11 beats), and for long-term ($>$ 11 beats) time scales. The
results of data sets show the existence of crossover phenomena between
short-time scales. The short-term fractal scaling exponent was significantly
lower in patients with stable angina pectoris.

few base pairs): in the adjustment regions near both ends of the paired region,
the tension is still mainly on one single strand. But in the central part, the
two backbones are equally loaded. This leads to a rupture force, increasing
linearly with length, and saturating for large lengths.
