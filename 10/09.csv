rapidly boiling matter off its surface. At any time its core could collapse
into a black hole, which may result in a gamma-ray burst (GRB) that can
devastate life on Earth. Auspiciously, recent observations indicate that the
GRBs are narrowly beamed in cones along the rotational axis of the progenitor
star. In the case of Eta Carinae the GRBs will not point to us, but will be
ravaging to life on planets in our galaxy that happen to lie within the two
beaming cones. The mean rate of massive life extinctions by jets from GRBs, per
life-supporting planet in galaxies like ours, is once in 100 million years,
comparable to the rate of major extinctions observed in the geological records
of our planet.

The threshold detection corresponds to about 20 A equivalent width with an
uncertainty of ~ 10 AA. Point-like objects (15) were excluded from our analysis
using CLASS_STAR parameter from SExtractor}. The contamination from other
emission lines such as O[II] 3727, H beta and [OIII] 4959,5007 at redshifts
1.2, 0.66 and 0.61 respectively is estimated, and found to be negligible at the
flux limits of our sample. We find an extinction-corrected H alpha luminosity
density of 5.4 10^39 erg s^{-1} Mpc^{-3}. This uncertainty takes into account
the photometric and Poissonian errors only. Assuming a constant relation
between the H alpha luminosity and star formation rate, the SFR density in the
covered volume is 0.043 M_sun yr^{-1} Mpc^{-3}. This translates to 0.037 M_sun
yr^{-1} Mpc^{-3} when the total density is corrected for the AGN contribution
as estimated in the local Universe. This value is a factor ~4 higher than the
local SFR density. This result needs to be confirmed by future spectroscopic

correlate with the mass ratio of the progenitor disks. We find that about 80%

significant minor-axis rotation. One half of all projected 1:1 remnants shows
boxy and the other half shows disky isophotes. Remnants with mass ratios of 3:1

90% of the projected 3:1 and 4:1 remnants show disky isophotes. 2:1 remnants
show intermediate properties. Projection effects lead to a large spread in the
data in good agreement with observations. They do not change the fundamental
kinematical differences between equal-mass and unequal-mass merger remnants.
The results of this study weaken the disk merger scenario as the possible
formation mechanism of massive boxy giant ellipticals. In general, the
properties of equal-mass (and 2:1) merger remnants are consistent with the
observed population of giant ellipticals in the intermediate mass regime
between low mass fast rotating disky and bright massive boxy giant ellipticals.
3:1 and 4:1 merger remnants, however, are in very good agreement with the class
of low luminosity, fast rotating giant elliptical galaxies. Binary mergers of
disk galaxies are therefore still very good candidates for being the main
formation mechanism for intermediate and low mass giant ellipticals. The
homogeneous class of massive boxy ellipticals most likely formed by a different
process.

somewhat lower temperatures than previous investigations. This allows a
substantial fraction of heavy nuclei to be present even in the inner parts of
the torus that forms around the central object and yields important
contributions to the neutrino opacity. The central object shows a rapid
differential rotation with periods of $\sim$ 2ms, which we suspect to stabilize
the central object on (at least) the simulation time scale against
gravitational collapse. The differential rotation could wind up initial
magnetic fields to $\sim 10^17$ G.

  Journal",,"10.1086/324778",,"astro-ph",,"  Using the exact solution of the axisymmetric pulsar magnetosphere derived in
a previous publication and the conservation laws of the associated MHD flow, we
show that the Lorentz factor of the outflowing plasma increases linearly with
distance from the light cylinder. Therefore, the ratio of the Poynting to
particle energy flux, generically referred to as $\sigma$, decreases inversely
proportional to distance, from a large value (typically $\gsim 10^4$)near the
light cylinder to $\s \simeq 1$ at a transistion distance $R_{\rm trans}$.
Beyond this distance the inertial effects of the outflowing plasma become
important and the magnetic field geometry must deviate from the almost
monopolar form it attains between $R_{lc}$ and $R_{\rm trans}$. We anticipate
that this is achieved by collimation of the poloidal field lines toward the
rotation axis, ensuring that the magnetic field pressure in the equatorial
region will fall-off faster than $1/R^2$ ($R$ being the cylindrical radius).
This leads both to a value $\s=\ss \ll 1$ at the nebular reverse shock at
distance $R_s$ ($R_s \gg R_{\rm trans}$) and to a component of the flow
perpendicular to the equatorial component, as required by observation. The
presence of the strong shock at $R = R_s$ allows for the efficient conversion
of kinetic energy into radiation. We speculate that the Crab pulsar is unique
in requiring $\ss \simeq 3 \times 10^{-3}$ because of its small translational
velocity, which allowed for the shock distance $R_s$ to grow to values $\gg
R_{\rm trans}$.

  We find that: (1) Single-cloud weak systems are optically thin in neutral
hydrogen and may have their origins in a population of objects distinct from
the optically thick strong MgII absorbers, which are associated with bright
galaxies. (2) Weak systems account for somewhere between 25% to 100% of the z <

have sizes of ~10 pc. At that size, to produce the observed redshift path
density, they would need to outnumber L* galaxies by approximately six orders
of magnitude.

require enrichment from Type Ia supernovae. Further, we address how star

decay phase of long and bright GRB pulses. Even though only a small fraction of
observed bursts exhibit such pulses, these are of interest to study as they
reflect individual emission episodes during the burst. We have previously found
that for about half of these decays, the instantaneous photon flux ~ 1/time,
which is a consequence of the validity of both a power-law hardness-intensity
correlation (HIC) and an exponential hardness-fluence correlation (HFC). Here,
we study a complete sample of 25 BATSE pulses (having a peak flux in 1 s
resolution of > 5 photons/s/cm^2 and a S/N of 30 in at least 8 time bins) and,
specifically, search for other types of decay behaviors. First, we find that a
power law gives a better description of the pulse decays than a stretched
exponential, the most commonly assumed pulse shape so far. Then we find that
about half of the decays behave approximately as 1/time, and the other half
approximately as 1/time^3. For a few of the latter decays, the two
correlations, the HIC and the HFC, are constrained and found to be consistent
with the light curve behavior. For these cases, the HIC is still a power law
while the HFC is described by a generalized function. Finally, we briefly
discuss our results in a physical context.

compute the maximum orbital frequency of stable circular motion around

calculations are performed for both normal and supramassive constant baryon
mass sequences of strange stars rotating at all possible rates. We find the

show that for slowly and moderately rotating strange stars the maximum value of
orbital frequency can be a good indicator of the mass of the compact object.
However, for rapidly rotating strange stars the same value of orbital frequency
in the innermost stable circular orbit is obtained for stars with masses
ranging from that of a planetoid to about three solar masses. At sufficiently
high rotation rates of the strange star, the rotational period alone constrains
the stellar mass to a surprisingly narrow range.

angular resolution of the data is 4.0x2.7 arcmin, and the rms noise of the

limb has encountered a dense HI filament (density ~12 cm^-3) at the same LSR

unusual HI feature aligned with a collimated outflow generated by the pulsar,
suggestive of association with the SNR. The anomalous kinematical velocity of
this feature (V_LSR ~ 15 km/s), however, is difficult to explain.

the Palomar and CfA bright Seyfert samples using the tight correlation between
black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion. Combining other 13 Seyfert 1s
and 2 Seyfert 2s in these samples but with black hole masses measured recently
by reverberation mapping and stellar/gas dynamics, we studied the correlations
of black hole masses with radio loudness and bulge luminosities for a sample of
37 Seyfert galaxies. We found that if radio-loudness is measured using the
optical and radio luminosities of the nuclear components, the black hole masses
of radio-loud Seyfert 1s tend to increase with the radio-loudness. The black
hole masses of all Seyfert galaxies increase with the radio power, but Seyfert
galaxies have larger radio powers than nearby galaxies with the same black hole
masses. In addition, the correlation between black hole masses and bulge V-band
luminosities for Seyfert galaxies is consistent with that found for quasars and
normal galaxies. The combined sample of 37 Seyfert galaxies, 15 quasars and 30
normal galaxies suggests a possible universal nonlinear relation between black
hole and bulge masses, $M(BH) \propto M(bulge)^{1.74\pm0.14}$, which is
slightly steeper than that found recently by Laor (2001) for a smaller sample.
This nonlinear relation is supported by a larger sample including 65 Seyfert
galaxies. The different M(BH)/M(bulge) ratio for galaxies with different bulge
luminosities or different black hole masses may be explained by this relation.
These results are consistent with some theoretical implications and are
important for understanding the nature of radio emissions and the formation and
evolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies.

equations of motion for condensate fluctuations in a weakly coupled plasma of
charged bosons at finite temperature. Analytic expressions are derived for the
first two infrared-divergent terms in both the momentum distribution of the
noncondensate and the anomalous Bose correlation function at low momenta.
Incorporation into the theory of the appropriate form of the Hugenholtz-Pines
relation for the chemical potential is needed to cancel an unphysical
divergence. Exact cancellation of infrared-divergent terms is demonstrated in
the HFB shift of the single-particle excitation energy away from the Bogoliubov
value at long wavelengths, with the residual terms raising it towards the
plasma frequency at low temperature. Numerical illustrations are presented for
a number of properties of the boson plasma as functions of temperature and
density in the weak-coupling regime: these are the chemical potential, the
condensate fraction, the normal and anomalous momentum distribution functions
and the corresponding one-body density matrices, and the dispersion relation of
single-particle excitations.

and slow time dependence, the vast majority of paths remain in small space-time
sets, typically in the neighbourhood of potential wells. The size of these sets
often has a power-law dependence on the small parameters, with universal
exponents. The overall probability of exceptional paths is exponentially small,
with an exponent also showing power-law behaviour. The results cover time spans
up to the maximal Kramers time of the system. We apply our method to three
phenomena characteristic for bistable systems: stochastic resonance, dynamical
hysteresis and bifurcation delay, where it yields precise bounds on transition
probabilities, and the distribution of hysteresis areas and first-exit times.

computational costs for PN waveforms: For a lower mass limit of a solar mass,
for LIGO-I noise, and with 3% maximum mismatch, the online computational speed
requirement for single detector is a few Gflops; for a two-detector network it
is hundreds of Gflops and for a three-detector network it is tens of Tflops.

one factor of the Riemannian 10j symbols appearing for each vertex, and simpler
factors for the edges and faces. We prove that these amplitudes are always
nonnegative for closed spin foams. As a corollary, all open spin foams going
between a fixed pair of spin networks have real amplitudes of the same sign.
This means one can use the Metropolis algorithm to compute expectation values
of observables in the Riemannian Barrett-Crane model, as in statistical
mechanics, even though this theory is based on a real-time (e^{iS}) rather than
imaginary-time (e^{-S}) path integral. Our proof uses the fact that when the
Riemannian 10j symbols are nonzero, their sign is positive or negative
depending on whether the sum of the ten spins is an integer or half-integer.
For the product of 10j symbols appearing in the amplitude for a closed spin
foam, these signs cancel. We conclude with some numerical evidence suggesting
that the Lorentzian 10j symbols are always nonnegative, which would imply
similar results for the Lorentzian Barrett-Crane model.

at zero and at finite temperatures. It is found that the continuum gauge field
has singularities originating from center degrees of freedom being discovered
in Landau gauge. Our numerical results show that the density of these
singularities properly extrapolates to a non-vanishing continuum limit. The
action density of the non-trivial Z_2 links is tentatively identified with the
gluon condensate. We find for temperatures larger than the deconfinement
temperature that the thermal fluctuations of the embedded Z_2 gauge theory
result in an increase of the gluon condensate with increasing temperature.

curved $C$-space is investigated. It is shown that the curvature in $C$-space
contains higher orders of the curvature in the underlying ordinary space. A
$C$-space is parametrized not only by 1-vector coordinates $x^\mu$ but also by
the 2-vector coordinates $\sigma^{\mu \nu}$, 3-vector coordinates $\sigma^{\mu
\nu \rho}$, etc., called also {\it holographic coordinates}, since they
describe the holographic projections of 1-lines, 2-loops, 3-loops, etc., onto
the coordinate planes. A remarkable relation between the ""area"" derivative $\p/
\p \sigma^{\mu \nu}$ and the curvature and torsion is found: if a scalar valued
quantity depends on the coordinates $\sigma^{\mu \nu}$ this indicates the
presence of torsion, and if a vector valued quantity depends so, this implies
non vanishing curvature. We argue that such a deeper understanding of the
$C$-space geometry is a prerequisite for a further development of this new
theory which in our opinion will lead us towards a natural and elegant
formulation of $M$-theory.

lithium isotopes, $^{6-11}$Li, which could be measured at RIKEN and other
nuclear facilities in the future. It is found that the light-cone momentum
distribution of the valence neutron in the halo of $^{11}$Li is very sharp and
symmetric around y = 1, because of the weak binding. The EMC ratios for Li
isotopes are then calculated. We study the possibility of extracting the
neutron structure function from data for the nuclear structure functions of the
Li isotopes. Next we calculate the spin-dependent structure functions of
$^{7,9,11}$Li isotopes, which have spin of 3/2. The effect of the nuclear
binding and Fermi motion on the multipole spin structure function,
$^{3/2}_{~1}g_1$, is about 10% in the region x < 0.7, but it becomes quite
important at large x. The spin structure function of $^{3/2}_{~3}g_1$ is also
investigated. Finally, we discuss the modification of the Gottfried and Bjorken
integrals in a nuclear medium and point out several candidates for a pair of
mirror nuclei to study the flavor-nonsinglet quark distributions in nuclei.

  figure",,"10.1017/S0022112002001842",,"physics.flu-dyn",,"  We use silicon strip detectors (originally developed for the CLEO III high
energy particle physics experiment) to measure fluid particle trajectories in
turbulence with temporal resolution of up to 70,000 frames per second. This
high frame rate allows the Kolmogorov time scale of a turbulent water flow to
be fully resolved for 140 <= R_lambda <= 970. Particle trajectories exhibiting
accelerations up to 16,000 m\s^2 (40 times the rms value) are routinely
observed. The probability density function of the acceleration is found to have
Reynolds number dependent stretched exponential tails. The moments of the
acceleration distribution are calculated. The scaling of the acceleration
component variance with the energy dissipation is found to be consistent with
the results for low Reynolds number direct numerical simulations, and with the
K41 based Heisenberg-Yaglom prediction for R_lambda >= 500. The acceleration
flatness is found to increase with Reynolds number, and to exceed 60 at
R_lambda = 970. The coupling of the acceleration to the large scale anisotropy
is found to be large at low Reynolds number and to decrease as the Reynolds
number increases, but to persist at all Reynolds numbers measured. The
dependence of the acceleration variance on the size and density of the tracer
particles is measured. The autocorrelation function of an acceleration
component is measured, and is found to scale with the Kolmogorov time tau_eta.

three-dimensional laser wakefield excited in a plasma channel. It is shown that
the bunch is trapped, effectively compressed both in longitudinal and
transverse directions and accelerated to ultra-relativistic energies in the
region of first accelerating maximum of the wakefield. The accelerated bunch
has sizes much less than the plasma wavelength and relatively small energy
spread.

ports with light generated by a single non-degenerate down-conversion source.
The strong quantum correlations of the light in conjunction with
boson-enhancement at the input beam splitter allow to detect a two- and
fourfold decrease in the observed de Broglie wavelength with perfect
visibility. This allows a reduction of the observed de Broglie wavelength below
the wavelength of the source.
