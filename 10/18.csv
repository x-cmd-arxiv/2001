Distribution (BBD) of galaxies. It is a combination of the classical Schechter
Function convolved with a Gaussian distribution in surface brightness: thus
incorporating the luminosity-surface brightness correlation as seen in many
recent datasets. We fit this function to a recent measurement of the BBD based
on 45,000 galaxies from the two-degree field Galaxy Redshift Survey (Cross et
al. 2001).
  Using a BBF we explore the impact of the limiting detection isophote on
classical measures of the galaxy luminosity distribution. If Gaussian corrected
magnitudes are used these change to $\Delta M^*_{b_j} \sim 0.38 $ mags, $\Delta
\phi^* \sim 11%$ and $\Delta \alpha < 0.01$ for $\mu_{lim,b_j}=24.0$ mag
arcsec$^{-2}$. Hence while the faint-end slope, $\alpha$, appears fairly robust
to surface brightness issues, both the $M^*$ and $\phi^*$ values are highly
dependent. The range over which these parameters were seen to vary is fully
consistent with the scatter in the published values, reproducing the range of
observed luminosity densities ($1.1<j_{b_j}<2.2\times10^8h L_{\odot}$Mpc$^{-3}$
see Cross et al. 2001). We conclude that surface brightness selection effects
are primarily responsible for this variation. After due consideration of these
effects, we derive a value of $j_{b_j}=2.16\times10^8h L_{\odot}$Mpc$^{-3}$.

expected at the faintest flux densities, is increased. In general, demagnified
sources are difficult to detect and study: exquisite subarcsecond angular
resolution and surface brightness sensitivity are required, and emission from
the lensing object must not dominate the image. These unusual conditions are
expected to be satisfied for observations of the dense swarm of demagnified

although the specifics of the perturbations are dependent upon the radius of
the planet relative to that of the star, the location of the planet over the
stellar surface and the orientation of the sweeping caustic. Given that the
instantaneous probability of transiting hot-Jupiter like planets is small, less
than a percent, and only a proportion of microlensing events exhibit caustic
crossing events, the probability of detecting a transiting planet during a
microlensing event is small, $\sim10^{-6}$. However, a number of factors
influencing this probability, such as the number of solar type star that
possess planets, are uncertain, and the prospect of detecting transiting
planets in future large catalogues of microlensing light curves may be viable.
The results of this study also have bearing on the gravitational microlensing

with progressively lower masses. A fit of the observed luminosity function to

The flatness of the mass function is consistent with models of the dynamical

fractional variation of the temperature of this radiation, is governed by the

adiabatic initial conditions, the classical Sachs-Wolfe effect is recovered,
provided the anisotropy of the overall expansion is small. This conclusion is
in agreement with previous work on the same anisotropic models where we found
that they may go through an `isotropization' process up to the point that the

with other physical parameters of the galaxies, such as ellipticity,
luminosity, and kinematic anisotropy. We demonstrate the existence of a galaxy
age-metallicity relation similar to that seen for local galactic disk stars,
whereby young galaxies have high metallicity, while old galaxies span a large

todays dwarf population relative to the giant population with increasing
redshift. Early-type galaxies are centrally concentrated, and dominate the core
region, implying that the radial gradient of early-type galaxies seen in local
clusters is already established at z ~ 0.5. Bright, late-type galaxies are
rare, consistent with a decrease in star formation in field galaxies as they
are accreted on to the cluster, while faint, blue galaxies are evenly
distributed across the cluster, except for a depletion in the core region. The
blue fraction is f_B ~ 0.15, which is somewhat lower than the Butcher-Oemler
average at z ~ 0.5. The value of f_B is found to increase with limiting
magnitude and with radius from the centre.

in the central black hole. This is fully in agreement with the recent results
in black hole demography, showing that virtually all luminous spheroidal

features in the double lobed SSRL quasar 3C 207 (z=0.684). These are: a diffuse
emission well correlated with the western radio lobe, a bright one sided jet
whose structure coincides with that of the eastern radio jet and an X-ray
source at the tip of the jet coincident with the hot spot of the eastern lobe.
The diffuse X-ray structure is best interpreted as inverse Compton (IC)
scattering of the IR photons from the nuclear source and provides direct
observational support to an earlier conjecture (Brunetti et al., 1997) that the
spectrum of the relativistic electrons in the lobes of radio galaxies extends
to much lower energies than those involved in the synchrotron radio emission.
The X-ray luminous and spatially resolved knot along the jet is of particular
interest: by combining VLA and {\it Chandra} data we show that a SSC model is
ruled out, while the X-ray spectrum and flux can be accounted for by the IC
scattering of the CMB photons (EIC) under the assumptions of a relatively
strong boosting and of an energy distribution of the relativistic electrons as
that expected from shock acceleration mechanisms. The X-ray properties of the
hot spot are consistent with a SSC model. In all cases we find that the
inferred magnetic field strength are lower, but close to the equipartition
values. The constraints on the energy distribution of the relativistic
electrons, imposed by the X-ray spectra of the observed features, are
discussed. To this aim we derive in the Appendices precise semi--analytic
formulae for the emissivities due to the SSC and EIC processes.

in these cases. The dimensionless parameters characterizing the laboratory jets

observe the formation of a network of active agents whose stability depends on
the rate at which activity diffuses in the system. The model exhibits a
non-equilibrium phase transition between the ordered phase, where a stable
network is generated, and a disordered phase characterized by the absence of
correlation among the agents. The ordered phase exhibits multi-modal
distributions of connectivity and activity, indicating a hierarchy of
interaction among different populations characterized by different degrees of
activity. This model may be used to study the hierarchy observed in social

that goes inversely proportianal to the probability $p$ of making a long range

in 3D polycrystalline thin films of InSb. The films are closely compensated
showing the electron concentration n>10^{16} cm^{-3} at the total concentration
of the donor and acceptor type structural defects >10^{18} cm^{-3}. Unless
Pb-doped, the InSb films do not show any measurable or show very small WL
effect at 4.2 K. The Pb-doping to the concentration of the order of 10^{18}
cm^{-3} leads to pronounced WL effects below 7 K. In particular, a clearly
manifested SO scattering is observed. From the comparison of the experimental
data on temperature dependence of the magnetoresistivity and sample resistance
with the WL theory, the temperature dependence of the phase destroying time is
determined. The determination is performed by fitting theoretical terms
obtained from Kawabata's theory to experimental data on magnetoresistance. It
is concluded that the dephasing process is connected to three separate
interaction processes. The first is due to the SO scatterings and is
characterized by temperature-independent relaxation time. The second is
associated with the electron-phonon interaction. The third dephasing process is
characterized by independent on temperature relaxation time tau_c. This
relaxation time is tentatively ascribed to inelastic scattering at extended
structural defects, like grain boundaries. The resulting time dephasing time
shows saturation in its temperature dependence. The temperature dependence of
the resistance of the InSb<Pb> films can be explained by the electron-electron
interaction for T<1 K, and by the WL effect for T>2 K.

biological variation upon which natural selection acts1. Some hypotheses
suggest that evolutionary change represents an adaptation to the surrounding

Elucidation of the origin and evolutionary relationship of species has been
complemented by nucleotide sequence and gene content analyses, with profound
implications for recognizing life's major domains. Understanding of
evolutionary relationships may be further expanded by comparing systemic
higher-level organization among species. Here we employ multivariate analyses
to evaluate the biochemical reaction pathways characterizing 43 species.
Comparison of the information transfer pathways of Archaea and Eukaryotes
indicates a close relationship between these domains. In addition, whereas
eukaryotic metabolic enzymes are primarily of bacterial origin, the
pathway-level organization of archaeal and eukaryotic metabolic networks is
more closely related. Our analyses therefore suggest that during the symbiotic
evolution of eukaryotes, incorporation of bacterial metabolic enzymes into the
proto-archaeal proteome was constrained by the host's pre-existing metabolic
architecture.

where the inverse correlation length kappa_z(T) and q are smaller than the
dipolar wavenumber q_d, we observe:(i) the static susceptibility of \delta
S_sw^T(q) displays the Goldstone divergence while for \delta S_z^T(q) the
Ornstein-Zernicke shape fits the data with a possible indication of a
thermal(mass-)renormalization at the smallest q-values, i.e. we find

identical with respect to the q^2-variation, the temperature independence and
the absolute magnitude. Due to the linear dispersion of the spin waves they
remain underdamped for q<q_d. These central results differ significantly from
the well known exchange dominated critical dynamics, but are quantitatively
explained in terms of dynamical scaling and existing data for T>=T_C. The

order of 0.5 pA/mm^2 at a bias voltage of 100 mV, which corresponds to a
dynamical resistance of ~ 3 10^5 ohms. When the array was illuminated by 6 keV
X-ray photons from a 55Fe radioactive source the single photon charge output
was found to be low and strongly dependent on the temperature of the devices.
This temperature dependence at X-ray energies can be explained by the existence
of a very large number of quasiparticle (QP) traps in the Vanadium. QPs are
confined in these traps, having a lower energy gap than the surrounding
material, and are therefore not available for tunneling. The number of traps
can be derived from the energy dependence of the responsivity of the devices
(charge output per electron volt of photon input energy).

originating from the longitudinal parts of gauge boson propagators, by virtue
of the elementary tree-level Ward identities they trigger, give rise to
effective vertices, which do not exist in the original Lagrangian; all such
vertices cancel diagrammatically inside physical quantities, such as current
correlation functions or S-matrix elements. We present two different, but
complementary derivations: First, we explicitly track down the aforementioned
cancellations inside two-loop diagrams, resorting to nothing more than basic
algebraic manipulations. Second, we present an absorptive derivation,
exploiting the unitarity of the S-matrix, and the Ward identities imposed on
tree-level and one-loop physical amplitudes by gauge invariance, in the case of
QED, or by the underlying Becchi-Rouet-Stora symmetry, in the case of QCD. The
propagator-like sub-amplitude defined by means of this latter construction
corresponds precisely to the imaginary parts of the effective self-energy
obtained in the former case; the real part may be obtained from a (twice
subtracted) dispersion relation. As in the one-loop case, the final two-loop
fermion self-energy constructed using either method coincides with the
conventional fermion self-energy computed in the Feynman gauge.

CP-violation and measuring the CKM mixing parameters in the Standard Model, the
short-distance penguin contribution with its absorptive part generated by charm
quark loop seems capable of producing sufficient $B \to K\pi$ decays rates, as
obtained in factorization and QCD-improved factorization models. However there
are also long-distance charming penguin contributions which also give rise to a
strong phase due to the rescattering $D^{*}D^{*} \to K\pi$ . In this talk, I
would like to discuss \cite{Isola} a recent work on the long-distance charming
penguin as a a different approach to the calculation of the penguin
contributions in $B \to K\pi$ decays from charmed meson intermediate states.
Using chiral effective Lagrangian for light and heavy mesons, corrected for
hard pion and kaon momenta, we show that the charming-penguin contributions
increase significantly the $B \to K\pi$ decays rates from its short-distance
contributions, giving results in better agreement with experimental data.

larger than the Planck or string scales, the dynamics of these extra dimensions

also illustrate that intuition on equilibrium and stability built up from
non-gravitational physics can be highly misleading. For all static, homogeneous
solutions satisfying the null energy condition, we show that the Ricci
curvature of space must be nonnegative in all directions. Much of our analysis
focuses on a class of spacetime models where space consists of a product of
homogeneous and isotropic geometries. A dimensional reduction of these models
is performed, and their stability to perturbations that preserve the spatial
symmetries is analyzed. We conclude that the only physically realistic examples
of classically stabilized large extra dimensions are those in which the
extra-dimensional manifold is positively curved.

cross sections of atoms. The problematic nonresonant contributions set a limit
to the accuracy to which atomic spectra determine energy levels. We discuss the
off-resonance effects in one-photon transitions. We also show that
off-resonance contributions for the 1S-2S two-photon transition in atomic
hydrogen are negligible at current and projected levels of experimental
accuracy. The possibility of a differential measurement for the detection of
off-resonance effects in one-photon transitions in atomic hydrogen is
discussed.

moment in the development of his philosophy of quantum theory, it is difficult
to find a clear statement of the reply's philosophical point. Moreover, some
have claimed that the point is simply that Bohr is a radical positivist. In
this paper, we show that such claims are unfounded. In particular, we give a
mathematically rigorous reconstruction of Bohr's reply to the \emph{original}
EPR argument that clarifies its logical structure, and which shows that it does
not rest on questionable philosophical assumptions. Rather, Bohr's reply is
dictated by his commitment to provide ""classical"" and ""objective"" descriptions
of experimental phenomena.

"quant-ph/0110108","John Klauder","John R. Klauder","The Current State of Coherent States","14 pages, TeX, no figures",,,,"quant-ph hep-th",,"  The original canonical coherent states could be defined in several ways. As
applications for other sets of coherent states arose, the rules of definition
were correspondingly changed. Among such rule changes were a change of group
and relaxation of the analytic nature of the labels. Recent developments have
done away with the group connections altogether and thereby allowed sets of
coherent states to be defined that are temporally stable for a wide variety of
dynamical systems including the hydrogen atom. This article outlines some of
the current trends in the definitions and properties of present-day coherent
states.

The experimental setup involves a stable reference state that undergoes an
unknown quantum transformation and is then revealed by balanced homodyne
detection. Through tomographic analysis on the homodyne data we are able to
characterize the signal and to estimate parameters of the interaction, such as
the loss of an optical component, or the gain of an amplifier. We present
experimental results for coherent signals, with application to the estimation
of losses introduced by simple optical components, and show how these results
can be extended to the characterization of more general optical devices.

this enhancement, which is due to additional avoided crossings in the level
structure of the system.
