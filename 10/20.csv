a fundamental feature of all current standard cosmological models. Examining
them in real space we note their characteristics to be a {\it negative} power
law tail \xi(r) \sim - r^{-4} and a {\it sub-poissonian} normalised variance in
spheres \sigma^2(R) \sim R^{-4} \ln R. We note in particular that this latter
behaviour is at the limit of the most rapid decay (\sim R^{-4}) of this
quantity possible for any stochastic distribution (continuous or discrete).
This very particular characteristic is usually obscured in cosmology by the use
of Gaussian spheres. In a simple classification of all SSP into three
categories, we highlight with the name ``super-homogeneous'' the properties of
the class to which models like this, with P(0)=0, belong. In statistical
physics language they are well described as glass-like. They do not have either
``scale-invariant'' features, in the sense of critical phenomena, nor fractal
properties. We illustrate their properties with some simple examples, in
particular that of a ``shuffled'' lattice.

Field South (CDFS), using the source catalog described in an accompanying paper

5.5e-17 erg/cm^2/s in the soft 0.5-2 keV band and 4.5e-16 erg/cm^2/s in the
hard 2-10 keV band. The hard band LogN-LogS shows a significant flattening
(slope~=0.6) below ~1e-14 erg/cm^2/s, leaving at most 10-15% of the X-ray
background (XRB) to be resolved, the main uncertainty lying in the measurement
of the total flux of the XRB. On the other hand, the analysis in the very hard
5-10 keV band reveals a relatively steep LogN-LogS (slope ~=1.3) down to 1e-15
erg/cm^2/s. Together with the evidence of a progressive flattening of the
average X-ray spectrum near the flux limit, this indicates that there is still
a non negligible population of faint hard sources to be discovered at energies
not well probed by Chandra, which possibly contribute to the 30 keV bump in the
spectrum of the XRB. We use optical redshifts and identifications, obtained
with the VLT, for one quarter of the sample to characterize the combined
optical and X-ray properties of the CDFS sample. Different source types are
well separated in a parameter space which includes X-ray luminosity, hardness
ratio and R-K color. Type II objects, while redder on average than the field
population, have colors which are consistent with being hosted by a range of
galaxy types. Type II AGN are mostly found at z<~1, in contrast with
predictions based on AGN population synthesis models, thus suggesting a
revision of their evolutionary parameters.

characteristics. In the models we resolve the transition from purely
hydrodynamic turbulence to gravitational collapse associated with the formation
and mass growth of protostellar cores. We compare models of driven and freely
decaying turbulence with and without magnetic fields. Self-gravitating
supersonic turbulence always produces a density structure that contains most
power on the smallest scales provided by collapsed cores as soon as local
collapse sets in. This is in contrast to non-self-gravitating hydrodynamic
turbulence where the Delta-variance is dominated by large scale structures. To
detect this effect in star-forming regions observations have to resolve the
high density contrast of protostellar cores with respect to their ambient
molecular cloud. Using the 3mm continuum map of a star-forming cluster in
Serpens we show that the dust emission traces the full density evolution. On
the contrary, the density range accessible by molecular line observations is
insufficient for this analysis. Only dust emission and dust extinction
observations are able to to determine the structural parameters of star-forming
clouds following the density evolution during the gravitational collapse.

the complicated morphology of the system indicated by previous observations,

shows a clear symmetry axis oriented at a position angle 150 degrees (N through

previously identified radio feature matches well with the overall extent of the
X-ray PWN, and propose the former as the long-sought radio nebula powered by
the pulsar. We further identify a bright collimated feature, at least 4' long,
lying along the nebula's main symmetry axis; we interpret this feature as a
physical outflow from the pulsar, and infer a velocity for this jet >0.2c. The
lack of any observed counter-jet implies that the pulsar spin axis is inclined
at approx 30 deg to the line-of-sight, contrary to previous estimates made from
lower-resolution data. We also identify a variety of compact features close to
the pulsar. A pair of semi-circular X-ray arcs lie 17 and 30 arcsec to the
north of the pulsar; the latter arc shows a highly-polarized radio counterpart.
We show that these features can be interpreted as ion-compression wisps in a

0.005, similar to that seen in the Crab Nebula. We further identify several

``overluminous'' [OIII] sources that are postulated to lie in front of M87: by
examining the composite spectrum of these objects, we show that the weaker
[OIII] line at lambda 4959 is definitely present at a strength ~ 1/3 that of

background emission-line objects by conducting a wide-field (0.13 deg^2) search
at lambda 5019 for faint emission line sources in a ``blank field'' located
well away from any galaxy or cluster. We show that the density of blank field
emission-line sources is significantly lower than the density of sources
detected between the galaxies of Virgo, but in good agreement with the density
of Ly-alpha galaxies found by Hu, Cowie, & McMahon(1998). The implication is
that background galaxies only account for ~20% of the planetary nebula

distances from the rotation axis, is determined through model calculations. The
core superfluid rotates at a different rate (faster, in young pulsars), while
spinning down at the same steady-state rate as the rest of the star, because of
the assumed pinning between the superfluid vortices and the superconductor
fluxoids. We find that the magnitude of this rotational lag changes with time
and also depends on the distance from the rotation axis; the core superfluid
supports an evolving pattern of differential rotation. We argue that the
predicted change of the lag might occur as discrete events which could result
in a sudden rise of the spin frequency of the crust of a neutron star, as is
observed at glitches in radio pulsars. This new possibility for the triggering
cause of glitches in radio pulsars is further supported by an estimate of the
total predicted excess angular momentum reservoir of the core superfluid. The

energy with the number of states kept for all models and parameter sets. In
contrast to the real-space algorithm, the accuracy becomes rapidly worse with
increasing interaction and is not significantly better at half filling. We
compare the results for different dispersion relations at fixed interaction
strength over bandwidth and find that extending the range of the hopping in one
dimension has little effect, but that changing the dimensionality from one to
two leads to lower accuracy at weak to moderate interaction strength. In the
one-dimensional models at half-filling, we also investigate the behavior of the
single-particle gap, the dispersion of spinon excitations, and the momentum
distribution function. For the single-particle gap, we find that proper
extrapolation in the number of states kept is important. For the spinon
dispersion, we find that good agreement with the exact forms can be achieved at
weak coupling if the large momentum-dependent finite-size effects are taken

to revive the ``no perpetuum mobile in equilibrium'' formulation of the second
law and to criticize some assumptions which are widespread in literature.
  The result puts recent results devoted to foundations and limitations of the
second law in proper perspective, and structurizes this relatively new field of
research.

electron dispersion near the Fermi energy. This kink coexists with a linear
frequency dependence of the imaginary part of the electron self-energy. In this
paper we show that both features could be accounted for if an electron-phonon
interaction is included in a model where the electrons are described by a
marginal Fermi liquid theory. Phonons provide the energy scale seen in the
experiments but the quasiparticle weight at the Fermi level is zero. At high
binding energy, in agreement with the experiment, the electron dispersion does
not go to the one-electron band.
  We analyze the compatibility between the electron scattering rate extracted
from ARPES experiment and the one extracted from transport properties. We
conclude that the electron-phonon interaction relevant for transport properties
is strongly screened respect to the one extracted from ARPES. This is in
agreement with recent studies in the context of 1/N expansion on t-J model.

velocity of the edge states and $\ell_{0}=\sqrt{\hbar c/|e|B}$ is the magnetic

lowest spin-up LL, which is occupied, compared to the lowest spin-down LL,
which is empty. The influence of many-body interactions on the spatially
inhomogeneous spin-splitting between the two lowest LLs is studied within the
generalized local density approximation. Temperature effects on the enhanced
spin-splitting, the position of the Fermi level within the exchange enhanced
gap and the renormalization of edge-states group velocity by edge states
screening are considered. It is shown that the maximum activation energy $G$ in
the bulk of the channel is determined by the gap between the Fermi level and
the bottom of the spin-down LL, because the gap between the Fermi level and the
spin-up LL is much larger. For the maximum value of $G$, it is shown that the

the condition of not-too-low $T$ can be satisfied for $4.2\agt T\agt0.3$ K. In

the framework of the representation theory of the q-deformed Poincare algebra.
An overview of the q-Lorentz algebra is given, including its representation
theory with explicit formulas for the q-Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The
vectorial form of the q-Lorentz algebra (Wess), the quantum double form
(Woronowicz), and the dual of the q-Lorentz group (Majid) are shown to be
essentially isomorphic. The construction of q-Minkowski space and the
q-Poincare algebra is reviewed. The q-Euclidean sub-algebra, generated by
rotations and translations, is studied in detail. The results allow for the
construction of the q-Pauli-Lubanski vector, which, in turn, is used to
determine the q-spin Casimir and the q-little algebras for both the massive and
the massless case. Irreducible spin representations of the q-Poincare algebra
are constructed in an angular momentum basis, accessible to physical
interpretation. It is shown how representations can be constructed,
alternatively, by the method of induction. Reducible representations by
q-Lorentz spinor wave functions are considered. Wave equations on these spaces
are found, demanding that the spaces of solutions reproduce the irreducible
representations. As generic examples the q-Dirac equation and the q-Maxwell
equations are computed explicitly and their uniqueness is shown.

nonequivalent legendrian links. Each component of the links considered is
legendrian isotopic to the 1-jet of the 0-function, and thus cannot be
distinguished by the classical rotation number or Thurston-Bennequin
invariants. The links are distinguished by calculating invariant polynomials
defined via homology groups associated to the links through the theory of
generating functions. The many calculations of these generating function
polynomials support the belief that these polynomials carry the same
information as a refined version of Chekanov's first order polynomials which
are defined via the theory of holomorphic curves.

  This paper proves a particular case of a conjecture of N. Kuhn. This
conjecture is as follows. Consider the Gabriel-Krull filtration of the category
U of unstable modules.
  Let U_n, n>=0, be the n-th step of this filtration. The category U is the
smallest thick sub-category that contains all sub-categories U_n and is stable
under colimit [L. Schwartz, Unstable modules over the Steenrod algebra and
Sullivan's fixed point set conjecture, Chicago Lectures in Mathematics Series
(1994)]. The category U_0 is the one of locally finite modules, i.e. the
modules that are direct limit of finite modules. The conjecture is as follows,
let X be a space then :
  * either H^*X is locally finite, * or H^*X does not belong to U_n, for all n.
  As an example the cohomology of a finite space, or of the loop space of a
finite space are always locally finite. On the other side the cohomology of the
classifying space of a finite group whose order is divisible by 2 does belong
to any sub-category U_n. One proves this conjecture, modulo the additional
hypothesis that all quotients of the nilpotent filtration are finitely
generated. This condition is used when applying N. Kuhn's reduction of the
problem. It is necessary to do it to be allowed to apply Lannes' theorem on the
cohomology of mapping spaces.[N. Kuhn, On topologically realizing modules over
the Steenrod algebra, Ann. of Math. 141 (1995) 321-347].

potential. At large momentum transfer q it exhibits \tilde{y} or equivalently
Nachtmann \xi scaling, and acquires a constant width independent of q. This
width has a contribution from the final state interactions of the struck
particle, which persists in the q->\infty limit. The width of the response
predicted using plane wave impulse approximation is smaller because of the
neglect of final state interactions in that approximation. However, the exact
response may be obtained by folding the approximate response with a function
representing final state interaction effects. We also study the response
obtained from the momentum distribution assuming that the particle is on the
energy shell both before and after being struck. Quantitative results are
presented for the special case of a linear confining potential. In this case
the response predicted with the on-shell approximation has correct values for
the total strength, mean energy and width, however its shape is wrong.

field and residual interaction are derived self-consistently from the Kohn-Sham
functional. SRPA drastically simplifies the computational effort which is
urgent if not decisive for deformed systems. The method is applied to the
description of dipole, quadrupole and octupole plasmons in deformed sodium
clusters of a moderate size. We demonstrate that, in clusters with the size
N>50, Landau damping successfully competes with deformation splitting and even
becomes decisive in forming the width and gross structure of the dipole
plasmon. Besides, the plasmon is generated by excitations from both ground
state and shape isomers. In such clusters familiar experimental estimates for
deformation splitting of dipole plasmon are useless.
