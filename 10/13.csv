both differential rotation and differential vorticity. Without the latter the
model reduces to the classical Shearing Sheet used in the description of spiral
density waves in astrophysical disks. Without the former it reduces to the
$\beta$-plane approximation, used in the description of Rossby waves.
  Retaining both, our model allows one in general to discuss the coupling
between density waves and Rossby waves, resulting in what is known as the
``corotation resonance'' for density waves.
  Here we derive, as a first application of this model, the properties of
Rossby waves in a differentially rotating disk. We find that their propagation
is quenched by differential rotation: after a limited number of oscillations, a
Rossby wave collapses to a singular vortex, as fluid elements are sheared apart
by differential rotation. In a keplerian disk, this number of oscillations is
always lower than one. We also describe how, in a similar manner, a vortex is
sheared in a very short time.

that continuum reddening (as measured by UV color) tends to increase with
inclination of the host galaxy. Furthermore, reddened, inclined Seyfert

dusty lukewarm absorbers. We suggest that these absorbers lie in the plane of

intergalactic medium, over the redshift range 4.9 < z < 6.1. After accounting
for sampling variance, we infer a sharp increase in Gamma from z~6.1 to z~5.8,
probably implying reionization at this redshift. We find a decrease in Gamma
from z~5.6 to 5.2, at 3sigma significance. This feature is a generic signature
in the aftermath of reionization, entirely consistent with the cosmological
reionization process being completed at z~6.1.
  This generic feature is a result of a significant change in the star
formation rate subsequent to the cosmological reionization. There is an abrupt
rise of the temperature of the intergalactic medium due to photo-heating, when
it is reionized. This translates to a correspondingly sudden jump in the Jeans
mass and a dramatic suppression of gas accretion onto the most abundant
(sub-galactic) halos at the epochs of interest. The star formation rate suffers
a temporary setback in the aftermath of reionization, resulting in a temporary
decrease in the amplitude of the ionizing radiation field.

The luminosity evolution of the entire BCG sample is not adequately described

detection as a proxy for cluster Lx and the suggestion by Burke, Collins, &
Mann, we set Lx = 2 x 10^{44} ergs/s to be the division between high and low
luminosity clusters. At high redshift (z>0.6) BCGs from low-Lx clusters are
fainter, on average, than those from high-Lx clusters and are best modeled as
having constant luminosity with redshift. The BCGs from high-Lx cluster are
best modeled as having a stellar population that formed at large redshift
(z_form > 5) and is passively evolving. However, for the entire BCG population,
the observed V-I and I-K' colors are well described by a single evolutionary
model in which the stellar populations have z_form > 5 and subsequently
passively evolve. We conclude that accretion is proportionally more significant
for BCGs in lower mass clusters at these redshifts (factor of 2 to 4 increase
in mass since z ~ 1 for the low Lx systems) and that the accreted matter is in
the form of systems with evolved stellar populations.

contribution to the cross-correlation comes from the secondary CMB fluctuation
field induced by the quadratic Doppler effects of the bulk velocity field $v$

designed, built and operated by a worldwide collaboration of equal partner
institutions, and which is remote from most of these institutions. The full
range of operation was considered including commi-ssioning, machine
development, maintenance, trouble shooting and repair. Experience from existing
accele-rators confirms that most of these activities are already performed
'remotely'. The large high-energy physics ex-periments and astronomy projects,
already involve inter-national collaborations of distant institutions. Based on
this experience, the prospects for a machine operated remotely from far sites
are encouraging. Experts from each laboratory would remain at their home
institution but continue to participate in the operation of the machine after
construction. Experts are required to be on site only during initial
commissioning and for par-ticularly difficult problems. Repairs require an
on-site non-expert maintenance crew. Most of the interventions can be made
without an expert and many of the rest resolved with remote assistance. There
appears to be no technical obstacle to controlling an accelerator from a
distance. The major challenge is to solve the complex management and
communication problems.

interest in studying models with a cosmological constant. We investigate
cosmological expansion (FRW metric) with $\Lambda>0$ for a general linear
equation of state $p=w\rho$, $w>-1$, so that the interplay between cosmological
vacuum and quintessence is allowed, as well.
  Four closed-form solutions (flat universe with any $w$, and $w=1/3$, $-1/3,
-2/3$) are given, of which the last one appears to be new. For the open
universe a simple relation between solutions with different parameters is
established: it turns out that a solution with some $w$ and (properly scaled)
$\Lambda$ is expressed algebraically via another solution with special
different values of these parameters.
  The expansion becomes exponential at large times, and the amplitude at the
exponent depends on the parameters. We study this dependence in detail,
deriving various representations for the amplitude in terms of integrals and
series. The closed-form solutions serve as benchmarks, and the solution
transformation property noted above serves as a useful tool. Among the results
obtained, one is that for the open universe with relatively small cosmological
constant the amplitude is independent of the equation of state. Also, estimates
of the cosmic age through the observable ratio $\Omega_\Lambda/\Omega_M$ and
parameter $w$ are given; when inverted, they provide an estimate of $w$, i. e.,
the state equation, through the known age of the universe.

consequence of existence of an extra non-compactified dimension. Recent
investigations in membrane and Kaluza-Klein theory indicate that when the
metric of the spacetime is allowed to depend on the extra coordinate, i.e., the
cilindricity condition is dropped, the equation describing the trajectory of a
particle in one lower dimension has an extra force with some abnormal
properties. Among them, a force term parallel to the four-velocity of the
particle and, what is perhaps more surprising,
  $u_{\mu}f^{\mu} \neq u^{\mu}f_{\mu}$. These properties violate basic concepts
in 4D physics. In this paper we argue that these abnormal properties are {\em
not} consequence of the extra dimension, but result from the formalism used. We
propose a new definition for the force, from the extra dimension, which is free
of any contradictions and consistent with usual 4D physics. We show, using
warp-products metrics, that this new definition is also more consistent with
our physical intuition. The effects of this force could be detected observing
objects moving with high speed, near black holes and/or in cosmological
situations.

Sleptons, neutralinos and gravitinos are particles predicted by the theory of
supersymmetry, and are the supersymmetric partners of the Standard Model
leptons, neutral bosons and of the graviton respectively. The search was
performed in 628 inverse picobarns of data taken by the ALEPH detector at LEP
centre-of-mass energies from 189 to 208 GeV. It was motivated by general
predictions of Gauge-Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (GMSB) models in which the
lightest supersymmetric particle is always the gravitino. No evidence of the
process was found. Model-independent cross-section limits are quoted as a
function of neutralino mass, slepton mass and slepton lifetime in the case that
the neutralino branching ratios to each slepton are equal at one third (the
so-called slepton co-NLSP scenario, where NLSP stands for `Next-to-Lightest

that in type IIA, a CP^1 of singularities and one unit of Ramond-Ramond (RR)

weaker than Bruno's one are introduced if one allows the linearization to be
less regular than the germ. This generalizes to dimension $n> 1$ some results

algebra $R$ in the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over the coradical
$A_{0} = \ku \Gamma$, $\Gamma$ the group of group-like elements of $A$, and
$\gr A \simeq R # A_{0}$. We call the braiding of the primitive elements of $R$
the infinitesimal braiding of $A$. If this braiding is of Cartan type
\cite{AS2}, then it is often possible to determine $R$, to show that $R$ is
generated as an algebra by its primitive elements and finally to compute all
deformations or liftings, that is pointed Hopf algebras such that $\gr A \simeq

we describe explicitly all finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebras $A$ with

essential nutrient limits their growth, and they must slow their entire rate of
biosynthesis. A major nutrient with a fluctuating abundance is nitrogen. The
growth rate of enteric bacteria under nitrogen-limiting conditions is known to
correlate with the internal concentration of free glutamine, the glutamine
pool. Here we compare the patterns of utilization of L-glutamine and
L-glutamate, the two central intermediates of nitrogen metabolism. Monomeric
precursors of all of the cell's macromolecules -- proteins, nucleic acids, and
surface polymers -- require the amide group of glutamine at the first dedicated
step of biosynthesis. This is the case even though only a minority (~12%) of
total cell nitrogen derives from glutamine. In contrast, the amino group of
glutamate, which provides the remainder of cell nitrogen, is generally required
late in biosynthetic pathways, e.g. in transaminase reactions for amino acid
synthesis. We propose that the pattern of glutamine dependence coordinates the
decrease in biosynthesis under conditions of nitrogen limitation. Hence, the
glutamine pool plays a global regulatory role in the cell.

is shown that in all legitimate cases, the evolution of $D_{1}$ states reduces
to the disentangled evolution of the component $D_{2}$ states. The
self-consistency conditions for the latter amount to conditions for
decoherence-free propagation, which complement the $D_{2}$ Davydov soliton
equations in such a way as to lift the nonlinearity of the evolution for the
on-site degrees of freedom. Although it cannot support Davydov solitons, the
coherent-product ansatz does provide a wide class of exact density-matrix
solutions for the joint evolution of the lattice and phonon bath in compatible
systems. Included are solutions for initial states given as a product of a

measurements. This technique relies on the use of a non-classical optical
source, namely, polarization-entangled twin photons generated by spontaneous
parametric down-conversion from a nonlinear crystal, in conjunction with a
coincidence-detection scheme. Ellipsometric measurements acquired with this
scheme are absolute; i.e., they do not require source and detector calibration.

"quant-ph/0110086","Alexandre Pechen","Luigi Accardi, Massimo Regoli","The EPR correlations and the chameleon effect","19 pages, LaTeX",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We describe an experiment in which two non communicating computers, starting
from a common input in the form of sequences of pseudo--random numbers in the
interval $[0,2\pi]$, and computing deterministic $\{\pm 1\}$--valued functions,
chosen at random and independently, produce sequences of numbers whose
correlations coincide with the EPR correlations and therefore violate Bell's
inequality.
  The experiment is the practical implementation of a mathematical model of a
classical, deterministic system whose initial state is chosen at random from
its state space, with a known initial probability distribution, and whose
dynamics exhibits the chameleon effect described below. Such a system satisfies
the constraints of pre--determination, locality, causality, local independent
choices, singlet law and reproduces the EPR correlations.
