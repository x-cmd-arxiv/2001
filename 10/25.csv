stellar nucleosynthesis and the data on a number of stars with -4<[Fe/H]<-3, a

distinct kinds of SNe II: the high-frequency SNe II(H) and the low-frequency
SNe II(L). We also consider that VMS were the dominant first-generation stars
formed from big bang debris. The yield patterns of Na to Ni for SNe II(H),
II(L), and Ia and VMS appear to be well defined. It is found that SNe II(H)
produce almost none of these elements, that SNe II(L) can account for the
entire solar inventory of Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, and V, and that compared with SNe
II(L), VMS underproduce Na, Al, V, Cr, and Mn, overproduce Co, but otherwise
have an almost identical yield pattern. A comparison is made between the yield
patterns determined here from the observational data and those from ab initio
models of nucleosynthesis in SNe II and VMS. The evolution of the other
elements relative to Fe is shown to involve three distinct stages, the earliest
of which is directly related to the problems of early aggregation and
dispersion of baryonic matter. It is argued that the VMS contributions should
represent the typical composition of dispersed baryonic matter in the universe.

mechanical heating arises from fluctuations produced by star-disk interactions
of the time dependent x-wind that are carried by the wind to large distances

model the time-averaged heating by the scale-free volumetric heating rate,
$\Gamma_{\rm mech} = \alpha \rho v^3 s^{-1}$, where $\rho$ and $v$ are the

an important ingredient of the theory; effects of the planet-induced surface
density perturbations on the migration speed are considered. A gap is assumed
to form when a stationary solution for the surface density profile is no longer
possible in the frame of reference migrating with the planet. An analytical
limit on the planetary mass necessary to open a gap in an inviscid disk is
derived. The critical mass turns out to be smaller than mass M_1 for which
planetary Hill's radius equals disk scaleheight by a factor of at least Q^{5/7}
(Q is the Toomre stability parameter) depending on the strength of the
migration feedback. In viscous disks the critical planetary mass could vary
from about 0.1M_1 to M_1, depending on the disk viscosity. This implies that a

which maximizes the stellar mass for any K-band luminosity at any redshift. We
take the mass-to-light ratio, M/L_K, of a Simple Stellar Population (SSP) which
is as old as the universe at the galaxy's redshift as a likely upper limit.
This is the most extreme case of pure luminosity evolution and in a more
realistic model M/L_K will probably decrease faster with redshift due to
increased star formation. We compute the number density of galaxies more
massive than 2 10^10 h^-2 solar masses, 5 10^10 h^-2 solar masses, and 1 10^11
h^-2 solar masses, finding that the integrated stellar mass function is roughly

radiative cooling and then also conversion of cold gas particles into stars.
When cold gas particles are allowed to convert into stars the final gas
profiles show a well defined core radius and the temperature profiles are
nearly flat. For the most massive test cluster in the LCDM model, these
simulations show a prominent cooling flow in the cluster core. This cluster was
analyzed in detail, running simulations with different star formation methods

that the results of simulations, based on star formation methods in which gas
conversion into stars is controlled by an efficiency parameter c_star, are
sensitive to the numerical resolution of the simulation. In this respect star
formation methods based instead on a local density threshold, as in Navarro and

five of the candidate companions at Keck and Gemini Observatories. The
resulting measurements of proper motions relative to the primary stars indicate
that these five sources are background stars. Given that the four primaries are
near the Galactic plane (|b|<6 deg), the remaining faint sources are also
likely to be background stars rather than substellar companions. We present the
companion detection limits for each target as a function of separation and
compare them to the sensitivities of radial velocity surveys, demonstrating the
complementary nature of the two techniques.

2597's ``ghost'' cavities are not coincident with the bright central radio

emission seen in a deep VLA radio map. We interpret the ghost cavities as
buoyantly-rising relics of a radio outburst that occurred between 50--100 Myr
ago. The demography of cavities in the few clusters studied thus far shows that
galactic radio sources experience recurrent outbursts on a $\sim 100$ Myr
timescale. Over the lifetime of a cluster, ghost cavities emerging from CDGs
deposit $\gae 10^{59-61}$ erg of energy into the intracluster medium. If a
significant fraction of this energy is deposited as magnetic field, it would
account for the high field strengths in the cooling flow regions of clusters.
The similarity between the central cooling time of the keV gas and the radio
cycling timescale suggests that feedback between cooling gas and the radio
source may be retarding or quenching the cooling flow.

continuum equilibrium model of a d-dimensional surface relaxing by linear
surface tension and linear surface diffusion, and which is subject to a lattice
potential favoring discrete values of the height variable. The model thus
interpolates between the overdamped sine-Gordon model and a related continuum
model of crystalline tensionless surfaces. The RG flow predicts the existence
of an equilibrium roughening transition only for d = 2 dimensional surfaces,
between a flat low-temperature phase and a rough high-temperature phase in the
Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) universality class. The surface is always in the flat
phase for any other substrate dimensions d > 2. For any value of d, the linear
surface diffusion mechanism is an irrelevant perturbation of the linear surface
tension mechanism, but may induce long crossovers within which the scaling
properties of the linear molecular-beam epitaxy equation are observed, thus
increasing the value of the sine-Gordon roughening temperature. This phenomenon
originates in the non-linear lattice potential, and is seen to occur even in
the absence of a bare surface tension term. An important consequence of this is
that a crystalline tensionless surface is asymptotically described at high
temperatures by the EW universality class.

(QWs) is developed for small concentrations of particles, $\rho_{\rm 2D}

while Bose-Einstein statistics already strongly influences the relaxation
processes at low temperatures. In this case thermalization of QW excitons
occurs through nonequilibrium states and is given by the following scenario.
During the first transient stage, which lasts a few characteristic scattering
times, the correlations with an initial distribution of QW excitons disappear.
The next, adiabatic stage of thermalization usually takes many characteristic
scattering times, depends only upon two control parameters, the lattice
temperature $T_b$ and the degeneracy temperature $T_0 \propto \rho_{\rm 2D}$,
and is characterized by a quasi-equilibrated distribution of high-energy QW
excitons with effective temperature $T(t)$. We show that the thermalization law
of high-energy particles is given by $\delta T(t) = T(t) - T_b \propto
e^{-\lambda_0 t}/t$, where $\lambda_0$ is a marginal value of the continuous
eigenvalue spectrum of the linearized kinetics. By analyzing the linearized

The second keeps only the abelian fields of monopoles in the MAG. The third
involves an additional gauge-fixing to the indirect maximal center gauge
(IMCG), followed by center projection to Z(3). At one gauge
fixing/configuration, the string tensions calculated from MAG U(1)xU(1), MAG
monopoles, and IMCG Z(3) are all less than the full SU(3) string tension. The
projected string tensions further decrease, by approximately 10%, when account
is taken of gauge ambiguities. Comparison is made with corresponding results
for SU(2). It is emphasized that the formulation of the MAG is more subtle for
SU(3) than for SU(2), and that the low string tensions may be caused by the
simple MAG form used. A generalized MAG for SU(3) is formulated.

introduced by Kitaev. In these codes, qubits are arranged in a two-dimensional
array on a surface of nontrivial topology, and encoded quantum operations are
associated with nontrivial homology cycles of the surface. We formulate
protocols for error recovery, and study the efficacy of these protocols. An
order-disorder phase transition occurs in this system at a nonzero critical
value of the error rate; if the error rate is below the critical value (the
accuracy threshold), encoded information can be protected arbitrarily well in
the limit of a large code block. This phase transition can be accurately
modeled by a three-dimensional Z_2 lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder.
We estimate the accuracy threshold, assuming that all quantum gates are local,
that qubits can be measured rapidly, and that polynomial-size classical
computations can be executed instantaneously. We also devise a robust recovery
procedure that does not require measurement or fast classical processing;
however for this procedure the quantum gates are local only if the qubits are
arranged in four or more spatial dimensions. We discuss procedures for
encoding, measurement, and performing fault-tolerant universal quantum
computation with surface codes, and argue that these codes provide a promising
framework for quantum computing architectures.

can be used for theoretically efficient quantum information processing. The
first of three steps toward efficient linear optics quantum computation (eLOQC)
was to design a simple non-deterministic gate, which upon post-selection based
on a measurement result implements a non-linear phase shift on one mode. Here a
computational strategy is given for finding non-deterministic gates for bosonic
qubits with helper photons. A more efficient conditional sign flip gate is
obtained.
