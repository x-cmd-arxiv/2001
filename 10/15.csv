measure (DM) data of nearby pulsars yield the strength of regular field as
1.8$\mu$G, with a pitch angle of about $8\degr$, and a bisymmetric spiral
structure. There are at least four, maybe five, field reversals from the Norma
arm to the outskirts of our Galaxy. In the thick disk or Galactic halo, large
scale toroidal magnetic fields, with opposite field directions in the Southern
and Northern Galaxy, have been revealed by the antisymmetric RM sky towards the
inner Galaxy. This signature of the A0 dynamo-mode field structure is
strengthened by the indication of a poloidal field of dipole form, that is the
transition of the RM signs probably shifted from $l\sim0\degr$ to
$l\sim+10\degr$. The local vertical field is probably a part of this dipole
field. The field structure of the A0 dynamo-mode strikingly continues towards
the region near the GC. In short, the magnetic fields in the Galactic disk have
a bisymmetric spiral structure of primordial nature, while in the halo and near
the GC the A0 dynamo seems to dominate, so that the fields consist of toroidal
fields with opposite directions below and above the Galactic plane and poloidal
fields of dipole form.

gravitational compression against the Fermi degeneracy pressure of the electron

a strong magnetic field can transform a boson into a fermion or a fermion into
a boson. In some condensed matter systems (e.g. fractional quantum Hall
systems) a strong magnetic field can transform electrons into effective
fermions, or effective anyons. Based on these examples we investigate the
possibility that the strong magnetic fields of some white dwarfs may transform
some fraction of the electrons into effective bosons. This could have
consequences for the structure of highly magnetized white dwarfs. It would
alter the mass-radius relationship, and in certain instances one could envision
a scenario where a white dwarf below the Chandrasekhar limit could nevertheless
collapse into a neutron star due to a weakening of the electron degeneracy
pressure. In addition the transformation of electrons into effective bosons
could result in the electrons Bose condensing, which could speed up the cooling
rate of white dwarfs.

L_x>10^{45} ergs/s. The clusters cover a relatively small range in redshift and
the data are homogeneous in terms of depth, resolution and rest wavelength
observed. We use GIM2D to fit the two dimensional surface brightness profiles
of galaxies down to M(702)<=-18.2 (Ho=50; roughly 0.01 L*) with parametric
models, and quantify their morphologies using the fractional bulge luminosity
(B/T). Within a single WFPC2 image we find that the Low-Lx clusters are
dominated by galaxies with low B/T (~0), while the High-Lx clusters are
dominated by galaxies with intermediate B/T (~0.4). We test whether this
difference could arise from a universal morphology-density relation due to
differences in the typical galaxy densities in the two samples. We find that
small differences in the B/T distributions of the two samples persist with
marginal statistical significance even when we restrict the comparison to
galaxies in environments with similar projected local galaxy densities. From
the correlations with the bulge and disk luminosity functions, we argue that
the global environment affects the population of bulges, over and above trends
seen with local density. We conclude that the destruction of disks through ram
pressure stripping or harassment is not solely responsible for the
morphology-density relation, and that bulge formation is less efficient in low
mass clusters.

perpendicular electric field. Two regimes are considered separately: weak
segregation and strong segregation. For weakly segregated blocks, below a
critical value of the field, E_c, surface interactions stabilize stacking of
lamellae in a direction parallel to the surfaces. Above the critical field, a
first-order phase transition occurs when lamellae in a direction perpendicular
to the confining surfaces (and parallel to the field) become stable. The film
morphology is then a superposition of parallel and perpendicular lamellae. In
contrast to Helfrich-Hurault instability for smectic liquid crystals, the mode
that gets critical first has the natural lamellar periodicity. In addition,
undulations of adjacent inter-material dividing surfaces are out-of-phase with
each other. For diblock copolymers in the strong segregation regime, we find
two critical fields E_1 and E_2>E_1. As the field is increased from zero above
E_1, the region in the middle of the film develops an orientation perpendicular

dispersionless mode of the lowest excitation appears in adequate sets of
$\alpha$ and $\delta$, indicating that the lowest excitation is localized
spatially and forms an isolated mode below the excitation continuum. We further
calculate the static structure factors. The largest intensity is located at
$q=\pi$ for small $\delta$ in fixed $\alpha$. With increasing $\delta$, the
wavenumber of the largest intensity shifts towards $q=\pi/2$, taking the
incommensurate value.

employing the {\it Self-Similar Approximation Theory}, which supplies the

three-quark effective theory, where only the u, d and s quarks enter and which
is known perturbatively to next-to-leading order, we calculate the lattice K
--> pi and K --> |0> matrix elements of dimension six, four-fermion operators.
Through lowest order chiral perturbation theory these yield K --> pi pi matrix
elements, which we then normalize to continuum values through a
non-perturbative renormalization technique. For the ratio of isospin amplitudes
|A_0|/|A_2| we find a value of $25.3 \pm 1.8$ (statistical error only) compared
to the experimental value of 22.2, with individual isospin amplitudes 10-20%
below the experimental values. For $\epe$, using known central values for
standard model parameters, we calculate $(-4.0 \pm 2.3) \times 10^{-4}$
(statistical error only) compared to the current experimental average of $(17.2
\pm 1.8) \times 10^{-4}$. Because we find a large cancellation between the I =
0 and I = 2 contributions to $\epe$, the result may be very sensitive to the
approximations employed. Among these are the use of: quenched QCD, lowest order
chiral perturbation theory and continuum perturbation theory below 1.3 GeV. We
have also calculated the kaon B parameter, B_K and find $B_{K,\bar{MS}}(2 {\rm

error, we have control over statistical errors and more simulations will yield

for fermion we use Dirac equation, for meson we use Klein-Gordon equation and
for classical particle we use Newtonian mechanics, while the connections

held in physics, i.e., only one physical formalism exists for any particle, we

found, the most important result is that the obstacles that cluttered the path
from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics are found, it becomes possible to
derive the quantum wave equations from relativistic mechanics after the
obstacles are removed. An improved model is proposed to gain a better

enormous advantages, not only for giving the first physically reasonable

about its behavior for large \Delta, about its overall behavior as a function

sine-Gordon equation in the presence of ac forces with harmonic mixing (at
least bi-harmonic) of zero mean is studied. The dependence of the kink mean
velocity on system parameters is investigated numerically and the results are
compared with a perturbation analysis based on a point particle representation
of the soliton. We find that first order perturbative calculations lead to
incomplete descriptions, due to the important role played by the soliton-phonon
interaction in establishing the phenomenon. The role played by the temporal
symmetry of the system in establishing soliton ratchets is also emphasized. In
particular, we show the existence of an asymmetric internal mode on the kink
profile which couples to the kink translational mode through the damping in the
system. Effective soliton transport is achieved when the internal mode and the
external force get phase locked. We find that for kinks driven by bi-harmonic
drivers consisting of the superposition of a fundamental driver with its first
odd harmonic, the transport arises only due to this {\it internal mode}
mechanism, while for bi-harmonic drivers with even harmonic superposition, also
a point-particle contribution to the drift velocity is present. The phenomenon
is robust enough to survive the presence of thermal noise in the system and can
lead to several interesting physical applications.

explained by an increased imaginary (mostly surface) part of the potential in

predict that gravitational radiation may also be employed for propulsion,
moreover the nonlinear behaviour of spacetime may permit the generation of
spacetime singularities with colliding beams of gravitational radiation, this
phenomenon could become a form of propellantless propulsion. Both applications
would require gravitational wave generators with high power and appropriate
optical properties. Among the proposed techniques that could be applicable to
the production of gravitational waves, a promising one is the possible emission
of gravitons by quantum systems. A hypothesis describing the production of

number of intercepted qubits collectively, including the collective unitary

that no coherent attack can be more powerful for this strategy for BB84

attacks for the strategy of maxmizing the information given the disturbance.
Suppose in a quantum key distribution(QKD) protocol, all the transmitted bits
from Alice are independent and only the individual disturbances to each qubits
are examined by Alice and Bob. For this type of protocols(so far almost all QKD
