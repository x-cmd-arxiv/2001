connection between the kinematics and the enhancement of certain

correlations were found between [X/Fe] and galactic rest-frame velocities
(\vrf{}) for Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca and Ni, with marginally significant
correlations existing for Ti and Y as well. We also find that the [X/Fe] ratios
for these elements all correlate with a similar level of significance with
[Na/Fe]. Finally, we compare the abundances of these halo stars against those
of stars in nearby dSph galaxies. We find significant differences between the
abundance ratios in the dSph stars and halo stars of similar metallicity. From
this result, it is unlikely that the halo stars in the solar neighborhood,
including even the ``$\alpha$-poor'' stars, were once members of disrupted dSph
galaxies similar to those studied to date.

lines frozen into the plasma turns out to be very useful. We present here a
method of introducing Lagrangian coordinates into relativistic MHD equations in
general relativity, which enables a convenient mathematical formulation for the
behaviour of flux tubes. With the introduction of these Lagrangian, so--called
``frozen--in'' coordinates, the relativistic MHD equations reduce to a set of
nonlinear 1D string equations, and the plasma may therefore be regarded as a
gas of nonlinear strings corresponding to flux tubes. Numerical simulation
shows that if such a tube/string falls into a Kerr black hole, then the leading
portion loses angular momentum and energy as the string brakes, and to
compensate for this loss, momentum and energy is radiated to infinity to
conserve energy and momentum for the tube. Inside the ergosphere the energy of
the leading part turns out to be negative after some time, and the rest of the
tube then gets energy from the hole. In our simulations most of the compensated
positive energy is also localized inside the ergosphere because the inward
speed of the plasma is approximately equal to the velocity of the MHD wave
which transports energy outside. Therefore, an additional physical process has
to be included which can remove energy from the ergophere. Magnetic
reconnection seems fills this role releasing Maxwellian stresses and producing
a relativistic jet.

extend the inertial subrange and to reduce the dissipative subrange. By
analogy, hyperdiffusivity (or hyperresistivity) is sometimes used in
magnetohydrodynamics. The underlying assumption is that only the small scales
are affected by this manipulation. In the present paper, possible side effects
on the evolution of the large scale magnetic field are investigated. It is
found that for turbulent flows with helicity, hyperdiffusivity causes the
dynamo-generated magnetic field to saturate at a higher level than normal
diffusivity. This result is successfully interpreted in terms of magnetic
helicity conservation, which also predicts that full saturation is only reached
after a time comparable to the large scale magnetic (hyper)diffusion time.

states localized near the center of a nanocrystallite and those near the

quantitative features are expected because of the different size constraints on
each of these states. Since the majority of atoms in a typical nanocrystallite

prove useful in predicting how surface state dependent properties, such as
optical absorption, change with the size of the nanocrystallite. By applying
first principles pseudopotential methods to indium doped, uncapped CdSe
nanocrystallites containing 17 and 34 atoms, we identify center and surface
localized states. Using the lowest occupied energy state as a reference, the
energy of a state localized near the center is found to increase 24 mRy from
the 34 to 17 atom nanocrystallite. An equivalent surface state within the two
cases studied is not found, but the energy level spacing is speculated to
increase on the order of 100 mRy between the 34 and 17 atom cases based on
states that are highly local to the surface, but not equivalent. Furthermore,

a sequence of rotational bands, i.e., for each such band the excitation
energies depend quadratically on the total spin quantum number. For
temperatures below 50 mK we predict that the magnetisation is described by a
staircase with 75 equidistant steps as the magnetic field is increased up to a
critical value and saturated for higher fields. For higher temperatures thermal
broadening effects wash out the staircase and yield a linear ramp below the
critical field, and this has been confirmed by our measurements (R.M.). We
demonstrate that the lowest two rotational bands are separated by an energy gap
of 0.7 meV, and this could be tested by EPR and inelastic neutron scattering
measurements. We also predict the occurrence of resonances at temperatures
below 0.1 K in the proton NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate associated with

For three neutron star models, we calculated the fundamental $r$-modes with
$l'=m=2$ and 3. We found that the oscillation frequency $\bar\sigma$ of the
fundamental $r$-mode is in a good approximation given by $\bar\sigma\approx
\kappa_0 \Omega$, where $\bar\sigma$ is defined in the corotating frame at the
spatial infinity, and $\Omega$ is the angular frequency of rotation of the

$\Omega$, but it strongly depends on the relativistic parameter $GM/c^2R$,
where $M$ and $R$ are the mass and the radius of the star. All the fundamental
$r$-modes with $l'=m$ computed in this study are discrete modes with distinct
regular eigenfunctions, and they all fall in the continuous part of the
frequency spectrum associated with Kojima's equation (Kojima 1998). These
relativistic $r$-modes are obtained by including the effects of rotation higher

a classical picture of coloured point particles. Within this formalism, kinetic
equations for the mean particle distribution, the mean fields and their
fluctuations are obtained using an ensemble-average in phase space. The
framework permits the integrating-out of fluctuations in a systematic manner.
This leads to the derivation of collision integrals, noise sources and
fluctuation-induced currents for the effective transport equations of QCD.
Consistency with the non-Abelian gauge symmetry is established, and systematic
approximation schemes are worked out. In particular, the approach is applicable
to both in- and out-of-equilibrium plasmas. The formalism is applied explicitly
to a hot and weakly coupled QCD plasma slightly out of equilibrium. The physics
related to Debye screening, Landau damping or colour conductivity is deduced in
a very simple manner. Effective transport equations are computed to first and
second order in moments of the fluctuations. To first order, they reproduce the
seminal hard-thermal-loop effective theory. To second order, the fluctuations
induce collisions amongst the quasi-particles, leading to a Langevin-type
transport equation. A complementary Langevin approach is discussed as well.
Finally, we show how the approach can be applied to dense quark matter systems.
In the normal phase, the corresponding kinetic equations lead to the

neutrinos with neutrino oscillation parameter LMA and small $\theta_{13}$. The
Earth effects show significant dependences on the neutrino path length inside

optimistically a possibility that we can probe the value of $\Delta m^{2}_{12}$
by the Earth effects. We assume that $\theta_{12}$ and the direction of the
supernova are known with enough accuracy and that the resonance that occurs at
higher density in supernova envelope is completely nonadiabatic. Further the
neutrino spectra before neutrinos go through the Earth are assumed to be known.
Then we show that making use of these dependences, we can obtain implication
for the value of $\Delta m^{2}_{12}$ by comparing the observed energy spectrum
to the predicted one. When SK detects neutrinos from supernova at 10kpc which
traveled through the Earth (nadir angle $<$ 80 degree), $\Delta m^{2}_{12}$ can
be determined with an accuracy of $\sim 10%$. In much of the

Heterotic string and the block structure of c=1 RCFT are derived from the point

TM(GT) theory are also studied through orbifolds of the bulk 3D space. This is
achieved by gauging discrete symmetries of the theory. Open and unoriented

symmetries. The important role of C symmetry to distinguish between Dirichlet
and Neumann boundary conditions is discussed in detail. Future directions of
research in this field are also suggested and discussed.

are then analogous to the particle horizons found in expanding models with a
pure AdS bulk. Since the branes in these models are stabilized by bulk scalar

no singularities in the bulk in which the four dimensional cosmological

of cellular flows in three different regimes: slow reaction, fast reaction and
geometrical optics limit. It is well known that a consequence of stirring is
the enhancement of front speed with respect to the non-stirred case. By means
of numerical simulations and theoretical arguments we describe the behavior of
front speed as a function of the stirring intensity, $U$. For slow reaction,
the front propagates with a speed proportional to $U^{1/4}$, conversely for
fast reaction the front speed is proportional to $U^{3/4}$. In the geometrical
optics limit, the front speed asymptotically behaves as $U/\ln U$.

Its usage of 1000 metric tons of D$_{2}$O as target allows the SNO detector to
make a solar-model independent test of the neutrino oscillation hypothesis by
simultaneously measuring the solar $\nu_{e}$ flux and the total flux of all
active neutrino species. Solar neutrinos from the decay of $^{8}$B have been
detected at SNO by the charged-current (CC) interaction on the deuteron and by
the elastic scattering (ES) of electrons. While the CC reaction is sensitive
exclusively to $\nu_{e}$, the ES reaction also has a small sensitivity to
$\nu_{\mu}$ and $\nu_{\tau}$. In this paper, recent solar neutrino results from
the SNO experiment are presented. It is demonstrated that the solar flux from
$^{8}$B decay as measured from the ES reaction rate under the no-oscillation
assumption is consistent with the high precision ES measurement by the
Super-Kamiokande experiment. The $\nu_{e}$ flux deduced from the CC reaction
rate in SNO differs from the Super-Kamiokande ES results by 3.3$sigma$. This is
evidence for an active neutrino component, in additional to $\nu_{e}$, in the
solar neutrino flux. These results also allow the first experimental
determination of the total active $^{8}$B neutrino flux from the Sun, and is
found to be in good agreement with solar model predictions.
