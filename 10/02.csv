the nature of their progenitors and the geometry of explosion. Evidence is
presented for two types of progenitors. The radio afterglow of GRB 980425/SN
1998bw and the multi-frequency observations of GRB 970508 can be fitted by a
blast wave expanding into a wind-type medium, pointing to a massive star
progenitor. The broadband afterglow data of GRBs 990123 and 990510 are better
modeled by a jet expanding into a constant-density medium, implying a compact
star merger origin. Among other well observed GRBs, the jet model appears to be
more widely applicable than the wind model, although some cases are ambiguous.
The model fits often require a deviation of the energy distribution of the
radiating electrons from the commonly assumed single power-law form,
particularly for sources with a rapid decline and/or pronounced steepening in
the optical light curves. Transition to non-relativistic evolution has been
suggested as an alternative explanation for the light curve steepening,
although to produce steepening on the order of days or less would require very
high ambient densities, which are generally difficult to reconcile with radio
observations. Major open issues include the hydrodynamics of jet-ambient medium
interaction, a self-consistent determination of the electron energy
distribution, and the effects of pair production on the early afterglows which
are expected to be particularly large for the wind interaction model.

parameters. First of all the Gibbs photon availability, which is a star-orbit
parameter and is the input for the upper branch. Then follows the energy
cascade that develops along the organic web with a large number of interactions

in the emission regions of the LMXB X1624-490 during strong flaring in RXTE

consists of a superposition of X-ray bursts. It is shown that major changes
take place in the blackbody emission component, the temperature kT_BB
increasing to ~2.2 keV in flaring. Remarkably, the blackbody area decreases by
a factor of ~5 in flaring. During flare evolution, the blackbody luminosity
remains approximately constant, constituting a previously unknown Eddington
limiting effect which we propose is due to radiation pressure of the blackbody
as kT_BB increases affecting the inner disk or accretion flow resulting in a
decreased emitting area on the star. We argue that the large decrease in area
cannot be explained in terms of modification of the blackbody spectrum by
electron scattering in the atmosphere of the neutron star. The height of the
emitting region on the non-flaring neutron star is shown to agree with the
height of the inner radiatively-supported disk as found for sources in the ASCA
survey of LMXB of Church & Balucinska-Church (2001). The decrease in height
during flaring is discussed in terms of possible models, including radial
accretion flow onto the stellar surface and the theory of accretion flow
spreading on the neutron star surface of Inogamov & Sunyaev (1999). We
demonstrate that the intensity of the broad iron line at 6.4 keV is strongly
correlated with the luminosity of the blackbody emission from the neutron star,
and discuss the probable origin of this line in the ADC. Finally, possible
reasons for non-detection of a reflection component in this source, and LMXB in

flows of charged particles, causes a large electric field along the magnetic
field lines. Migratory electrons and/or positrons are accelerated by this field
to radiate curvature gamma-rays, some of which collide with the X-rays to
materialize as pairs in the gap. The replenished charges partially screen the
electric field, which is self-consistently solved, together with the
distribution functions of particles and gamma-rays. By solving the Vlasov
equations describing this pair production cascade, we demonstrate the existence
of a stationary gap in the outer magnetosphere of PSR B1055-52 for a wide range
of current densities flowing in the accelerator: From sub to super
Goldreich-Julian values. However, we find that the expected GeV spectrum
becomes very soft if the current density exceeds the Goldreich-Julian value. We
also demonstrate that the GeV spectrum softens with decreasing magnetic
inclination and with increasing distance to this pulsar. We thus conclude that
a sub-Goldreich-Julian current, a large magnetic inclination, and a small
distance (500 pc, say) are plausible to account for EGRET observations.
Furthermore, it is found that the TeV flux due to inverse Compton scatterings
of infrared photons whose spectrum is inferred from the Rayleigh-Jeans side of

stellar absorption technique, and more than a dozen have abundance
measurements. In addition, twenty or more HVCs have been detected in H-alpha
(and a few in optical forbidden lines). Over the past five years, we have been
developing a model of the halo radiation field which includes contributions
from the stellar disk, the stellar bulge, the hot corona, and the Magellanic
Clouds. In certain instances, the H-alpha flux from an opaque HI cloud can be
used to derive a crude distance constraint to the cloud. For a UV escape
fraction of f_esc ~ 6% perpendicular to the disk (f_esc ~ 1-2% when averaged
over solid angle), the HVCs appear to be broadly consistent with the spiral arm
model. We caution that a larger database with full sky coverage is required
before the usefulness of H-alpha distances can be fully assessed. We present a
number of detailed predictions from our distance frame to encourage independent
assessments from future observations. If the model is valid, we find that most
HVCs detected to date are scattered throughout the halo up to distances of 50
kpc from the Sun. Most of this material is likely to be debris from recent
galaxy interactions, or even debris dislodged from the outer Galaxy disk. We

hours and ~468 days after the event. An unusually bright optical afterglow (OA)
was seen to decline following a steep power law decay with index alpha = -2.03
+/- 0.11, possibly indicating a break in the light curve at t - to < 3.5 days,
as found in other bursts. Upper limits imposed by the LOTIS alerting system
6.14 hours after the gamma ray event provide tentative (1.2 sigma) evidence for
a break in the optical light curve. The spectral index beta of the OA yields
-1.24 +/- 0.57. These values may be explained both by several fireball jet
models and by the cannonball model. Fireball spherical expansion models are not
favoured. Late epoch deep imaging revealed the presence of a complex host
galaxy system, composed of at least two objects located 1.2"" (1.7 sigma) and
1.9"" (2.7 sigma) from the afterglow position.

collapse is in agreement with previous ammonia observations of the 20 solar
mass core, which is embedded within the CS structure. However, we cannot
discard that the ring structure is expanding driven by protostellar winds, if
the CS abundance if unusually high and the CO momentum rate is much higher than

the molecular outflow and of the dense core suggest that it harbors a Class 0

appropriate adjustments of other parameters such as the galaxy metallicities
and star-formation histories are made. Without such modifications, even after
accounting for stellar evolution, the high redshift radio galaxies are more
luminous (ie. more massive) than those nearby in models with finite
OmegaLambda, including the favoured model with Omega=0.3, OmegaLambda=0.7. For

unstable to non-axisymmetric disturbances. This instability is present in any
stably stratified anticyclonically sheared flow as soon as the angular velocity
decreases outwards. In the large Froude number limit, the maximal growth rate
is proportional to the angular rotation velocity, and is independent of the
stratification. In the low Froude number limit, it decreases like the inverse
of the Froude number, thereby vanishing for unstratified, centrigugally stable
flows. The instability is not sensitive to disk boundaries. We discuss the
possible significance of our result, and its implications on the turbulent
state achieved by the disks. We conclude that this linear instability is one of
the best candidates for the source of turbulence in geometrically thin disks,
and that magnetic fields can be safely ignored when studying their turbulent
state. The relevance of the instability for thick disks or nearly neutrally
stratified disks remains to be explored.

of semantic networks: word associations, WordNet, and Roget's thesaurus. We
show that they have a small-world structure, characterized by sparse
connectivity, short average path-lengths between words, and strong local
clustering. In addition, the distributions of the number of connections follow
power laws that indicate a scale-free pattern of connectivity, with most nodes
having relatively few connections joined together through a small number of
hubs with many connections. These regularities have also been found in certain
other complex natural networks, such as the world wide web, but they are not
consistent with many conventional models of semantic organization, based on
inheritance hierarchies, arbitrarily structured networks, or high-dimensional
vector spaces. We propose that these structures reflect the mechanisms by which
semantic networks grow. We describe a simple model for semantic growth, in
which each new word or concept is connected to an existing network by
differentiating the connectivity pattern of an existing node. This model
generates appropriate small-world statistics and power-law connectivity
distributions, and also suggests one possible mechanistic basis for the effects

fractal analysis of experimental profiles is of critical importance. Although
this aspect has been widely recognized, a systematic analysis of the sampling
influence is still lacking. Here we present the results of a systematic
analysis of synthetic self-affine profiles in order to clarify the consequences
of the application of a poor sampling (up to 1000 points) typical of Scanning
Probe Microscopy for the characterization of real interfaces and surfaces. We
interprete our results in term of a deviation and a dispersion of the measured
exponent with respect to the ``true'' one. Both the deviation and the
dispersion have always been disregarded in the experimental literature, and
this can be very misleading if results obtained from poorly sampled images are
presented. We provide reasonable arguments to assess the universality of these
effects and we propose an empirical method to take them into account. We show
that it is possible to correct the deviation of the measured Hurst exponent
from the 'true' one and give a reasonable estimate of the dispersion error. The
last estimate is particularly important in the experimental results since it is
an intrinsic error that depends only on the number of sampling points and can
easily overwhelm the statistical error. Finally, we test our empirical method
calculating the Hurst exponent for the well-known 1+1 dimensional directed
percolation profiles, with a 512-point sampling.

is evidence that the empirical power laws which relate the size of an

in the economy .Biological species interact with each other in ways which
either increase or decrease the fitness levels of individual species. In the
same way, firms in the economy carry out strategies, and the net outcome of the
interactions between firms is to increase or decrease the fitness of other
firms.. Models which are used to describe the interactions of biological
species can be given straightforward interpretations in terms of the
interactions of firms in an industry. The general versions of models of
interactions between agents allow for co-operative behaviour between pairs of
agents. We contrast the properties of such a model with special cases of it, in
which interactions are restricted so that only competitive interactions between
pairs of agents are permitted. Such pure economic competition (PEC) behaviour
is regarded as desirable by economic theory, The properties of the two models
are strikingly different. A power law no longer provides a good description of
the relationship between the size and frequency of extinctions in the PEC
model, in which there are substantial numbers of very large extinctions. As a
result, the level of fitness of the system as a whole remains considerably
lower than in the general version of the model. This suggests that models of
pure economic competition do not provide a good description of how many
industries actually behave, and that a certain amount of collaboration and
co-operation between firms is required for the survival of an industry.

near operation, research and development has begun on increasing the

Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO), significant
improvements are being planned for installation in ~2007, increasing strain
sensitivity through improved suspensions and test mass substrates, active
seismic isolation, and higher input laser power. Even with the highest quality
optics available today, however, finite absorption of laser power within
transmissive optics, coupled with the tremendous amount of optical power
circulating in various parts of the interferometer, result in critical
wavefront deformations which would cripple the performance of the instrument.
Discussed is a method of active wavefront correction via direct thermal
actuation on optical elements of the interferometer. A simple nichrome heating
element suspended off the face of an affected optic will, through radiative
heating, remove the gross axisymmetric part of the original thermal distortion.
A scanning heating laser will then be used to remove any remaining
non-axisymmetric wavefront distortion, generated by inhomogeneities in the
substrate's absorption, thermal conductivity, etc. A proof-of-principle
experiment has been constructed at MIT, selected data of which are presented.

purpose algorithm to solve strongly coupled quantum field theories. The
renormalization group equation of F. Wegner and A. Houghton is shown to resum
the loop-expansion. Another version, due to J. Polchinski, is obtained by the
method of collective coordinates and can be used for the resummation of the
perturbation series. The genuinely non-perturbative evolution equation is
obtained in a manner reminiscent of the Schwinger-Dyson equations. Two variants
of this scheme are presented where the scale which determines the order of the
successive elimination of the modes is extracted from external and internal
spaces. The renormalization of composite operators is discussed briefly as an
alternative way to arrive at the renormalization group equation. The scaling
laws and fixed points are considered from local and global points of view.
Instability induced renormalization and new scaling laws are shown to occur in
the symmetry broken phase of the scalar theory. The flattening of the effective
potential of a compact variable is demonstrated in case of the sine-Gordon
model. Finally, a manifestly gauge invariant evolution equation is given for

in fibered manifolds. The emphasis is laid on the geometric aspects of the
theory. Especially functionals defined by real functions (Lagrange functions)
or differential forms (Lagrangian forms) on the first jet prolongation of a
given fibered manifold are studied. Critical points (critical cross sections)
of the functionals are examined and the Euler equations for them are derived in
a completely invariant manner. The first variation formula is derived by means
of the so-called Lepagian forms. All variations appearing in the theory are
generated by vector fields. Jet prolongations of projectable vector fields are
defined. The Euler form, associated with a given Lagrange function (of
Lagrangian form) is introduced by means of the Euler equations of the calculus
of variations. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the vanishing of the
Euler form are stated in terms of differential forms and their exterior
differential. The corresponding conditions for a Lagrange function leading to
identically vanishing Euler equations are given. Some special Lepagian forms
are studied. Classes of symmetries of a variational problem are defined.
Invariant, generalized invariant, and symmetry transformations are
characterized in terms of the Lie derivatives. The variational problem with
prescribed symmetry transformations is formulated, and necessary and sufficient
conditions for its solutions are studied. The geometrical aspects of the
so-called generally covariant variational theories are studied. Definitions and
theorems are well adapted to the situation in physical field theories.

Hamiltonian fashion, and T a subtorus of G. We prove that the kernel of
$\kappa:H_G^*(M)\to H^*(M//G)$ is generated by a small number of classes
$\alpha\in H_G^*(M)$ satisfying very explicit restriction properties. Our main
tool is the equivariant Kirwan map, a natural map from the G-equivariant
cohomology of M to the G/T-equivariant cohomology of the symplectic reduction
of M by T. We show this map is surjective. This is an equivariant version of
the well-known result that the (nonequivariant) Kirwan map $\kappa:H_G^*(M)\to
H^*(M//G)$ is surjective. We also compute the kernel of the equivariant Kirwan
map, generalizing the result due to Tolman and Weitsman in the case T=G and
allowing us to apply their methods inductively. This result is new even in the
case that dim T = 1. We close with a worked example: the cohomology ring of the
product of two $\C P^2$s, quotiented by the diagonal 2-torus action.

stretched vortices in an axisymmetric strain are constructed and studied. The
set of matrix equations is extended to include the effect of viscosity by
incorporating an evolution equation for the Cauchy invariants, which represents
a lagrangian analogue of the Helmholtz equation for a viscous fluid.

techniques for an introductory treatment of general relativity in which the
emphasis is on mathematical deduction from physical measurement procedure.
Using ideas of geometric optics, geodesic motion is understood from the
refraction of the wave function due curvature. The k-calculus gives a very
simple derivation of Schwarzschild, showing that the geometry is equivalent to
the existence of a fundamental minimum time, proportional to rest mass, between
the interactions of elementary particles. The Newtonian approximation is seen
from direct application of red shift to the wave function. Finally differential
geometry is introduced, showing that the k-calculus gives an equivalent
