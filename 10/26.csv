bursts (GRBs) in clusters are shown to have an apparent shift relative to the
position of the source. Hence the main conclusion follows: only cluster of GRBs
ensures correct localization of the source whereas determining the direction of
arrival of a single GRB practically carries no information about the position
of its source. Generation of repeated GRBs in the activity phase of the source,
which amounts to 3-4 months and with the period of repetition of activity equal
to 4 years are most general properties of clusters. These properties precisely
correspond to the characteristics of manifestation of activity of X-ray NOVAE
(BHXN), thus pointing that the source of GRB clusters considered is a black
hole (BH) in the XN. The direct identification of the GRB source with the BHXN
GRO J0422+32 presented here this confirms. The investigated properties of GRB
clusters permit a final solution of 2 main problems of astrophysics: search for
black holes and origin of cosmic GRBs.

viscosity due to nonleptonic weak interactions involving hyperons in
neutron-star cores, including new relativistic and superfluid effects. We
evaluate the influence of this new bulk viscosity on the gravitational
radiation driven instability in the r-modes. We find that the instability is
completely suppressed in stars with cores cooler than a few times 10^9 K, but
that stars rotating more rapidly than 10-30% of maximum are unstable for
temperatures around 10^10 K. Since neutron-star cores are expected to cool to a
few times 10^9 K within seconds (much shorter than the r-mode instability
growth time) due to direct Urca processes, we conclude that the gravitational
radiation instability will be suppressed in young neutron stars before it can
significantly change the angular momentum of the star.

age. We find a self-similar solution for the evolution of a SIDM halo in the
limit where the mean free path between collisions, $\lambda$, is everywhere
longer than the gravitational scale height, $H$. Typical halos formed in this
long mean free path regime relax to a quasistationary gravothermal density
profile characterized by a nearly homogeneous core and a power-law halo where
$\rho \propto r^{-2.19}$. We solve the more general time-dependent problem and
show that the contracting core evolves to sufficiently high density that
$\lambda$ inevitably becomes smaller than $H$ in the innermost region. The core
undergoes secular collapse to a singular state (the ``gravothermal

Hubble time for a typical dark matter-dominated galaxy core at the present

N-body simulations for SIDM, providing a simple physical interpretation of
their results and extending them to higher spatial resolution and longer

polarization characteristics, are consistent with the inner 10 Schwarzschild
radii of a tight Keplerian emitting region of hot, magnetized, orbiting gas.
This plasma may also be the source through self-Comptonization of the X-rays
detected by Chandra. It has long been suspected that the circularization region
between the quasi-spherical infall at large radii, and this inner zone, is
responsible for producing the rest of Sgr A*'s spectrum. In this paper, we
report the results of a detailed study of this region. First, the combination
of existing cm and X-ray data preclude the possibility of producing the
observed strong 1.36 GHz radio flux via thermal synchrotron within a bounded
flow. If Sgr A*'s radio spectrum is produced by accreting gas, it appears that
a non-thermal particle distribution is a necessity. Second, if this is the
correct picture for how Sgr A*'s spectrum is produced, it appears that the
Chandra-detected X-rays may originate either from self-Comptonization in the
inner Keplerian region, or from optically-thin nonthermal synchrotron emission
in the much larger, circularization zone, extending up to 500 Schwarzschild
radii or more. This is a question that should be answered by upcoming broadband
observations, since the mm-bump and X-rays are strongly correlated in the
former case, whereas the X-rays are strongly correlated to the cm-radio flux in
the latter. In addition, X-rays produced in the circularized gas could show
periodic or quasi-periodic variations, but not those produced via nonthermal
synchrotron emission much farther out.

provides very strong evidence for a compact emitting region near this
supermassive black hole at the Galactic center. Sgr A*'s mm/sub-mm spectrum and
polarimetric properties, and its quiescent-state X-ray flux density, are
consistent with a model in which low angular momentum gas captured at large
radii circularizes to form a hot, magnetized Keplerian flow within tens of
Schwarzschild radii of the black hole's event horizon. In Sgr A*'s quiescent
state, the X-ray emission appears to be produced by self-Comptonization (SSC)
of the mm/sub-mm synchrotron photons emitted in this region. In this paper, we
show that the prominent X-ray flare seen in Sgr A* may be due to a sudden
enhancement of accretion through the circularized flow. Depending on whether
the associated response of the anomalous viscosity is to increase or decrease
in tandem with this additional injection of mass, the X-ray photons during the
outburst may be produced either via thermal bremsstrahlung (if the viscosity
decreases), or via SSC (if the viscosity increases). However, the latter
predicts a softer X-ray spectrum than was seen by Chandra, so it appears that a
bremsstrahlung origin for the X-ray outburst is favored. A strong correlation
is expected between the mm/sub-mm and X-ray fluxes when the flare X-rays are
produced by SSC, while the correlated variability is strongest between the
sub-mm/far-IR and X-rays when bremsstrahlung emission is dominant during the
flare. In addition, we shows that future coordinated multi-wavelength
observations planned for the 2002 and 2003 cycles may be able to distinguish
between the accretion and jet scenarios.

earlier VLA radio and HST UV spectral measurements, provide the strictest
constraints on the nature of accretion onto the supermassive black hole (called
M31* hereafter) in this region. One of the two newly-detected sources within
roughly an arcsec of M31* may be its X-ray counterpart. If not, the X-ray flux
from the nucleus must be even lower than inferred previously. Some uncertainty
remains regarding the origin of the UV excess from the compact component known
as P2. In our earlier analysis, we developed a unified picture for the
broadband spectrum of this source. Contrary to the `standard' picture in which
the infalling plasma attains temperatures in excess of 10^{10} K near the event
horizon, the best fit model for M31*, under the assumption that the UV
radiation is in fact produced by this source, appears to correspond to a cool
branch solution, arising from strong line cooling inside the capture radius.
Starting its infall with a temperature of about 10^6 K in the post-shock
region, the plasma cools down efficiently to about 10^4 K toward smaller radii.
An important prediction of this model is the appearance of a prominent UV spike
from hydrogen line emission. In this paper we model this line emission with
significantly greater accuracy, using the algorithm CLOUDY, and to correctly
take into account the attenuation along the line of sight. We predict a
spectrum with several additional prominent emission lines that can be used to
verify the model with future high-resolution observations.

chromium to zinc equivalent widths indicates the host is depleted in dust
relative to local values to a similar degree as damped Lyman alpha systems at

statistically show a different spectral shape variability with flux change from
the BLS1s: the spectra of NLS1s become harder as total flux increases while
those of BLS1s soften. We attribute the different spectral variations to a
strong stable 'soft excess' in NLS1s, while it is weak in BLS1s. For two types
of objects, the power law component similarly becomes softer with increasing
intensity. These imply that the soft excess originates from the Big Blue Bump
and power law emission is from Compton upscattering of UV or Soft X-ray
photons. Our results are consistent with what is widely accepted that NLS1s

a new statistical procedure due to Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) for

testing. The importance of this method to source detection algorithms is
immediately clear. To explore the possibilities offered we have developed a new
task for performing source detection in radio-telescope images, Sfind 2.0,

measurement tasks, Imsad and SExtractor, and comment on several issues arising
from the nature of the correlation between nearby pixels and the necessary
assumption of the null hypothesis. The strong suggestion is made that
implementing FDR as a threshold defining method in other existing
source-detection tasks is easy and worthwhile. We show that the constraint on
the fraction of false detections as specified by FDR holds true even for highly
correlated and realistic images. For the detection of true sources, which are
complex combinations of source-pixels, this constraint appears to be somewhat
less strict. It is still reliable enough, however, for a priori estimates of

function. With decreasing temperature, the short-range correlation with
two-site periodicity develops first, and then another correlation with $n$-site
periodicity at lower temperature. This behavior is in contrast to that of the
inverse square interaction model, where the specific heat shows a single peak
according to the exact solution. Our algorithm has an advantage that neither
computational time nor memory depends on the multiplicity $n$ per site; the

growth equation, in 1+1 dimensions, supports this observation below a critical
parametric range, above which generic instabilities, in the form of isolated
pillared structures lead to deviations from standard scaling behavior.
Possibilities of controlling this instability by introducing statistically

nonlinearities have also been discussed.

categories has witnessed a booming interest in the last ten years, due to the
increased availability of documents in digital form and the ensuing need to
organize them. In the research community the dominant approach to this problem
is based on machine learning techniques: a general inductive process
automatically builds a classifier by learning, from a set of preclassified
documents, the characteristics of the categories. The advantages of this
approach over the knowledge engineering approach (consisting in the manual
definition of a classifier by domain experts) are a very good effectiveness,
considerable savings in terms of expert manpower, and straightforward
portability to different domains. This survey discusses the main approaches to
text categorization that fall within the machine learning paradigm. We will
discuss in detail issues pertaining to three different problems, namely
document representation, classifier construction, and classifier evaluation.

test particle in the stationary field of a central slowly rotating body is
generated, in the weak-field and slow-motion approximation of General

motion of the test particle. In it the gravitomagnetic field is due to the
central body's angular momentum supposed to be constant. In the context of the
gravitational analogue of the Larmor theorem, such acceleration looks like a
Coriolis inertial term in an accelerated frame. In this paper the effect of the
variation in time of the central body's angular momentum on the orbit of a test

acceleration due to the time derivative of the angular velocity vector of an

find new regions of the parameter space where significant negative

unification within SU(5) framework can occur with nonuniversal gaugino masses.
Specifically we find that for the case where the gaugino mass matrix transforms
like a 24 plet one finds a negative contribution to the b quark mass
irrespective of the sign of the Higgs mixing parameter $\mu$ when the
supersymmetric contribution to $g_{\mu}-2$ is positive. We exhibit regions of

$|\lambda_b-\lambda_{\tau}|/\lambda_{\tau}$ on the parameter space is also

transforms from rapidly decreasing closed differential forms on arithmetic
quotients of the symmetric spaces of orthogonal and unitary groups to spaces of
classical Siegel and Hermitian modular forms. These transforms came from the
theory of dual reductive pairs and the theta correspondence. They computed the
Fourier expansion of these transforms in terms of periods over certain totally
geodesic cycles . This also gave rise to the realization of intersection
numbers of these `special' cycles with cycles with compact support as Fourier
coefficients of modular forms. The purpose of this paper is to initiate a
systematic study of this transform for non rapidly decreasing differential
forms by considering the case for the finite volume quotients of hyperbolic
space coming from unit groups of isotropic quadratic forms over the rationals.
We expect that many of the techniques and features of this case will carry over
to the more general situation.

layer between fluids. These candidate RT models are based on point sources
within bubbles (or plumes) and interaction with each other (or the background

natural way to get an orthogonal basis without going outside the Schroedinger

is the basis of some recent attempts by many-worlds proponents to solve the
basis problem. But these eigenstates do not enjoy the locality and
quasi-classicality properties of the states defined by environmental
