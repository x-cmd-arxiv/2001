the early universe is examined. A new quantum-gravitational-dynamics model
suggests that the mechanism of the hot big bang is functionally equivalent to
the mechanism of turbulence, where an inertial-vortex force at Planck scales
matches the Planck gravitational force and drives the formation of
space-time-energy and the formation of more Planck particles, more spinning
Planck-Kerr particles, and a big bang turbulence cascade to larger scales
before cooling to the strong force freeze out temperature. Temperature
fluctuations between the Planck temperature and strong force temperature are
mixed by turbulence to give a Corrsin-Obukhov spectral form. Inflation
fossilizes the turbulent temperature fluctuations by stretching them beyond the
horizon scale of causal connection ct, where c is light speed and t is time.
Fossil temperature turbulence fluctuations seed anisotropies in the
nucleosynthesis of light elements, causing density fluctuations that seed the
first formation of gravitational structure in the matter dominated
hydrogen-helium plasma: proto-voids at galaxy supercluster scales. Evidence of
the proposed big bang turbulence event and first gravitational structure
formation is provided by the spectral form of the cosmic microwave temperature
fluctuations, which have been misinterpreted as sonic.

on-board the XMM-Newton Observatory. The resulting spectrum contains a wealth
of emission lines from various charge states of oxygen, neon, magnesium, and
iron. Examination of the cross-dispersion profiles of several of these lines
provides clear, unambiguous evidence of resonance scattering by the highest
oscillator strength lines, as well as a weak temperature gradient in the inner
regions of the interstellar medium. We invoke a sophisticated new Monte Carlo
technique which allows us to properly account for these effects in performing
quantitative fits to the spectrum. Our spectral fits are not subject to many of
the systematics that have plagued earlier investigations. The derived metal
abundances are higher than have been inferred from prior, lower spectral
resolution observations of this source (Awaki et al. 1994), but are still
incompatible with conventional chemical enrichment models of elliptical
galaxies. In addition, our data are incompatible with standard cooling flow
models for this system - our derived upper limit to the mass deposition rate is
below the predicted value by a factor of 3--5.

produced during big bang nucleosynthesis (such as D, He-4 or Li-7) condensed in

when the IGM was neutral since the collisional cross-section between neutral
species is smaller than the corresponding Coulomb cross-section in an ionized
gas. We find that diffusion led to small deviations in element abundances of up

environments could provide information about the thermal and ionization history

understanding of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. Kinetic helicity has long been
known to be important for large scale field growth in forced MHD turbulence,
and has been recently demonstrated numerically to be asymptotically consistent
with slow mean field dynamo action in a periodic box. Here we show numerically
that the magnetic spectrum at and below the forcing scale is also strongly
influenced by kinetic helicity. We identify a critical value, $f_{h,crit}$
above which the magnetic spectrum develops maxima at wavenumber $= 1$ scale
{\it and} at the forcing scale, For $f< f_{h,crit}$ the field peaks only at the
resistive scale. Kinetic helicity may thus be important not only for generating
a large scale field, but also for establishing observed peaks in magnetic
spectra at the forcing scale. The turbulent Galactic disk provides an example
where both large scale ($>$ supernova forcing scale) fields and small scale
($\le$ forcing scale, with peak at forcing scale) fields are observed. We
discuss this, and the potential application to the protogalaxy, but also
emphasize the limitations in applying our results to these systems.

a significant secular variation of the projected semi-major axis of the pulsar
at a rate of $\dot x\equiv d(a_{\rm 1} \sin i)/dt = (-0.23\pm 0.03)\times
10^{-12}$, which is probably caused by the Newtonian spin-orbit coupling in
this binary system leading to a precession of the orbital plane. The required
misalignment of the spin and orbital angular momenta of the companion are
evidence for an asymmetric supernova explosion. We have also confirmed that the
orbital period is currently decreasing at a rate of $\dot P_{\rm b}=(-15.5 \pm
0.8)\times 10^{-12}$s s$^{-1}$ and have measured second and third orbital
period derivatives $d^2P_{\rm b}/dt^2=(+2.1 \pm 0.3)\times 10^{-20} {\rm

in another eclipsing pulsar system, PSR B1957+20. The observed variation of the
orbital parameters constrains the maximal value of the companion radius to
$R_{\rm c max} \sim 0.06 R_{\odot}$ and implies that the companion is
underfilling its Roche lobe by 50 %. The derived variation in the quadrupole
moment of the companion is probably caused by tidal dissipation similar to the
mechanism proposed for PSR B1957+20. We conclude that the companion is at least
partially non-degenerate, convective and magnetically active.

the presently most accurate determination of the brown dwarf census in the

simulations in a pseudo-Newtonian potential. By varying the saturation level of
the magnetorotational instability that leads to angular momentum transport, we
show that the dynamics of gas inside the radius of marginal stability varies
depending upon the magnetic field strength just outside that radius. Weak
fields are unable to causally connect material within the plunging region to
the rest of the disk, and zero torque is an approximately correct boundary
condition at the radius of marginal stability. Stronger fields, which we obtain
artificially but which may occur physically within more complete disk models,
are able to couple at least some parts of the plunging region to the rest of
the disk. In this case, angular momentum (and implicitly energy) is extracted
from the material in the plunging region. Furthermore, the magnetic coupling to
the plunging region can be highly time dependent with large fluctuations in the
torque at the radius of marginal stability. This implies varying accretion
efficiencies, both across systems and within a given system at different times.
The results suggest a possible link between changes in X-ray and outflow
activity, with both being driven by transitions between weak and strong field

correlation length xi_{corr} of this short range order. It is shown that
superconducting energy gap averaged over these fluctuations is non zero in a
wide temperature range above T_c - the temperature of homogeneous

the gap over the random field of fluctuations. For temperatures T>T_c
superconductivity apparently appears in separate regions of space (``drops'').
These effects become weaker for shorter correlation lengths xi_{corr} and the

Lett A272, (2000)] and strings via WZWN models in the context of applications
to cuprates and related materials.The connection between quantum groups and
strings is one way of seeing the validity of our previous conjecture [i.e. that
a theory for cuprates may be constructed on the basis of quantum groups]. The
cuprates seems to exhibit statistics, dimensionality and phase transitions in
novel ways. The nature of excitations [i.e. quasiparticle or collective] must
be understood. The Hubbard model captures some of the behaviour of the phase
transitions in these materials. On the other hand the phases such as stripes in
these materials bear relationship to quantum group or string-like solutions.
One thus expects that the relevant solutions of Hubbard model may thus be
written in terms of stringy solutions. In short this approach may lead to the
non-perturbative formualtion of Hubbard and other condensed matter
Hamiltonians. The question arises that how a 1-d based symmetry such as quantum
groups can be relevant in describing a 3-d [spatial dimensions] system such as
cuprates. The answer lies in the key observation that strings which are 1-d
objects can be used to describe physics in $d$ dimensions. For example gravity
[which is a 3-d [spatial] plus time] phenomenon can be understood in terms of
1-d strings. Thus we expect that 1-d quantum group object induces physics in
2-d and 3-d which may be relevant to the cuprates. We present support for our
contention using [numerical] variational Monte-Carlo [MC] applied to 2d d-p
model. We also briefly discuss others ways to formulate a string picture for
cuprates, namely by exploiting connection between gauge theories and strings
and t'Hooft picture of quark confinement.

been a longstanding puzzle. Until recently it was believed to be an amorphous
state in which the crystal would break into crystallites. But a different
theory predicts the existence of a novel phase of matter: the so-called Bragg
glass, which is a glass and yet nearly as ordered as a perfect crystal. The
lattice of vortices that can contain magnetic flux in type II superconductors
provide a good system to investigate these ideas. Here we show that neutron
diffraction data of the vortex lattice in type II superconductors provides
unambiguous evidence for a weak, power-law decay of the crystalline order
characteristic of a Bragg glass. The theory also predicts accurately the
electrical transport properties of superconductors; it naturally explains the
observed phase transition and the dramatic jumps in the critical current
associated with the melting of the Bragg glass. Moreover the model explains
experiments as diverse as X-ray scattering in disordered liquid crystals and

  First of all, we discuss the descriptive incompleteness of the cea's. In this
direction, we show that some important notions, like independence of
conditional events, cannot be properly addressed in the framework of
conditional event algebras, while they can be precisely formulated and analyzed
in the temporal setting.
  We also demonstrate that the embeddings allow one to use Markov chain
algorithms (suitable for the temporal calculus) for computing probabilities of
complex conditional expressions of the embedded conditional event algebras, and
that these algorithms can outperform those previously known.

$\widetilde{\mu}_{g}$ on ${\Bbb C}$ such that under the Segal-Bargmann
transform $S_{\mu_g}$ the space $L^2({\Bbb R},\mu_g)$ is isomorphic to the

Segal-Bargmann transform $S_{\mu_p}$ for the Poisson measure $\mu_{p}$ and
prove the corresponding result. As a consequence, when $\mu_{g}$ and $\mu_{p}$
have the same variance, $L^2({\Bbb R},\mu_g)$ and $L^2({\Bbb R},\mu_p)$ are
isomorphic to the same space ${\cal H}L^2({\Bbb C}, \widetilde{\mu}_{g})$ under

homogeneous and (partially) of Adams on almost alternating knots.
  We give a counterexample to, and a corrected version of a theorem of Jones on
the Alexander polynomial of 4-braid knots. We also give an example of a knot on
which all previously applied braid index criteria fail to estimate sharply
(from below) the braid index. A relation between (generalizations of) such
examples and a conjecture of Jones that a minimal braid representation has
unique writhe is discussed.

  Certificates","LaTeX2e, 13 pages",,,,"quant-ph cs.CC",,"  The class MA consists of languages that can be efficiently verified by
classical probabilistic verifiers using a single classical certificate, and the
class QMA consists of languages that can be efficiently verified by quantum
verifiers using a single quantum certificate. Suppose that a verifier receives
not only one but multiple certificates. In the classical setting, it is obvious
that a classical verifier with multiple classical certificates is essentially
the same with the one with a single classical certificate. However, in the
quantum setting where a quantum verifier is given a set of quantum certificates
in tensor product form (i.e. each quantum certificate is not entangled with
others), the situation is different, because the quantum verifier might utilize
the structure of the tensor product form. This suggests a possibility of
another hierarchy of complexity classes, namely the QMA hierarchy. From this
point of view, we extend the definition of QMA to QMA(k) for the case quantum
verifiers use k quantum certificates, and analyze the properties of QMA(k).
  To compare the power of QMA(2) with that of QMA(1) = QMA, we show one
interesting property of ``quantum indistinguishability''. This gives a strong
evidence that QMA(2) is more powerful than QMA(1). Furthermore, we show that,
for any fixed positive integer $k \geq 2$, if a language L has a one-sided
bounded error QMA(k) protocol with a quantum verifier using k quantum
certificates, L necessarily has a one-sided bounded error QMA(2) protocol with
a quantum verifier using only two quantum certificates.
