  controversy","7 pages, 3 figures","Astrophys.J.580:627-633,2002","10.1086/343847",,"astro-ph",,"  Simulations predict that the dark matter halos of galaxies should have
central cusps, while those inferred from observed galaxies do not have cusps.
We demonstrate, using both linear perturbation theory and n-body simulations,
that a disk bar, which should be ubiquitous in forming galaxies, can produce
cores in cuspy CDM dark matter profiles within five bar orbital times.
Simulations of forming galaxies suggest that one of Milky Way size could have a
10 kpc primordial bar; this bar will remove the cusp out to approximately 5 kpc
in approximately 1.5 gigayears, while the disk only loses approximately 8% of
its original angular momentum. An inner Lindblad-like resonance couples the
rotating bar to orbits at all radii through the cusp, transferring the bar
pattern angular momentum to the dark matter cusp, rapidly flattening it. This
resonance disappears for profiles with cores and is responsible for a
qualitative difference in bar driven halo evolution with and without a cusp.
This bar induced evolution will have a profound effect on the structure and
evolution of almost all galaxies. Hence, both to understand galaxy formation
and evolution and to make predictions from theory it is necessary to resolve
these dynamical processes. Unfortunately, correctly resolving these important
dynamical processes in ab initio calculations of galaxy formation is a daunting
task, requiring at least 4,000,000 halo particles using our SCF code, and
probably requiring many times more particles when using noisier tree, direct
summation, or grid based techniques, the usual methods employed in such
calculations.

$\omega_m$, and that its inclusion in CMB parameter estimation also affects the
present constraints on other parameters such as the curvature or the scalar
spectral index of primordial fluctuations. This degeneracy has the effect of
limiting the precision of parameter estimation from the MAP satellite, but it
can be broken by measurements on smaller scales such as those provided by the

pointings in the direction of the Lockman Hole. The XMM observations were
performed with the European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) during the performance
verification phase. Total effective exposure time was ~ 100 ksec. The best fit
temperature based on a simultaneous fit of spectra from the all EPIC cameras is
4.9(+1.5/-0.9) keV. Metallicity is poorly constrained even using the joint fit
of all spectra, with an upper limit on the iron abundance of 0.62 solar. Using
the best fit model parameters, we derived a bolometric luminosity of L(bol) =
3.4x10^44 h_{50}^-2 erg /s. Despite the fact that it was observed at fairly
large off-axis angle, the temperature errors are much smaller compared with
those of typical measurements based on ASCA or Beppo-Sax observations of z >
0.6 clusters, demonstrating the power of the XMM for determining the X-ray
temperature for high-z clusters. The measured temperature and luminosity show
that one can easily reach the intrinsically X-ray faint and cool cluster regime
comparable with those of z ~ 0.4 clusters observed by past satellites. The new
cluster temperature and L(bol) we have measured for RXJ1053.7+5735 is
consistent with a weak/no evolution of the L(bol) - Tx relation out to z ~ 1.3,

low-extinction windows in the regions studied, as local minima in the A_K maps
reaching A_K values about 2 standard deviations below the mean values found in
the neighbouring areas. Schlegel et al.'s (1998) FIR extinction maps, which
integrate dust contributions throughout the Galaxy, are structurally similar to
those derived with 2MASS photometry in the two studied windows. We thus
conclude that the dust clouds affecting the 2MASS and FIR maps in these

bulge stars. However, the A_K absolute values differ significantly. In
particular, the FIR extinction values for W359.4-3.1 are a factor ~1.45 larger

M_1 as a function of the age of the system. The mass of the primary we find
ranges from M_1= 60+-19 msun for ZAMS models, which sets an upper limit for
M_1, down to M_1= 40+-9 msun for an age of 2 Myr. Accordingly, the upper limit

constraints on the physical properties of its source, SGR 1900+14. We make
detailed comparisons of the published data with the magnetar model. The giant
flare evolved through three stages, whose radiative mechanisms we address in
turn. A triggering mechanism is proposed, whereby a helical distortion of the
core magnetic field induces large-scale fracturing in the crust and a twisting
deformation of the crust and exterior magnetic field. The envelope of the
pulsating tail of the August 27 flare can be accurately fit, after ~40 s, by
the contracting surface of a relativistically hot, but inhomogeneous, trapped
fireball. We quantify the effects of direct neutrino-pair emission, thereby
deducing a lower bound ~ 10^{32} G-cm^3 to the magnetic moment of the confining
field. The radiative flux during the intermediate ~40 s of the burst appears to
exceed the trapped fireball fit. The spectrum and lightcurve of this smooth
tail are consistent with heating in an extended pair corona, possibly powered
by continuing seismic activity in the star. We consider in detail the critical
luminosity, below which a stable balance can be maintained between heating and
radiative cooling in a confined, magnetized pair plasma; but above which the
confined plasma runs away to local thermodynamic equilibrium. In the later
pulsating tail, the best fit temperature equilibrates at a value which agrees
well with the regulating effect of photon splitting. The remarkable four-peaked
substructure within each 5.16-s pulse provides strong evidence for the presence
of higher magnetic multipoles in SGR 1900+14. The corresponding collimation of
the X-ray flux is related to radiative transport in a super-QED magnetic field.

an estimator based on total luminosity density. The cosmic spectrum is fitted
with models of population synthesis, tracing the history of star formation
prior to the epoch of the observed galaxies, using a method we have developed
which decouples continuum and spectral-line variations and is robust against
spectrophotometric uncertainties. The cosmic spectrum can only be fitted with
models incorporating chemical evolution and indicates there was a peak of
star-formation rate in the past of at least three times the current value and
that the increase back to z=1, assuming it scales as (1+z)^beta, has a strong
upper limit of beta<5. We find in the general case there is some model
degeneracy between star formation at low and high redshift. However, if we
incorporate previous work on star formation at z<1 we can put strong upper
limits on the SFR at z>1: e.g., if beta>2 then the SFR for 1<z<5 scales as
(1+z)^alpha with alpha<2. This is equivalent to stating that no more than 80%
of stars in the Universe formed at z>1. Our results are consistent with the
best-fit results from compilations of cosmic SFR estimates based on UV
luminosity density, which give 1.8<beta<2.9 and -1.0<alpha<0.7, and are also

  SuperComputing using Particles, J. Makino & P.Hut, eds",,,,"astro-ph",,"  I report on recent progress in our understanding of the structure of CDM
halos, and in particular of the inner mass profile of galaxy-sized systems.
Numerical simulations have consistently shown that the density profiles of CDM
halos steepen monotonically from the center outwards, with slopes shallower
than isothermal near the center and steeper than isothermal near the virial
radius. Ongoing debate centers on the precise radial dependence of the
logarithmic slope, as well as on whether it approaches a well defined
asymptotic central value. The latest high-resolution simulations suggest that
the circular velocity profile is well approximated by the model proposed by
Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW). On the other hand, the radial dependence of the
slope of the density profile differs modestly, but significantly, from the
model proposed by NFW. As a result, NFW fits tend to underestimate the density
at radii just inside the scale radius. Rather than implying a very steep (-1.5)
inner divergent slope, I argue that the data is actually best represented by a
model where the density profile becomes increasingly shallow with radius, with
little sign of approach to a well-defined asymptotic value. A model where the
{\it phase-space density profile} is a power law accounts well for these
results and suggests that the innermost slope may be as shallow as -0.75. These
conclusions are supported by a thorough numerical convergence study that
elucidates the effect of numerical parameters such as the timestep,
gravitational softening, and particle number, on the mass profile of simulated
dark matter halos.

thin, dynamically fragile stellar disks. N-body simulations of a
disk/bulge/halo model of the Milky Way that includes several hundred dark

only a minor dynamical role in the heating of the disk. This is because the
orbits of satellites seldom take them near the disk, where their tidal effects
are greatest. We conclude that substructure might not preclude virialized CDM

that the gravitational collapse pulled the field lines into an hour-glass

and close to the center of the core, suggesting that the dust alignment
efficiency may decrease at high density. The plane-of-sky field strength can be
estimated with the modified Chandrasekhar-Fermi formula, and the small

is strong ($\gtrsim$ 2mG) and perhaps dominates the turbulent motions in the

identify faint stream-like structures within the halo of the Milky Way.
Selecting stars with colours consistent with M-giant stars, we find a strong
over-density of sources on a stream with pole (l=95,b=13), which corresponds to
the pole of the orbit of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. This great-circle
feature of width ~12 degrees, contains 5% of the late M-giants in the Halo. No
other stream-like structures are detected in M-giants in the 2MASS Second
Incremental Data Release (2IDR), and in particular, we find no evidence for a
stellar component to the Magellanic Stream. This suggests that the present
accretion rate of low-mass satellites with a luminous component is very low,
and the formation of the luminous component of the Halo must have been
essentially complete before the accretion of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, more
than 3Gyr ago. We also search for great-circle streams using almost all
high-latitude (|b|>30) sources in the 2IDR dataset. No narrow great-circle
streams of width 0.5-2 degrees were found, though we were only sensitive to
relatively nearby (<17kpc) remnants of massive (10^6 Msun) globular clusters.
If the Galactic potential is close to being spherical, as some recent
observations suggest, the lack of observed great-circle streams is consistent
with the presence of dark matter substructures in the Halo. Although
alternative explanations cannot be ruled out from our analysis of the 2IDR
dataset, future experiments with better statistics have the potential to reveal
the heating effect of dark matter substructure on stellar streams.

redshift completeness limit, close to 5000 km/s. If instead of SSRS2, we use

z$\sim$0.7. We model the luminosity function for nearby galaxy groups by a
Schechter function with parameters M*=(-19.99+/-0.36)+5logh and alpha=-1.46 +/-
0.17 to compute the mass to light ratio. The median value of the mass to light
ratio is 360 h M/L and we deduce a relation between mass to light ratio and
velocity dispersion sigma (M/L=3.79 +/- 0.64)sigma -(294 +/- 570)). The more
massive the group, the higher the mass to light ratio, and therefore, the
larger the amount of dark matter inside the group. Another explanation is a
significant stripping of the gas of the galaxies in massive groups as opposed
to low mass groups. This extends to groups of galaxies the mild tendency
already detected for rich clusters of galaxies. Finally, we detect a barely
significant fundamental plane for these groups but much less narrow than for

(..) The main results regarding integrated stellar populations are: * For young
bursts and the case of a constant SFR, nebular continuous emission - neglected

Therefore predicted emission line equivalent widths are considerably smaller
than found in earlier studies, whereas the detection of the continuum is eased.
Nebular line and continuous emission strongly affect the broad band photometric
properties of Pop III objects. * Due to stellar evolution, the hardness of the
ionising spectrum decreases rapidly, leading to the disappearance of the
characteristic HeII 1640 recombination lines after ~ 3 Myr in instantaneous
bursts. * The relative efficiency of ionising photon energy to heavy element
rest mass production, eta, of metal-poor and metal-free populations is

demonstrates that a disk bar can produce cores in a cuspy CDM dark-matter

rotating bar to halo orbits at all radii through the cusp, rapidly flattening
it. This resonance disappears for profiles with cores and is responsible for a
qualitative difference in bar-driven halo evolution with and without a cusp.
Although the bar gives up the angular momentum in its pattern to make the core,
the formation epoch is rich in accretion events to recreate or trigger a
classic stellar bar. The evolution of the cuspy inner halo by the
first-generation bar paves the way for a long-lived subsequent bar with low

along with a newly discovered nearby molecular cloud that we name RNO6NW. Both
clouds display striking similarities in their cometary structures and overall
kinematics. By using 13CO line observations, we estimate that these clouds have
similar sizes (~4.5 pc) and masses (~200 solar masses). Both molecular clouds
RNO6 and RNO6NW are active in star formation. From new high resolution near-IR
narrowband images, we confirm that RNO6 hosts an embedded IR cluster that
includes a Herbig Be star. A conspicuous H2 filament is found to delineate the
dense cometary head of the globule. RNO6NW hosts at least two IR sources and a
bipolar molecular outflow of ~0.9 pc of length and ~0.5 solar masses. We show
that the cometary structure of both clouds has been created by the UV radiation
from numerous OB stars lying ~1.5 degree to the north. Such OB stars are
associated with the double cluster h and chi Persei, and are probably members
of the PerOB1 association. Thus star formation inside these clouds has been
very likely triggered by the Radiation Driven Implosion (RDI) mechanism. From
comparison to RDI theoretical models, we find that the similar kinematics and
morphology of both clouds is well explained if they are at a re-expansion
phase. Triggered sequential star formation also explains the observed spatial
distribution of the members of the near-IR cluster inside the RNO6 cloud, and
the morphology of the H2 filament. We conclude that the RNO6 and RNO6NW clouds
are high-mass counterparts to the cometary globules of smaller masses which
have been studied up to now. Thus our observations demonstrate that the RDI
mechanism can produce, not only low mass stars in small globules, but also
intermediate mass stars and clusters in massive clouds.

found that these spirals in dense environments have on average: less molecular
gas per blue luminosity, higher atomic gas fraction, lower current star
formation rate, and the same star formation efficiency as field galaxies.
Although none of these results stand out as a single strong diagnostic, given
their statistical significance, taken together they indicate a trend for
diminished gas content and star formation activity in galaxies in high density
environments. Our results suggest that galaxies in dense environments have
either (i) consumed their molecular gas via star formation in the past or (ii)
that dense environments leads to an inhibition of molecular gas from atomic
phase. The similarities in star formation efficiency of the dense environments
and field galaxies suggest that the physical processes controling the formation
of stars from the molecular gas are local rather than global. We also found
that star formation rate per blue luminosity increases linearly as the total
amount of gas increases in LINERs. This result, based on a small sample,
suggests that LINERs are powered by star formation rather than an AGN.

and large deviations (as well as the connection between them) of the
distribution function of eigenstate amplitudes from the universal prediction of
random matrix theory. We find that small, weak localization-type, deviations
contain both diffusive contributions (determined by the bulk and boundary
conditions dependent terms) and ballistic ones which are generated by electron
dynamics below the length scale set by the mean free path ell. By relating the
extracted parameters of the functional form of nonperturbative deviations
(``far tails'') to the exactly calculated transport properties of mesoscopic
conductors, we compare our findings based on the full solution of the
Schrodinger equation to different approximative analytical treatments. We find
that statistics in the far tail can be explained by the exp-log-cube
asymptotics (convincingly refuting the log-normal alternative), but with
parameters whose dependence on ell is linear and, therefore, expected to be
dominated by ballistic effects. It is demonstrated that both small deviations
and far tails depend explicitly on the sample size--the remaining puzzle then
is the evolution of the far tail parameters with the size of the conductor
since short-scale physics is supposedly insensitive to the sample boundaries.

fine structure (XAFS) is treated within a Green's function formalism, without

representation of excitations and perturbation theory in the interaction
potential between electrons and quasi-bosons. These losses lead to an
asymmetric broadening of the main quasi-particle peak plus an energy-dependent
satellite in the spectral function. The x-ray absorption spectra (XAS) is then
given by a convolution of an effective spectral function over a one-electron
cross-section. It is shown that extrinsic and intrinsic losses tend to cancel
near excitation thresholds, and correspondingly, the strength in the main peak
increases. At high energies, the theory crosses-over to the sudden
approximation. These results thus explain the observed weakness of
multi-electron excitations in XAS. The approach is applied to estimate the
many-body corrections to XAFS, beyond the usual mean-free-path, using a phasor
summation over the spectral function. The asymmetry of the spectral function
gives rise to an additional many-body phase shift in the XAFS formula.

workshop reviewed existing and new PC-based accelerator control systems, from
small-scale to large-scale installations. It demonstrated convincingly the
advantage of modern, commercial mass-market products used for accelerator
controls. Disadvantages of these technologies were reported as well.
Large-scale PC systems inherently bring administrative concerns into the
picture. In this vein, special emphasis was given to system administration for
distributed systems. A major topic of the workshop was the integration of
different control system approaches as well as the integration of different
platforms within the same control system. In particular, PC-based concepts
offer the simple opportunity to interface to commercial SCADA systems. In
addition, large emphasis was given to the presentation of future developments
including the next network trends to data exchange via SOAP and XML.

performed by integrating over the fibers of this projection. The subtleties
associated with this procedure are identified. They require the inclusion of
some new finite-dimensional Jacobian superdeterminants, a deformation of the
worldsheet correlation functions using the stress tensor, and perhaps
paradoxically, another additional gauge choice, ``slice \hat\mu choice'', whose
independence also has to be established. This is done using an important
correspondence between superholomorphic notions with respect to a supergeometry
and holomorphic notions with respect to its super period matrix. Altogether,
the subtleties produce precisely the corrective terms which restore the
independence of the resulting gauge-fixed formula under infinitesimal changes
of gauge-slice. This independence is a key criterion for any gauge-fixed
formula and hence is verified in detail.

Randall-Sundrum braneworld cosmology. In this new scenario the existence of
extra-dimension(s) plays an essential role. First, the brane universe is
initially in the inflationary phase driven by the effective cosmological
constant induced by small mismatch between the vacuum energy in the
5-dimensional bulk and the brane tension. This mismatch arises since the bulk
is initially in a false vacuum. Then, the false vacuum decay occurs, nucleating
a true vacuum bubble with negative energy inside the bulk. The nucleated bubble
expands in the bulk and consequently hits the brane, bringing a hot big-bang
brane universe of the Randall-Sundrum type. Here, the termination of the
inflationary phase is due to the change of the bulk vacuum energy. The bubble
kinetic energy heats up the universe. As a simple realization, we propose a
model, in which we assume an interaction between the brane and the bubble. We
derive the constraints on the model parameters taking into account the
following requirements: solving the flatness problem, no force which prohibits
the bubble from colliding with the brane, sufficiently high reheating
temperature for the standard nucleosynthesis to work, and the recovery of
Newton's law up to 1mm. We find that a fine tuning is needed in order to
satisfy the first and the second requirements simultaneously, although, the
other constraints are satisfied in a wide range of the model parameters.

exploiting Morita equivalence. This duality maps the NC U(1) on the two-torus

of a 't Hooft flux, whose solution is completely known. Thus, assuming a smooth
dependence on $\theta$, we are able to construct a series rational approximants
of the original theory, which is finally reached by taking the large $N-$limit
at fixed 't Hooft flux. As we shall see, this procedure hides some subletities
since the approach of $N$ to infinity is linked to the shrinking of the
commutative two-torus to zero-size. The volume of NC torus instead diverges and
it provides a natural cut-off for some intermediate steps of our computation.
In this limit, we shall compute both the partition function and the correlator
of two Wilson lines. A remarkable fact is that the configurations, providing a
finite action in this limit, are in correspondence with the non-commutative
solitons (fluxons) found independently by Polychronakos and by Gross and

approximation then so does any diagram category with values in this category.
  From the homotopy theoretical point of view categories with model
approximations have similar properties to those of model categories. They admit
homotopy categories (localizations with respect to weak equivalences). They
also can be used to construct derived functors by taking the analogs of fibrant
and cofibrant replacements.
  A category with weak equivalences can have several useful model
approximations. We take advantage of this possibility and in each situation
choose one that suits our needs. In this way we prove all the fundamental
properties of the homotopy colimit and limit: Fubini Theorem (the homotopy
colimit -respectively limit- commutes with itself), Thomason's theorem about
diagrams indexed by Grothendieck constructions, and cofinality statements.

in a similar fashion so as to generate a quadruple field. The resultant
superimposed field is an offset quadruple field which allows us to center the
field on the high-energy beam in the interaction region of the PEPII B factory.
The dipole blocks are glued to the inside surface of an outer support collar
and the quadruple blocks are held in a fixture that allows radial adjustment of
the blocks prior to potting the entire assembly with epoxy. An extensive
computer model of the magnet has been made and from this model we developed a
tuning algorithm that allowed us to greatly reduce the n=3-17 harmonics of the
