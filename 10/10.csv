the formation of heavily dust-enshrouded stellar populations at high redshift,

between the local galaxy density distributions showed that in most cases there
is no statistically significant difference among galaxies of different activity
types. The comparison of the percentage of galaxies with nearby companions
showed that there is a higher percentage of LINERs, transition, and absorption
line galaxies with companions than Seyferts and HII galaxies. However, we find
that when we consider only galaxies of similar morphological types (ellipticals
or spirals), there is no difference in the percentage of galaxies with
companions among different activity types, indicating that the former result
was due to the morphology-density effect. Also, only small differences are
found when we consider galaxies with similar Halpha luminosities. The
comparison between HII galaxies of different Halpha luminosities shows that
there is a significantly higher percentage of galaxies with companions among
the higher luminosity HII galaxies, indicating that interactions increase the
amount of circumnuclear star formation, in agreement with previous results. The
fact that we find that galaxies of different activity types have the same
percentage of companions, suggests that interactions between galaxies is not a
necessary condition to trigger the nuclear activity in AGNs. We compare our

based on the assumption that the evolution of the two-point correlation is a
succession of stages of evolution, each of which spans a short enough period to
be considered approximately self-similar. In addition we assume that clustering
is stable on scales where a physically motivated `virialization condition' is
satisfied. These assumptions lead to a definite prediction for the behavior of
the two-point correlation function in the strongly nonlinear regime. We show
that the prediction agrees well with N-body simulations in non-Einstein-de

argue that subpulses are emitted within narrow flux tubes of the dipolar field
lines and that the mean pulsar beam has a conal structure. In such a model the
longitudes of profile components are determined by the intersection of the line
of sight trajectory with subpulse-associated emission beams. Thus, we show that
the difference in the frequency dependence of subpulse and profile component
longitudes is a natural property of the conal model of pulsar emission beam. We
support our conclusions by numerical modelling of pulsar emission, using the
known parameters for this pulsar, which produce results that agree very well
with our dual frequency observations.

globular clusters as a diagnostic of partial mixing processes between the base
of the convective envelope and the H-burning shell. The Bump located along the
differential luminosity function of cluster RGB stars is a key observable to
constrain the H-profile inside these structures. In fact, standard evolutionary
models that account for complete mixing in the convective unstable layers and
radiative equilibrium in the innermost regions do predict that the first
dredge-up lefts over a very sharp H-discontinuity at the bottom of the
convective region. Interestingly enough we found that both atomic diffusion and
a moderate convective overshooting at the base of the convective region
marginally affects the shape of the RGB Bump in the differential Luminosity
Function (LF). As a consequence, we performed several numerical experiments to
estimate whether plausible assumptions concerning the smoothing of the
H-discontinuity, due to the possible occurrence of extra-mixing below the
convective boundary, affects the shape of the RGB Bump. We found that the
difference between the shape of RGB Bump predicted by standard and by smoothed
models can be detected if the H-discontinuity is smoothed over an envelope
region whose thickness is equal or larger than 0.5 pressure scale heights.
Finally, we briefly discuss the comparison between theoretical predictions and
empirical data in metal-rich, reddening free Galactic Globular Clusters (GGCs)
to constrain the sharpness of the H-profile inside RGB stars.

(at 1$\sigma$ confidence level) of luminosity evolution, which is also needed
to correctly reproduce the total number and shape of the counts distribution at
1.4 GHz. Analysis of the de-evolved local radio luminosity function shows a
good agreement between data and model predictions for this class of sources.
Particular care has been devoted to the issue of 'lined' galaxies (i.e. objects
presenting in their spectra a continuum typical of early-type galaxies plus
emission lines of different nature), which appear as an intermediate class of
sources between AGN-dominated and starburst galaxies. Different evolutionary
behaviours are seen between the two sub-populations of lined and non-lined
low-power radio galaxies, the first class indicating a tendency for the radio
luminosity to decrease with look-back time, the second one showing positive
evolution. We note that different evolutionary properties also seem to
characterize BL Lacs selected in different bands, so that one might envisage an
association between lined FR I and the sub-class of BL Lacs selected in the

handled by the interplay between Jahn-Teller effect (supporting an axial

repulsion. The presented theory, while being a mean-field type, describes well

accelerated dipole oscillator, the criterion is that the center of mass motion
become relativistic within one oscillation period. The augmented formula and
the measurements which it summarizes presuppose an expanding inertial
observation frame. A static inertial reference frame will not do. Secondly, it
is found that the radiation measured in the expanding inertial frame is
received with 100% fidelity. There is no blueshift or redshift due to the

positivity and conservation. This is mathematically formalized by,
respectively, an energy condition, as the dominant energy condition, and the
vanishing of their divergence \nabla^\mu T_{\mu\nu}=0. The classical Bel and
Bel-Robinson superenergy tensors, generated from the Riemann and Weyl tensors,
respectively, are rank-4 tensors. But they share these two properties with
energy momentum tensors: the Dominant Property (DP) and the divergence-free
property in the absence of sources (vacuum). Senovilla defined a universal
algebraic construction which generates a basic superenergy tensor T{A} from any
arbitrary tensor A. In this construction the seed tensor A is structured as an
r-fold multivector, which can always be done. The most important feature of the
basic superenergy tensors is that they satisfy automatically the DP,
independently of the generating tensor A. In a previous paper we presented a
more compact definition of T{A} using the r-fold Clifford algebra. This form
for the superenergy tensors allowed to obtain an easy proof of the DP valid for
any dimension. In this paper we include this proof. We explain which new
elements appear when we consider the tensor T{A} generated by a
non-degree-defined r-fold multivector A and how orthogonal Lorentz
transformations and bilinear observables of spinor fields are included as
particular cases of superenergy tensors. We find some sufficient conditions for
the seed tensor A, which guarantee that the generated tensor T{A} is
divergence-free. These sufficient conditions are satisfied by some physical
fields, which are presented as examples.

still belong to the continuum class of spontaneous symmetry breaking. But for

These models are compactified, chiral, and don't require fine-tuning to
generate the top mass. Limits on the compactification scale based on
flavor-changing neutral currents are relaxed compared to those on existing
models. We then supersymmetrize some of these models. Using N=1 superspace

be used to localize fields. Finally, we discuss methods of breaking
supersymmetry and the impact of these models on the superpartner spectrum.

overpopulation of pions. The $hydrodynamics$ (with or without hadronic

  Apart of Equation of State (EoS), it has basically no free parameters. The
EoS which describe these data best agrees quite well with the lattice
predictions, with the QGP latent heat $\Delta\epsilon\approx 800 Mev/fm^3$.
Other phenomena at RHIC, such as ``jet quenching'' and huge ellipticity at
large $p_t$, also point toward very rapid entropy production. Its mechanism
remains an outstanding open problem: at the end we discuss recent application
of the instanton/sphaleron mechanism. The gg collisions with $\sqrt{s}=2-3 GeV$

implemented is investigated. The basic requirement is that it should be
consistent with the confinement of gauge interaction, the existence of quantum
states and the embedding in a bulk with arbitrary dimensions, signature and
topology.
  It is found that the embedding equations are compatible with a wide class of
Lagrangians, starting with a modified Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian as the
simplest one, provided minimal boundaries are added to the bulk.
  A non-trivial canonical structure is derived, suggesting a canonical
quantization of the brane-world geometry relative to the extra dimensions,
where the quantum states are set in correspondence with high frequency
gravitational waves. It is shown that in the cases of at least six dimensions,
there exists a confined gauge field included in the embedding structure. The
size of extra dimensions compatible with the embedding is calculated and found
to be different from the one derived with product topology.

important for data compression and have generated interests among computational
neuroscientists as well as applied mathematicians. Here we consider these bases
for a particularly simple stochastic process called ``generalized spike
process'', which puts a single spike--whose amplitude is sampled from the
standard normal distribution--at a random location in the zero vector of length
$\ndim$ for each realization.
  Unlike the ``simple spike process'' which we dealt with in our previous paper
and whose amplitude is constant, we need to consider the kurtosis-maximizing
basis (KMB) instead of the LSDB due to the difficulty of evaluating
differential entropy and mutual information of the generalized spike process.
By computing the marginal densities and moments, we prove that: 1) the BSB and
the KMB selects the standard basis if we restrict our basis search within all
possible orthonormal bases in ${\mathbb R}^n$; 2) if we extend our basis search
to all possible volume-preserving invertible linear transformations, then the
BSB exists and is again the standard basis whereas the KMB does not exist.
Thus, the KMB is rather sensitive to the orthonormality of the transformations
under consideration whereas the BSB is insensitive to that. Our results once
again support the preference of the BSB over the LSDB/KMB for data compression
applications as our previous work did.

Although theory allows for their propagation at any speed $v$, $0\le v\le c$,

It is of scientific and technological interest to trap gap solitons. We first
introduce an explicit multiparameter family of periodic structures with
localized defects, which support linear defect modes. These linear defect modes
are shown to persist into the nonlinear regime, as {\it nonlinear defect
modes}. Using mathematical analysis and numerical simulations we then
investigate the capture of an incident gap soliton by these defects. The
mechanism of capture of a gap soliton is resonant transfer of its energy to
nonlinear defect modes. We introduce a useful bifurcation diagram from which
information on the parameter regimes of gap soliton capture, reflection and

quartic in the momenta are investigated using the Jacobi geometrization of the
dynamics. This approach allows for a unified treatment of invariants at both
arbitrary and fixed energy. In the differential geometric picture, the quartic
invariant corresponds to the existence of a fourth rank Killing tensor.
Expressing the Jacobi metric in terms of a Kahler potential, the integrability
condition for the existence of the Killing tensor at fixed energy is a
non-linear equation involving the Kahler potential. At arbitrary energy,
further conditions must be imposed which lead to an overdetermined system with
isolated solutions. We obtain several new integrable and superintegrable
systems in addition to all previously known examples.

entropy and phase distribution. It is shown that the interference between
component states leads to non-classical oscillations in the photon number
distribution. At mid revival time the field is almost in the pure state.
  We have briefly discussed the evolution of the Q function of the cavity
field. The connection between the field entropy and the collapses and revivals

probability distribution of the field reflect the collapses and revivals of the
level occupation probabilities in most situations. The interaction brings about
the symmetrical splitting of the phase probability distribution. The general
