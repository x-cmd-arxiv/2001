been measured toward a dozen objects, mostly in the Vela and Chamaeleon
molecular clouds. The spectra show strong absorption of H2O and CO ice, as well
as weak features at `3.47' and 4.62 mu. No significant solid CH3OH feature at
3.54 mu is found, indicating that the CH3OH/H2O ice abundance is lower than
toward some massive protostars. Various evolutionary diagnostics are
investigated for a set of sources in Vela.

  2001",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The importance of stellar encounters in producing stellar exotica in dense
stellar clusters is reviewed. We discuss how collisions between main-sequence
stars may be responsible for the production of blue stragglers in globular
clusters. We also discuss the possible pathways to the production of X-ray
binaries, cataclysmic variables, and millisecond pulsars in globular clusters.
Neutron stars in globular clusters are likely to exchange into binaries
containing moderate-mass main-sequence stars, replacing the lower-mass
components of the original systems. These binaries will become
intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXBs), once the moderate-mass star evolves
off the main-sequence, as mass is transferred onto the neutron star possibly
spinning it up in the process. Such systems may be responsible for the
population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) that has been observed in globular
clusters. Additionally, the period of mass-transfer (and thus X-ray visibility)
in the vast majority of such systems will have occurred 5 - 10 Gyr ago thus
explaining the observed relative paucity of X-ray binaries today, given the
large MSP population.

the ESO Imaging Survey project (EIS) to further investigate the nature of the
EIS galaxy cluster candidates. These were originally identified by applying a
matched-filter algorithm which used positional and photometric data of the
galaxy sample extracted from the I-band survey images. In this paper, we apply
the same technique to the galaxy sample extracted from V-band data and compare
the new cluster detections with the original ones. We find that ~75% of the
low-redshift cluster candidates (z<0.6) are detected in both passbands and
their estimated redshifts show good agreement with the scatter in the redshift
differences being consistent with the estimated errors of the method. For the
``robust'' I-band detections the matching frequency approaches ~85%. We also
use the available (V-I) color to search for the red sequence of early-type
galaxies observed in rich clusters over a broad range of redshifts. This is
done by searching for a simultaneous overdensity in the three-dimensional
color-projected distance space. We find significant overdensities for ~75% of
the ``robust'' candidates with z_I<0.6. We find good agreement between the
characteristic color associated to the detected ""red sequence"" and that
predicted by passive evolution galaxy models for ellipticals at the redshift
estimated by the matched-filter. The results presented in this paper show the
usefulness of color data, even of two-band data, to both tentatively confirm
cluster candidates and to select possible cluster members for spectroscopic
observations. Based on the present results, we estimate that ~150 EIS clusters
with z_I<0.6 are real, making it one of the largest samples of galaxy clusters
in this redshift range currently available in the southern hemisphere.

modeled by a polytropic temperature profile, the reason being that the radius
at which the profiles break is much larger than the core radius characterizing
the gas density profiles. For r > 0.2 r_180, where the gas can be treated as a

shows that standard averaging techniques erase by their very construction the
possible existence of log-periodic corrections to scaling associated with a
discrete hierarchy. To remedy this drawback, we introduce a novel ``canonical''
averaging that we test extensively on synthetic examples constructed to mimick
the interplay between a weak log-periodic component and rather strong
multiplicative and phase noises. Our extensive tests confirm the remarkable
observation of statistically significant log-periodic corrections to scaling,
with a prefered scaling ratio for length scales compatible with the value gamma
= 2. A strong confirmation of this result is provided by the identification of
up to 5 harmonics of the fundamental log-periodic undulations, associated with
up to 5 levels of the underlying hierarchical dynamical structure. A natural
interpretation of our results is that the Richardson-Kolmogorov mental picture
of a cascade becomes a realistic description if one allows for intermittent
births and deaths of discrete cascades at varying scales.

  Testing","6 pages, submitted to ISIT2002",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The direct part of Stein's lemma in quantum hypothesis testing is revisited
based on a key operator inequality between a density operator and its pinching.
The operator inequality is used to show a simple proof of the direct part of
Stein's lemma without using Hiai-Petz's theorem, along with an operator
monotone function, and in addition it is also used to show a new proof of
Hiai-Petz's theorem.
