shock propagating in front of a bullet-like gas cloud just exiting the
disrupted cluster core. This is the first clear example of a shock front in a
cluster. From the jumps in the gas density and temperature at the shock, the
Mach number of the bullet-like cloud is 2-3. This corresponds to a velocity of
3000-4000 km/s relative to the main cluster, which means that the cloud
traversed the core just 0.1-0.2 Gyr ago. The 6-7 keV ""bullet"" appears to be a
remnant of a dense cooling flow region once located at the center of a merging
subcluster whose outer gas has been stripped by ram pressure. The bullet's
shape indicates that it is near the final stage of being destroyed by ram
pressure and gas dynamic instabilities, as the subcluster galaxies move well
ahead of the cool gas. The unique simplicity of the shock front and bullet
geometry in 1E0657-56 may allow a number of interesting future measurements.
The cluster's average temperature is 14-15 keV but shows large spatial
variations. The hottest gas (T>20 keV) lies in the region of the radio halo
enhancement and extensive merging activity involving subclusters other than the
bullet.

taken using the ESO Wide Field Imager we have identified so far 74 candidate RR

light variations and pulsation periods have been obtained for 54 of them, 47 of
which are Bailey {\it ab}-type RR Lyrae's (RRab's) and 7 are {\it c}-type
(RRc's). The period distribution of the presently confirmed sample of RRab's
peaks at P=0\fd60, with a minimum period of 0\fd54. The pulsational properties
indicate for Leo I an intermediate Oosterhoff type, similar to other dwarf
galaxies in the Local Group and the LMC. However, the rather long minimum
period of the {\it ab}-type variables, and the significant number of RRab's
with long period and large amplitude, suggest that the bulk of the old
population in Leo I is more like the Oosterhoff type II globular clusters. The
most straightforward interpretation is that a range in metallicity is present
among the RR Lyrae's of Leo I, with a significant population of very metal-poor
stars. Alternatively, these OoII variables could be more evolved. The average
apparent magnitude of the RR Lyrae's across the full cycle is $<V(RR)>= 22.60

largest and best studied major mergings known. Given the fact that these poor

to study the physics of the intracluster medium and to look for the possible
presence of shocks.
  We derived the gas distribution profiles, the global (i.e. within 0.3 Mpc)
temperatures and abundances and the temperature profiles and maps for
SC1327-312 and SC1329-313. Also the presence of soft excess in LECS and hard

both, pure hydrodynamic jets and jets with a dynamically significant magnetic
field. The setups were chosen to match the setups of two other publications,
and recomputed with the MHD code NIRVANA. We show that NIRVANA and the two
other codes give comparable, but not identical results. We find that some
global properties of a hydrodynamical jet simulation, like e.g. the bow shock
velocity, converge at 100 points per beam radius (ppb) with NIRVANA. The
situation is quite different after switching on the toroidal magnetic field: In
this case, global properties converge even at 10 ppb. In both cases, details of
the inner jet structure and especially the terminal shock region are still
insufficiently resolved, even at our highest resolution of 70 ppb in the
magnetized case and 400 ppb for the pure hydrodynamic jet. In the case of our
highest resolution simulation, we can report two new features: First, small
scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities are excited at the contact discontinuity
next to the jet head. This slows down the development of the long wavelength
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and its turbulent cascade to smaller wavelengths.
Second, the jet head develops Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities which manage to
entrain an increasing amount of mass from the ambient medium with resolution.
This region extends in our highest resolution simulation over 2 jet radii in
the axial direction.

Lomb peak height, its width and its relations to other peaks in the complete

joint-distribution of the frequency position (relative to other peaks) and of
the height of the highest peak of the power spectrum. We also provide the

coupling and the Zeeman coupling with the magnetic field give rise to two spin
subbands, in terms of which most of the transport properties can be discussed.
  The strongest conductivity anisotropy occurs for Zeeman energies of the order
of the Fermi energy corresponding to the depopulation of the upper spin
subband. The energy scale associated with the spin-orbit coupling controls the
strength of the effect. More in particular, we find that the detailed behavior
and the sign of the anisotropy depends on the underlying scattering mechanism.

in the spheroidal geometry are discussed and the corresponding Frohlich-like
electron-phonon interaction is reported in the framework of the dielectric
continuum approach. It is shown that the interface phonon modes are strongly
dependent on the nanocrystal geometry, particularly on the ellipsoid's
semi-axis ratio. The new Raman selection rules have revealed that solely
interface phonon modes with even angular momentum are allowed to contribute to
the first order phonon-assisted scattering of light. On this basis we are able
to give an explanation for the observed low frequency shoulders present in the

approximation and the pseudopotential approach are used to study and
characterize the ferroelastic phase transition in calcium chloride (CaCl_2). In
accord with experiment, the energy map of CaCl_2 has the typical features of a
pseudoproper ferroelastic with an optical instability as ultimate origin of the
phase transition. This unstable optic mode is close to a pure rigid unit mode
of the framework of chlorine atoms and has a negative Gruneisen parameter. The
ab-initio ground state agrees fairly well with the experimental low temperature
structure extrapolated at 0K. The calculated energy map around the ground state
is interpreted as an extrapolated Landau free-energy and is successfully used
to explain some of the observed thermal properties. Higher-order anharmonic
couplings between the strain and the unstable optic mode, proposed in previous
literature as important terms to explain the soft-phonon temperature behavior,
are shown to be irrelevant for this purpose. The LAPW method is shown to
reproduce the plane-wave results in CaCl_2 within the precision of the
calculations, and is used to analyze the relative stability of different phases
in CaCl_2 and the chemically similar compound SrCl_2.

the strain dependence of the soliton self-energy and specific features of the

class of C-IC transitions where the IC modulation is one-dimensional, the
anisotropy in the order parameter space is small, and the symmetry of the
systems allows the existence of the Lifshitz invariant. Two other mechanisms of
soliton attraction are operative here but the universal mechanism considered in
this paper is found to be the most important one in some cases. Comparison with
the most extensively studied C-IC transition in $\rm K_2SeO_4$ shows that the

of a collapsing fluid star. Specifically, we consider the initial value problem
for a massless scalar field in a spacetime similar to the Oppenheimer-Snyder
collapse model, and numerically evolve in time the relevant wave equation. Our
main objective is to examine whether the phenomenon of parametric
amplification, known to be responsible for the strong amplification of
primordial perturbations in the expanding Universe, can efficiently operate
during gravitational collapse. Although the time-varying gravitational field
inside the star can, in principle, support such a process, we nevertheless find
that the perturbing field escapes from the star too early for amplification to
become significant. To put an upper limit in the efficiency of the
amplification mechanism (for a scalar field) we furthermore consider the case
of perturbations trapped inside the star for the entire duration of the
collapse. In this extreme case, the field energy is typically amplified at the
level ~ 1% when the star is about to cross its Schwarszchild radius.
Significant amplification is observed at later stages when the star has even
smaller radius. Therefore, the conclusion emerging from our simple model is
that parametric amplification is unlikely to be of significance during
gravitational collapse. Further work, based on more realistic collapse models,
is required in order to fully assess the astrophysical importance of parametric
amplification.

  Fuji-Yoshida, Japan, August 2001",,,"KUNS-1740","hep-ph",,"  In this talk, we propose a GUT scenario in which doublet-triplet splitting is
naturally realized in SO(10) unification using the Dimopoulos-Wilczek mechanism
and the realistic mass matrices of quarks and leptons are obtained in a simple
way. For the neutrino sector, bi-maximal neutrino mixing angles are realized.
Moreover, the generic interaction is allowed, namely, all the terms which are
allowed by the symmetry are included in the scenario. Therefore, once we fix
the integer number charges of the anomalous U(1)_A symmetry, which plays an
essential role in the scenario, all the scales, GUT breaking scale, mass scales
of superheavy particles, are determined. The scenario can be extended into E_6
unification, in which a condition for suppression of flavor changing neutral
current (FCNC) is automatically satisfied.

prescription which maps to the boundary all the information contained in the
bulk. In particular, we show that the divergent local terms of the on-shell
action contain information about the Legendre transformed generating
functional, and that the new constraints for which the irregular modes
propagate in the bulk are the same constraints for which such divergent local
terms cancel out. In this situation, the addition of counterterms is not
required. We also show that there exist particular cases for which the
unitarity bound is reached, and the conformal dimension becomes independent of
the effective mass. This phenomenon has no bulk counterpart.

can have a stage of a fast-roll inflation. In this regime the standard
slow-roll condition |m^2| << H^2 is violated. Nevertheless, this stage can be
rather long if |m| is sufficiently small. Fast-roll inflation can be useful for
generating proper initial conditions for the subsequent stage of slow-roll
inflation in the very early universe. It may also be responsible for the
present stage of accelerated expansion of the universe. We also make two
observations of a more general nature. First of all, the universe after a long
stage of inflation (either slow-roll or fast-roll) cannot reach anti-de Sitter
regime even if the cosmological constant is negative. Secondly, the theories
with the potentials with a ""stable"" minimum at V(\phi)<0 in the cosmological
background exhibit the same instability as the theories with potentials
unbounded from below. This instability leads to the development of singularity
with the properties practically independent of V(\phi). However, the
development of the instability in some cases may be so slow that the theories
with the potentials unbounded from below can describe the present stage of
cosmic acceleration even if this acceleration occurs due to the fast-roll
inflation.

arithmetic quotient $X = \Gamma D$. In this paper, we give an explicit formula
for the integral $\kappa(\Psi(F))$ of $-\log||\Psi(F)||^2$ over $X$, where
$||.||^2$ is the Petersson norm. More precisely, this integral is given by a
sum over $\mu$ and $m>0$ of quantities $c_\mu(-m) \kappa_\mu(m)$, where
$\kappa_\mu(m)$ is the limit as $Im(\tau) -> \infty$ of the $m$th Fourier
coefficient of the second term in the Laurent expansion at $s= n/2$ of a
certain Eisenstein series $E(\tau,s)$ of weight $n/2 + 1$ attached to $V$. It
is also shown, via the Siegel--Weil formula, that the value $E(\tau, n/2)$ of
the Eisenstein series at this point is the generating function of the volumes
of the divisors $Z_\mu(m)$ with respect to a suitable K\""ahler form. The
possible role played by the quantity $\kappa(\Psi(F))$ in the Arakelov theory
of the divisors $Z_\mu(m)$ on $X$ is explained in the last section.

arising in the Eckhaus unstable regime. Modulated amplitude waves (MAWs) are
quasi-periodic solutions of the CGLE that emerge near the Eckhaus instability
of plane waves and cease to exist due to saddle-node bifurcations (SN). These
MAWs can be characterized by their average phase gradient $\nu$ and by the
spatial period P of the periodic amplitude modulation. A numerical bifurcation
analysis reveals the existence and stability properties of MAWs with arbitrary
$\nu$ and P. MAWs are found to be stable for large enough $\nu$ and
intermediate values of P. For different parameter values they are unstable to
splitting and attractive interaction between subsequent extrema of the
amplitude. Defects form from perturbed plane waves for parameter values above
the SN of the corresponding MAWs. The break-down of phase chaos with average
phase gradient $\nu$ > 0 (``wound-up phase chaos'') is thus related to these
SNs. A lower bound for the break-down of wound-up phase chaos is given by the
necessary presence of SNs and an upper bound by the absence of the splitting
instability of MAWs.

semi-exclusive nucleon electro-production from nuclear targets. We demonstrate
how the increase of transferred energies in these reactions opens a complete
new window in studying the microscopic nuclear structure at small distances.
The simplifications in theoretical descriptions associated with the increase of
the energies are discussed. The theoretical framework for calculation of high
energy nuclear reactions based on the effective Feynman diagram rules is
described in details. The result of this approach is the generalized eikonal
approximation (GEA), which is reduced to Glauber approximation when nucleon
recoil is neglected. The method of GEA is demonstrated in the calculation of
high energy electro-disintegration of the deuteron and A=3 targets.
Subsequently we generalize the obtained formulae for A>3 nuclei. The relation
of GEA to the Glauber theory is analyzed. Then based on the GEA framework we
discuss some of the phenomena which can be studied in exclusive reactions,
these are: nuclear transparency and short-range correlations in nuclei. We
illustrate how light-cone dynamics of high-energy scattering emerge naturally
in high energy electro-nuclear reactions.

electromagnetic fluctuations inside the media. Although this approach is an
approximate one, it has wider areas of application than the Lifshitz theory of
the Casimir force. The general formulas of the impedance approach to the theory
