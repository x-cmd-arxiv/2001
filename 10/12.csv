axisymmetry, and neglect vertical stratification. The growth rates of the
instability on initially uniform magnetic fields are consistent with the linear
analysis of Blaes & Socrates 2001. As is the case when radiation effects are
neglected, the non-linear development of the instability leads to transitory
turbulence when the initial magnetic field has no net vertical flux. During the
turbulent phase, angular momentum is transported outwards. The Maxwell stress
is a few times the Reynolds stress, and their sum is about four times the mean
pressure in the vertical component of the magnetic field. For magnetic pressure
exceeding gas pressure, turbulent fluctuations in the field produce density
contrasts about equal to the ratio of magnetic to gas pressure. These are many
times larger than in the corresponding gas pressure dominated situation, and
may have profound implications for the steady-state vertical structure of
radiation-dominated disks. Diffusion of radiation from compressed regions damps
turbulent motions, converting kinetic energy into photon energy.

feedback is the expansion of H II regions within the cloud volume. This
conclusion is suggested by the low efficiency of star formation and
corroborated by dynamical models of H II regions. We evaluate the turbulent
energy input rate in clouds more massive than one third of a million solar
masses, for which gravity does not significantly affect the expansion of H II
regions. Such clouds achieve a balance between the decay of turbulent energy
and its regeneration in H II regions; summed over clouds, the implied ionizing
luminosity and star formation rate are roughly consistent with the Galactic
total. H II regions also photoevaporate their clouds: we derive cloud
destruction times somewhat shorter than those estimated by Williams and McKee.
The upper mass limit for molecular clouds in the Milky Way may derive from the
fact that larger clouds would destroy themselves in less than one crossing
time. The conditions within starburst galaxies do not permit giant molecular
clouds to be supported or destroyed by H II regions. This should lead to rapid
cloud collapse and the efficient formation of massive star clusters, explaining
some aspects of the starburst phenomenon.

alpha line emission is an efficient tool for identifying young galaxies at high
redshift, because it is strong in systems with young stars and little or no
dust-- properties expected in galaxies undergoing their first burst of
star-formation. Lyman alpha galaxies also provide a robust test of the
reionization epoch that is independent of Gunn-Peterson trough observations in
quasar spectra and is better able to distinguish line center optical depths
tau=5 from tau=10^5. This is because neutral gas scatters Lyman alpha photons,
dramatically ``blurring'' images of Lyman alpha galaxies embedded in a neutral
intergalactic medium and rendering them undetectable.

shallow solution is perturbed upstream from this critical point, mass
overloading results, and the critical point is shifted inwards. This wind
exhibits a broad, stationary region of decelerating flow and its velocity law
has kinks. Third, for perturbations even further upstream, the overloaded wind
becomes time-dependent, and develops shocks and dense shells.

metal-semiconductor interfaces by contacting CoSi2-islands grown on Si(111)
with an STM-tip. The conductance per unit area was found to increase with
decreasing diode area. Indeed, the zero-bias conductance was found to be about
10^4 times larger than expected from downscaling a conventional diode. These
observations are explained by a model, which predicts a narrower barrier for
small diodes and therefore a greatly increased contribution of tunneling to the
electrical transport.

different observables are found to lead to the same value of Teff, suggesting
several experimental procedures to measure Teff. New, simple experimental
protocols to access Teff from a generalized equipartition theorem are also
proposed, and one such experiment is numerically performed. These results give
strong support to the thermodynamic interpretation of Teff and make it

transition of the protein molecule is triggered through its sensitivity to a
subphase bulk field (pH in this study), changing in the course of the
photochemical process. Thus, reaction of photoaquation of the ferrocyanide ion,
which increases the subphase pH from 7.0 to about 8.3, produces a change in the
surface monolayer pressure, $\Delta\Pi$, between -0.5 and +1.5 ${\rm mN/m}$

rubber is thought of as a composite where regions with low concentrations of
junctions between chains are randomly distributed in the bulk material. The
onset of these inclusions is associated with the inhomogeneity in spatial
distribution of a cross-linker during the mixing process. With reference to the
theory of transient networks, the time-dependent response of an elastomer is
modelled as thermally activated processes of breakage and reformation of chains
in domains with low concentrations of junctions, whereas junctions in the bulk
medium are treated as permanent. Stress-strain relations are developed by using
the laws of thermodynamics. Adjustable parameters in the constitutive equations
are found by fitting experimental data in tensile relaxation tests for several
grades of unfilled and carbon black filled natural rubber. It is demonstrated
that (i) the average relaxation time noticeably grows with the elongation
ratio, which is explained by mechanically-induced crystallization of strands,
and (ii) the relaxation spectrum of a filled elastomer is not affected by
mechanical pre-loading and thermal recovery at elevated temperatures.

algorithm is practical, scales to richer languages, and yields a new notion of
canonical form sufficient for adequate encodings of logical systems. The

finite lattice volume, especially in the lighter quark mass region. We employ a

magnets, bus and power supplies in the MI enclosure and service buildings. In
each service building, a PLC control system controls pumps and valves, and it
monitors pressures, flow, resistivities and temperatures. The PLC hardware
system consists of a Gateway module and a variety of I/O modules, which are
made by Sixnet of Clifton Park, NY. The control system communicates with other
buildings including MCR (Main Control Room) via an Ethernet link and front-end
computers. For more details of the MI LCW control system, refer to [1] and [2].
One of the key elements of the PLC software is called ISaGRAF workbench, which
was created by CJ International of Seyssins, France. The workbench provides a
comprehensive control-programming environment, where control programs can be
written in five different languages. For more details of ISaGRAF, refer to [3].

Kaluza-Klein Melvin model which has single parameter $b$. The corresponding
U-dual background is a R-R type IIA solution describing an orthogonal
intersection of $N$ flux 7-branes. Like the Melvin model, the NS-NS string
model with $N$ continuous parameters is explicitly solvable; we present its
perturbative spectrum and torus partition function explicitly for the N=2 case.
For generic $b_s$ (above some critical values) there are tachyons in the $S^1$
winding sector. A remarkable feature of this model is that while in the Melvin
N=1 case all supersymmetry is broken, a fraction of it may be preserved for $N
>1$ by making a special choice of the parameters $b_s$. Such solvable NS-NS
models may be viewed as continuous-parameter analogs of non-compact orbifold
models. They and their U-dual R-R fluxbrane counterparts may have some
``phenomenological'' applications. In particular, in N=3 case one finds a
special 1/4 supersymmetric R-R 3-brane background. Putting Dp-branes in flat
twisted NS-NS backgrounds leads to world-volume gauge theories with reduced
amount of supersymmetry. We also discuss possible ways of evolution of unstable
backgrounds towards stable ones.

charges of asymptotically de Sitter (dS) spacetimes from data at early or late

tensor of the dual. We compute the masses of Schwarzschild-de Sitter black
holes in four and five dimensions, and the masses and angular momenta of
Kerr-de Sitter spaces in three dimensions. All these spaces are less massive
than de Sitter, a fact which we use to qualitatively and quantitatively relate
de Sitter entropy to the degeneracy of possible dual field theories. Our
results in general dimension lead to a conjecture: Any asymptotically de Sitter
spacetime with mass greater than de Sitter has a cosmological singularity.
Finally, if a dual to de Sitter exists, the trace of our stress tensor computes
the RG equation of the dual field theory. Cosmological time evolution
corresponds to RG evolution in the dual. The RG evolution of the c function is
then related to changes in accessible degrees of freedom in an expanding
universe.

expressions for the energies of these states and E2 transition strengths
between them. Characteristics of both pure and mixed-symmetry PDS eigenstates
are discussed and the resulting spectra and transition strengths are compared
to those of real nuclei. The PDS concept is shown to be relevant to the
description of prolate, oblate, as well as triaxially deformed nuclei.
Similarities and differences between the fermion case and the previously
established partial SU(3) symmetry in the Interacting Boson Model are
considered.

of an effective field theory for large scattering lengths. As in the triton
case, consistent renormalization requires a one-parameter three-body force at
leading order whose renormalization group evolution is governed by a limit
cycle. Constraining unknown parameters from symmetry considerations and the
measured binding energy of the hypertriton, we calculate the low-energy phase
shifts for doublet Lambda d scattering. For the low-energy parameters, we find
a_{Lambda d}=(16.8^{+4.4}_{-2.4}) fm and r_{Lambda d}=(2.3 +/- 0.3) fm, where
the errors are due to the uncertainty in the hypertriton binding energy. Since
the hypertriton is extremely shallow, low-energy three-body observables in this
channel are very insensitive to the exact values of the Lambda N low-energy
parameters.

means of quantum Monte Carlo simulations is tested and compared with previously
proposed methods using simple model systems. This method can be applied within
all the quantum Monte Carlo techniques, just requiring to accumulate the
positron-electron distribution function. The annihilation rate of e$^+$LiH as a
function of the internuclear distance is studied using a model potential
approach to eliminate the core electrons of Li, and explicitly correlated wave
functions to deal with all the remaining particles. These results allow us to
compute vibrationally averaged annihilation rates, and to understand the effect
of the Li$^+$ electric field on positron and electron distributions.
