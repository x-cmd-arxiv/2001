Here, we report the discovery of the afterglow of this unique burst. In order

invoke a model involving an hard electron distribution, p ~ 1.5 and a jet-break

towards a mechanism for a deep space propulsion system. We concentrate at
first, as an example, on Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) antihydrogen. In a
Bose-Einstein Condensate, matter (or antimatter) is in a coherent state
analogous to photons in a laser beam, and individual atoms lose their
independent identity. This allows many atoms to be stored in a small volume. In
the context of recent advances in producing and controlling BECs, as well as in
making antihydrogen, this could potentially provide a revolutionary path
towards the efficient storage of large quantities of antimatter, perhaps
eventually as a cluster or solid.

using tools developed within the context of quantum information theory. We
consider a model in which the system is a qubit, and reaches equilibrium after
several successive two-qubit interactions (thermalizing machines) with qubits
of a reservoir. We characterize completely the family of thermalizing machines.
The model shows a tight link between dissipation, fluctuations, and the maximal
entanglement that can be generated by the machines. The interplay of quantum
and classical information processes that give rise to practical irreversibility
is discussed.
