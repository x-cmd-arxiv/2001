construct spatial images of the source differential flux which are used to
create lists of incoming X-ray photons, preserving information on photon

complete the simulation. Data analysis is currently in progress and simulated

determines the ratio beta of specific thermal energies in dark matter and

\propto sigma8^{5/3}, and measure a 4% error on sigma8 arising from cosmic

the LCDM model matches EMSS and RDCS X-ray-selected survey observations under
economical assumptions for intracluster gas evolution. Using transformations of
mass-limited cluster samples that mimic sigma8 variation, we explore SZ search
expectations for a 10 sq deg survey complete above 10^{14} Msun/h. Cluster
counts are shown to be extremely sensitive to sigma8 uncertainty while redshift
statistics, such as the sample median, are much more stable. For LCDM, the
characteristic temperature at fixed sky surface density is a weak function of
redshift, implying an abundance of hot clusters at z>1. Assuming constant beta,
four kT>8 keV clusters lie at z>2 and 40 kT>5 keV clusters lie at z>3 on the

systems. In disk-dominated cataclysmic variables, these outflows are
responsible for most of the features in UV and FUV spectra. However, there have
been very few attempts to model the features that appear in the spectra of
disk-accreting cataclysmic variables quantitatively. The modelling that has
been attempted has been concentrated almost entirely on explaining the shape of
C IV.
  Here we describe a new hybrid Monte Carlo/Sobolev code that allows a
synthesis of the complete UV spectrum of a disk-dominated cataclysmic variable.
A large range of azimuthally-symmetric wind geometries can be modelled. Changes
in line shape in eclipsing systems can also be studied. Features in the
synthesized spectra include not only well-known resonance lines of O VI, NV, Si
IV, and C IV, but, with an appropriate choice of mass loss rate and wind
geometry, many of the lines originating from excited lower states that are
observed in HUT, FUSE, and ORFEUS spectra. The line profiles of C IV resemble
those calculated by previous workers, when an identical geometry is assumed. We
compare the synthesized spectra to HUT spectrum of Z Cam, showing that in this
case a reasonably good ``fit'' to the spectrum can be obtained.

than the Cycle 5 observations, which provides unambiguous separation of the
faint blue helium burning stars (BHeB stars) from contaminant populations. The
depth of the photometry allows us to compare recent star formation histories
recovered from both the main sequence (MS) stars and the BHeB stars for the
last 300 Myr. The excellent agreement between these independent star formation
rate (SFR) calculations is a resounding confirmation for the legitimacy of
using the BHeB stars to calculate the recent SFR. Using the BHeB stars we have
calculated the global star formation history over the past 700 Myr. The history
calculated from the Cycle 7 data is remarkably identical to that calculated
from the Cycle 5 data, implying that both halves of the galaxy formed stars in

the first time, at a scale of ~50km. We report the detection of a large, ~250km
diameter surface feature for which we propose the name ``Piazzi''; however it
is presently uncertain if this feature is due to a crater, albedo variegation,

semi-minor axes of R_1=484.8+/-5.1km and R_2=466.4+/-5.9km, respectively, for
the illumination-corrected projected ellipsoid. Although albedo features are
seen, they do not allow for a definitive determination of the rotation or pole
positions of Ceres, particularly because of the sparse sampling (two epochs) of
the 9 hour rotation period. From full-disk integrated albedo measurements, we
find that Ceres has a red spectral slope from the mid- to near-UV, and a
significant blue slope shortward of the mid-UV. In spite of the presence of
Piazzi, we detect no significant global differences in the integrated albedo as
a function of rotational phase for the two epochs of data we obtained. From
Minnaert surface fits to the near- and mid-UV images, we find an unusually
large Minnaert parameter of k~0.9, suggesting a more Lambertian than lunar-like
surface.

using Monte Carlo simulations of clusters embedded in a 25 deg^2 region of
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging data: the Matched Filter (MF; Postman
et al. 1996), the Adaptive Matched Filter (AMF; Kepner et al. 1999) and a
color-magnitude filtered Voronoi Tessellation Technique (VTT). Among the two
matched filters, we find that the MF is more efficient in detecting faint
clusters, whereas the AMF evaluates the redshifts and richnesses more
accurately, therefore suggesting a hybrid method (HMF) that combines the two.
The HMF outperforms the VTT when using a background that is uniform, but it is
more sensitive to the presence of a non-uniform galaxy background than is the
VTT; this is due to the assumption of a uniform background in the HMF model. We
thus find that for the detection thresholds we determine to be appropriate for
the SDSS data, the performance of both algorithms are similar; we present the
selection function for each method evaluated with these thresholds as a
function of redshift and richness. For simulated clusters generated with a
Schechter luminosity function (M_r^* = -21.5 and alpha = -1.1) both algorithms
are complete for Abell richness >= 1 clusters up to z ~ 0.4 for a sample
magnitude limited to r = 21. While the cluster parameter evaluation shows a
mild correlation with the local background density, the detection efficiency is
not significantly affected by the background fluctuations, unlike previous
shallower surveys.

FUSE spectra of 67% of observed Magellanic Cloud sources (52% of LMC and 92% of
SMC) exhibit absorption lines from the H2 Lyman and Werner bands between 912
and 1120 A. Our survey is sensitive to N(H2) >= 10^14 cm^-2; the highest column
densities are log N(H2) = 19.9 in the LMC and 20.6 in the SMC. We find reduced
H2 abundances in the Magellanic Clouds relative to the Milky Way, with average
molecular fractions <f_H2> = 0.010 (+0.005, -0.002) for the SMC and <f_H2> =
0.012 (+0.006, -0.003) for the LMC, compared with <f_H2> = 0.095 for the
Galactic disk over a similar range of reddening. The dominant uncertainty in
this measurement results from the systematic differences between 21 cm radio
emission and Lya in pencil-beam sight lines as measures of N(HI). These results
imply that the diffuse H2 masses of the LMC and SMC are 8 x 10^6 Msun and 2 x
10^6 Msun, respectively, 2% and 0.5% of the H I masses derived from 21 cm
emission measurements. The LMC and SMC abundance patterns can be reproduced in
ensembles of model clouds with a reduced H2 formation rate coefficient, R ~ 3 x
10^-18 cm^3 s^-1, and incident radiation fields ranging from 10 - 100 times the
Galactic mean value. We find that these high-radiation, low-formation-rate
models can also explain the enhanced N(4)/N(2) and N(5)/N(3) rotational
excitation ratios in the Clouds. We use H2 column densities in low rotational
states (J = 0 and 1) to derive a mean kinetic and/or rotational temperature
<T_01> = 82 +/- 21 K for clouds with N(H2) >= 10^16 cm^-2, similar to Galactic

  Conference Series",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We have been proposing two evolutionary paths to Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia),
which are called the supersoft X-ray source (SSS) channel and the symbiotic
channel, depending on the orbital separation just prior to an SN Ia explosion.
The essential difference of our treatment is inclusion of strong, optically
thick winds on mass-accreting white dwarfs (WDs) in binary evolutions when the
mass accretion rate on to WDs exceeds a critical rate of ~ 1 x 10^{-6} Mo/yr.
Once optically thick winds blow from the WD, the binary can avoid forming a
common envelope in some cases. So that the WDs are able to grow up to the
Chandrasekhar mass and explode as an SN Ia, showing SSS or recurrent nova
phenomena in the way to SNe Ia. Thus, the accretion wind process of WDs can
open new channels to SNe Ia. We have modeled the LMC supersoft source RX
J0513.9-6951 as an example of the systems in the accretion wind phase. Further
inclusions of two other elementary processes make the channels much wider;
these are the case BB mass transfer in the SSS channel and the strong orbital
shrinkage during the superwind phase of the primary star in the symbiotic
channel. As a result, the estimated birth rate of SNe Ia via these two channels
becomes compatible with the observation in our Galaxy. Interestingly, the U Sco
and T CrB subclasses of recurrent novae can be naturally understood as a part
of evolutionary stages in these two SSS and symbiotic channels to SNe Ia,
respectively. Thus we have a unified picture of binary evolutions to SNe Ia,
luminous SSS, and recurrent novae.

10-m Keck-II telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. This took the form of a continuous
read-out mode, enabling us to obtain a target spectrum between 3500 and 8500
\AA, with a dispersion of ~2.5 \AA/pix, every *70 milliseconds*. I present
results from 5 nights of observations of Interacting Binaries, using this novel
data acquisition system in July 1998. During the run we obtained more than 1.2
million optical spectra, many of which were simultaneous with pointed RXTE
observations. This fast spectroscopic capability has allowed us to explore
regimes previously only accessible with broadband instruments. I will
concentrate on results from the coordinated Keck/RXTE observations, which have
revealed interesting correlated variability on timescales from seconds to days.
I will also show the results of a spectroscopic-timing analysis of QPOs in

calibrate both infrared K and IRAS luminosities at the same time as kinematic
parameters of Long Period Variable stars (LPVs). Individual estimated absolute
magnitudes and a probabilistic assignation to galactic populations were deduced
from these calibrations for each LPV of our sample. Here we propose a scenario
of simultaneous stellar and circumstellar evolution according to the galactic
populations. The transitory states of S and Tc stars allow us to confirm the
location of the first dredge-up at $M_{bol}=-3.5$. There is also evidence
suggesting that a previous enrichment in s-elements from a more evolved
companion may accelerate the evolution along the AGB. The possible evolution to
OH LPVs is included in this scenario, and any of these stars may have a mass at
the limit of the capability for a C enrichment up to C/O > 1.
  A list of bright massive LPVs with peculiar envelope and luminosity
properties is proposed as Hot Bottom Burning candidates. The He-shell flash
star, R Cen, is found to be exceptionally bright and could become, before
leaving the AGB, a C-rich LPV brighter than the usual luminosity limit of
carbon stars.

  X-ray studies of proteins","14 pages, latex, 1 figure","Protein Sci. 10 (2001) 2480",,,"cond-mat hep-ph q-bio",,"  Photoionisation of an atom by X-rays usually removes an inner-shell electron
from the atom, leaving behind a perturbed ""hollow ion"" whose relaxation may
take different routes. In light elements, emission of an Auger electron is
common. However, the energy and the total number of electrons released from the
atom may be modulated by shake-up and shake-off effects. When the inner-shell
electron leaves, the outer-shell electrons may find themselves in a state that
is not an eigen-state of the atom in its surroundings. The resulting collective
excitation is called shake-up. If this process also involves the release of low
energy electrons from the outer shell, then the process is called shake-off. It
is not clear how significant shake-up and shake-off contributions are to the
overall ionisation of biological materials like proteins. In particular, the
interaction between the out-going electron and the remaining system depends on
the chemical environment of the atom, which can be studied by quantum chemical
methods. Here we present calculations on model compounds to represent the most
common chemical environments in proteins. The results show that the shake-up
and shake-off processes affect about 20% of all emissions from nitrogen, 30%
from carbon, 40% from oxygen, and 23% from sulphur. Triple and higher
ionisations are rare for carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, but are frequent for
sulphur. The findings are relevant to the design of biological experiments at
emerging X-ray free-electron lasers.

to apply to a non-infinite series of corrupted and correlated data, that is
typical of most observed natural time series. Specifically, a simple filter
that removes the corruption that creates rare unphysical causal states is
demonstrated, and the new concept of effective soficity is introduced. We
believe that Computational Mechanics cannot be applied to a noisy and finite
data series without invoking an argument based upon effective soficity. A
related distinction between noise and randomness is also defined: Noise can
only be eliminated by increasing the length of the time series, whereas the
resolution of random structure only requires the finite memory of the analysis
to be increased. The benefits of these new concepts are demonstrated on
simulated times series by (a) the effective elimination of white noise
corruption from a periodic signal using the expletive filter and (b) the
appearance of an effectively sofic region in the statistical complexity of a
biased Poisson switch time series that is insensitive to changes in the
wordlength (memory) used in the analysis. The new algorithm is then applied to
analysis of a real geomagnetic time series measured at Halley, Antarctica. Two
principal components in the structure are detected that are interpreted as the
diurnal variation due to the rotation of the earth-based station under an
electrical current pattern that is fixed with respect to the sun-earth axis and
the random occurrence of a signature likely to be that of the magnetic
substorm. In conclusion, a hypothesis is advanced about model construction in

the advantage of significantly higher processing speed, but at the cost of
slightly lower accuracy. Applications such as Information Retrieval, where the
speed can be more important than accuracy, could benefit from this approach.
  In the process of tagging, we first assign every word a unique ambiguity
class c_i that can be looked up in a lexicon encoded by a sequential FST. Every
c_i is denoted by a single symbol, e.g. [ADJ_NOUN], although it represents a
set of alternative tags that a given word can occur with. The sequence of the
c_i of all words of one sentence is the input to our FST cascade. It is mapped
by T1, from left to right, to a sequence of reduced ambiguity classes r_i.
Every r_i is denoted by a single symbol, although it represents a set of
alternative tags. Intuitively, T1 eliminates the less likely tags from c_i,
thus creating r_i. Finally, T2 maps the sequence of r_i, from right to left, to
a sequence of single POS tags t_i. Intuitively, T2 selects the most likely t_i
from every r_i.
  The probabilities of all t_i, r_i, and c_i are used only at compile time, not
at run time. They do not (directly) occur in the FSTs, but are ""implicitly

addition to three active neutrinos on the brane, all coupled strongly to one

of the annulus. In this skein, they are known to obey the same multiplication
rule as the symmetric Schur functions s_{\lambda}. But previous proofs of this
fact used results about quantum groups which were far beyond the scope of skein
theory. Our elementary proof uses only skein theory and basic algebra.

concerning 1-linear syzygies of curves embedded by complete linear systems of
sufficiently large degrees. Given a smooth, irreducible, complex, projective
curve $X$, we prove that the least integer $q$ for which the property $(M_q)$
fails for a line bundle $L$ on $X$ does not depend on $L$ as soon as its degree
becomes sufficiently large. Consequently, this number is an invariant of the
curve, and the statement of Green-Lazarsfeld's conjecture is equivalent to
saying that this invariant equals the gonality of the curve. We verify the
conjecture for plane curves, curves lying on Hirzebruch surfaces, and for
generic curves having the genus sufficiently large compared to the gonality. We
conclude the paper by proving that Green's canonical conjecture holds for
curves lying on Hirzebruch surfaces.

diffusion in low-dimensional chaotic dynamical systems. As an example, we
consider a periodic array of scatterers defined by a simple chaotic map on the
line. Adding different types of time-dependent noise to this model we compute
the diffusion coefficient from simulations. We find that there is a crossover
from deterministic to stochastic diffusion under variation of the perturbation
strength related to different asymptotic laws for the diffusion coefficient.
Typical signatures of this scenario are suppression and enhancement of normal
diffusion. Our results are explained by a simple theoretical approximation.

configuration of [12C_g.s.(0+) x p_Lambda], to the ground state were measured.
The splitting of the states was found to be DeltaE(1/2- - 3/2-) =
+152+-54(stat)+-36(syst) keV. This value is 20-30 times smaller than that of
single particle states in nuclei around this mass region. The
j_Lambda=l_Lambda-1/2 ((p_1/2)_Lambda) state appeared higher in energy, as in
normal nuclei. The value gives new insight into the YN interaction. The
excitation energies of the 1/2- and 3/2- states were obtained as
10.982+-0.031(stat)+-0.056(syst) MeV and 10.830+-0.031(stat)+-0.056(syst) MeV,

[12C(2+) x s_Lambda] configuration, to the ground state in 13LambdaC. The
excitation energy of the 3/2+ state was obtained as
4.880+-0.010(stat)+-0.017(syst) MeV. Nuclear gamma rays with energies of 4.438

the ideas behind this work concerns the analysis of the effects that the
gravity--induced quantum noise, stemming from the bodies in the neighborhood of
the Paul trap, could have upon the enhancement of the quantum behavior of this
system. This will be done considering a series expansion for the gravitational
field of the source, and including in the Hamiltonian of the Paul trap only the
first two terms. Higher--order contributions will be introduced as part of the
environment of the system, and in consequence will not appear in the
Hamiltonian. In other words, we put forward an argument that allows us to
differentiate those gravitational degrees of freedom that will appear as an
uncontrollable influence on the Paul trap. Along the ideas of the so called
restricted path integral formalism, we take into account the continuous
monitoring of the position of our particle, and in consequence the
corresponding propagators and probabilities, associated with the different
measurements outputs, are obtained.
  Afterwards, the differential equation related to a quantum nondemolition
variable is posed and solved, i.e., a family of quantum nondemolition
parameters is obtained. Finally, a qualitative analysis of the effects on the
system, of the gravity--induced environment, will be done.

self-induced excitation of a molecule moving above the dielectric or conducting

modulates the molecular transition frequency which results in a parametric

fluctuations. The present mechanism of instability of electrically neutral
molecules is different from that of the well-known Smith-Purcell and transition
radiation in which a moving charge and its oscillating image create an
oscillating dipole.

detectable coherent radiation flux of up to a microwatt.
