luminosity identified in local AGN (z < 0.1) is confirmed out to z=2. There is
tentative evidence for an increase in QSO X-ray variability amplitude towards
high redshifts (z > 2) in the sense that QSOs of the same X-ray luminosity are
more variable at z > 2. We discuss possible explanations for this effect. The

[O I]6300/[O III]5007 and [O II]3727/[O III]5007 than the BLRGs without the

attributed to the difference in the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the
ionizing radiation between the BLRGs with and without the double-peaked Balmer
emission, we perform photoionization model calculations using two types of
input continuum radiation; one has the strong big blue bump which is expected
for standard optically-thick accretion disks and another does not exhibit a
strong big blue bump as expected for optically-thin ADAFs. We find that the
data of the BLRGs with the double-peaked Balmer lines are consistent with the
models adopting the SED without a strong big blue bump while the data of the
BLRGs without the double-peaked emission lines are well described by the models
adopting the SED with a strong big blue bump. On the other hand, the observed
differences in the NLR emission is hard to be explain by the difference in the
contribution of shocks. These results support the idea that the double-peaked
Balmer lines arise at an outer region of an accretion disk which is illuminated

range of [Fe II] luminosities are observed within our sample (from less than 6
to 695 L_sun). Our data suggest that the bright [Fe II] SNRs are entering the
radiative phase and that the density of the local ISM largely controls the
amount of [Fe II] emission. We derive the following relation between the [Fe

of the postshock gas, n_e: L_[Fe II] (L_sun) ~ 1.1 n_e (cm^-3). We also find a
correlation in our data between L_[Fe II] and the metallicity of the
shock-heated gas, but the physical interpretation of this result remains
inconclusive, as our data also show a correlation between the metallicity and
n_e. The dramatically higher level of [Fe II] emission from SNRs in the central
regions of starburst galaxies is most likely due to their dense environments,
although metallicity effects might also be important. The typical [Fe
II]-emitting lifetime of a SNR in the central regions of starburst galaxies is

previously anticipated from sparse observations and simple theory, this is the

the effect have improved tremendously; high signal-to-noise images of the
effect (at low microwave frequencies) can now be obtained by ground-based
interferometric arrays. In the near future, high frequency measurements of the
effect will be made with bolomateric arrays during long duration balloon
flights. Towards the end of the decade the PLANCK satellite will extensive S-Z
surveys over a wide frequency range. Along with the improved observational
capabilities, the theoretical description of the effect and its more precise
use as a probe have been considerably advanced. I review the current status of

HEXTE instruments aboard the RXTE satellite. No noticeable variability is seen
in the emission measured by either instrument over the 8 week observation.
Fitting the RXTE data by a single thermal component we obtain $kT = 8.6 \pm
0.1$ (90% confidence limits), a low iron abundance $Z_{F_e} \sim 0.16 \pm
0.02$, and large positive residuals below 6 keV and between 15 to 30 keV. The
quality of the fit is drastically improved if a second component is added. A
two-temperature model yields $kT_{1} \simeq 10.1 \pm 0.6$, $kT_{2}\simeq 2.8
\pm 0.6$, and of $Z_{F_e} \sim 0.23 \pm 0.03$. An equally good fit is obtained
by a combination of a primary thermal and a secondary nonthermal component,
with $kT \simeq 8.9 \pm 0.6$, and power-law index $\alpha \simeq 2.4 \pm 0.3$.
We have repeated the analysis by performing joint fits to both these RXTE
measurements and archival ASCA data. At most 25% of the RXTE secondary
component could be present in the ASCA data. Allowing for this difference, very
similar results were obtained, with only somewhat different values for the
temperature and power-law index in the latter model. The deduced value of
$\alpha$ is consistent with the measured spectrum of extended radio emission.
Identifying the power-law emission as Compton scattering of the radio-emitting
electrons by the CMB, we obtain $B \sim0.1-0.3$ $\mu G$ for the volume-averaged
magnetic field, and $\sim 4 \times 10^{-14}(R/2 Mpc)^{-3}$ erg cm$^{-3}$ for
the mean energy density of the emitting electrons in the central region (radius
R) of A2319.

complete and has operated continuously since Jan. 2000. Initial studies
including searches for gamma-ray sources are ongoing, and preliminary results
are available. The final stage of construction is under way. We are deploying
170 auxiliary ""outrigger"" water Cherenkov detectors in an area of 40,000

Excess growth of uniform magnetization is shown to develop in the temperature
range T<T_x(P) as a mode-coupling effect of coupled growth of SDW and CDW
orderings, which has been observed by two different types of experiments. The
coupled CDW and SDW fluctuations are shown to be essentially ferromagnetic spin
fluctuations which induce a spin-triplet p-wave attraction. These fluctuations
consist of two modes, spin and charge fluctuations with large momentum transfer
of the nesting vector. An anomalous temperature dependence of the upper
critical field H_c2(T) such as crossing of H_c2(T) at P=11.4 kbar and P=13.5

interaction can cause the individual stars to collapse into black holes during

a widely separated circular binary. The companion body's electric- and
magnetic-type tidal fields distort the black hole and perturb the cluster,
eventually causing the cluster to collapse into the hole as the companion
spirals in under the influence of gravitational radiation reaction. We find
that magnetic-type tidal forces do not significantly influence the evolution of
the cluster as a whole. However, individual orbits can be strongly affected by
these forces. For example, some orbits are destabilized due to the addition of
magnetic-type tidal forces. We find that the most stable orbits are close to
the companion's orbital plane and retrograde with respect to the companion's
orbit.

with sources given by the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor of

Langevin equation, which has in addition sources due to the noise kernel. The
noise kernel is the expectation value of the stress-energy bi-tensor which
describes the fluctuations of quantum matter fields. Here, we first give an
axiomatic derivation of the Einstein-Langevin equations and then show how they
can also be derived by the original method based on the influence functional.
As a first application we solve these equations and compute the two- point
correlation functions for the linearized Einstein tensor and for the metric
perturbations in a Minkowski background. We then turn to the important issue of
the validity of semiclassical gravity by examining the criteria based on the
ratio of the variance of fluctuations of the stress-energy tensor of a quantum
field to its mean. We show a calculation of these quantities for a massless
scalar field in the Minkowski and the Casimir vacua as a function of an
intrinsic scale defined by introducing a smeared field or by point separation.
Contrary to prior claims, the ratio of variance to mean-squared being of the
order unity does not necessarily imply the failure of semiclassical gravity.
Next we use the point-separation method to derive a general expression for a
regularized noise-kernel for quantum fields in general curved spacetimes. Using
these expressions one could investigate a host of important problems in early
universe and black hole physics.

second-class nature of the quantum gravitational constraints, it is
advantageous to use the recently developed projection operator method, which
treats all quantum constraints on an equal footing. Using this method,
enforcement of regularized versions of the gravitational operator constraints
is formulated quite naturally by means of a novel and relatively well-defined
functional integral involving only the same set of variables that appears in
the usual classical formulation. It is anticipated that skills and insight to
study this formulation can be developed by studying special, reduced-variable
models that still retain some basic characteristics of gravity, specifically a
partial second-class constraint operator structure. Although perturbatively
nonrenormalizable, gravity may possibly be understood nonperturbatively from a
hard-core perspective that has proved valuable for specialized models. Finally,

size of phase space domains in rapidity, azimuthal angle and transverse

positive genuine correlations. One-dimensional cumulants initially increase
rapidly with decreasing size of the phase space cells but saturate quickly. In

in neutral current and charged current DIS is studied within the variable

purpose all the relevant partonic subprocesses have been calculated to order
O(\alpha_s^1) for general masses and couplings taking into account massive
initial state quark-partons as needed in the variable flavor number scheme of
ACOT. By the calculation of the before missing radiative corrections to
scattering amplitudes on massive quark partons the ACOT scheme could be
completed to full order O(\alpha_s^1). These results might also prove useful
for studying the intrinsic charm content of nucleons. In the second part the
parton content of pions and real and virtual photons is analyzed in leading
order (LO) and next-to-leading oder (NLO) QCD within the framework of the
radiative parton model of Gl\""uck, Reya, and Vogt (GRV). Furthermore, the
factorization of the cross section for the process e^+ e^- -> e^+ e^- X into
fluxes of transverse/longitudinal target photons and the cross sections for
deep inelastic scattering off these target photons is investigated in detail.
It is demonstrated that the factorization remains valid also for virtual P^2 \=
0 target photons in the Bjorken limit P^2 << Q^2. However, the neglected terms
are of the order O(\sqrt{P^2/Q^2}) only and not of the order O(P^2/Q^2) as

been calculated in lowest order perturbation theory according to the doubly

naturally in the theory of black box finite groups and in the Andrews-Curtis

  We suggest an approach to the Andrews-Curtis conjecture based on the study of
Andrews-Curtis graphs of finite groups, discuss properties of Andrews-Curtis
graphs of some classes of finite groups and results of computer experiments
with generation of random elements of finite groups by random walks on their
Andrews-Curtis graphs.

  0-8218-3340-5",,,"math.AT math.RT",,"  An n-dimensional \mu-component boundary link is a codimension 2 embedding of
spheres L=\bigsqcup_{\mu}S^n \subset S^{n+2} such that there exist \mu disjoint
oriented embedded (n+1)-manifolds which span the components of L. An F_\mu-link
is a boundary link together with a cobordism class of such spanning manifolds.
The F_\mu-link cobordism group C_n(F_\mu) is known to be trivial when n is even
but not finitely generated when n is odd.
  Our main result is an algorithm to decide whether two odd-dimensional
F_\mu-links represent the same cobordism class in C_{2q-1}(F_\mu) assuming q>1.
We proceed to compute the isomorphism class of C_{2q-1}(F_\mu), generalizing
Levine's computation of the knot cobordism group C_{2q-1}(F_1).
  Our starting point is the algebraic formulation of Levine, Ko and Mio who
identify C_{2q-1}(F_\mu) with a surgery obstruction group, the Witt group
G^{(-1)^q,\mu}(Z) of \mu-component Seifert matrices. We obtain a complete set
of torsion-free invariants by passing from integer coefficients to complex
coefficients and by applying the algebraic machinery of Quebbemann, Scharlau
and Schulte. Signatures correspond to `algebraically integral' simple self-dual
representations of a certain quiver (directed graph with loops). These
representations, in turn, correspond to algebraic integers on an infinite
disjoint union of real affine varieties.
  To distinguish torsion classes, we consider rational coefficients in place of
complex coefficients, expressing G^{(-1)^q,\mu}(Q) as an infinite direct sum of
Witt groups of finite-dimensional division Q-algebras with involution.
Numerical invariants of such Witt groups are available in the literature.
