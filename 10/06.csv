region also shows higher surface brightness and is surrounded by a large
ring-like hot region with kT > 7 keV, and likely to be a remnant of a merger
with a poor cluster. Another extended cool region is extending outward from the

  201, eds. Grebel, Geisler, Minniti, 2001",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Star formation is triggered in essentially three ways: (1) the pressures from
existing stars collect and squeeze nearby dense gas into gravitationally
unstable configurations, (2) random compression from supersonic turbulence
makes new clouds and clumps, some of which are gravitationally unstable, and
(3) gravitational instabilities in large parts of a galaxy disk make giant new
clouds and spiral arms that fragment by the other two processes into a
hierarchy of smaller star-forming pieces. Examples of each process are given.
Most dense clusters in the solar neighborhood were triggered by external
stellar pressures. Most clusters and young stars on larger scales are organized
into hierarchical patterns with an age-size correlation, suggestive of
turbulence. Beads-on-a-string of star formation in spiral arms and resonance
rings indicate gravitational instabilities. The turbulence model explains the
mass spectrum of clusters, the correlation between the fraction of star
formation in the form of clusters and the star formation rate, found by Larsen
& Richtler, and the correlation between the size of the largest cluster and the

gravitational instabilities and turbulence triggering when the ambient density
is so high that the local dynamical time scale is less than the lifetime of an

based on two linear relationships on large scales: 1) the relation between the
fluctuations of the transmission and the underlying density field, and 2) the
relation between the density fluctuations and the peculiar velocity field. We
show that, with a multiscale decomposition, the two relations can be
effectively employed for predicting the rms bulk velocity. Since QSO's
Ly$\alpha$ forest is due to the absorptions of diffusely distributed and
photoionized IGM, this method provides an independent estimate of the rms bulk
velocity at high redshifts, on large scales, and free from the bias of
galaxies. Using the transmitted flux of 60 moderate-resolution QSO spectra, the
rms bulk velocity is found to be 230$\pm$50 km s$^{-1}$ around redshift

the M81 group of galaxies (distance 3.6Mpc). HoI is a low-mass, low surface-
brightness dwarf galaxy. High-resolution multi-array VLA HI observations reveal
a supergiant shell (diameter: 1.7 kpc) which covers about half the optical
extent of HoI and which comprises 75% of the total HI content (total HI mass:
1.1 10^8 M_o). We set a tentative upper limit to the dark matter content of <
3.1 10^8 M_o. The HI data are complemented by deep, optical UBV(RI)_c and
Halpha observations obtained at the Calar Alto 2.2m telescope. We find M_HI/L_B
= 1.1 M_o/L_B_o. The total visible (stars plus gas) mass of HoI adds up to 2.4
10^8 M_o. This leads to a total mass of < 5.5 10^8 M_o. The origin of HoI's
peculiar HI morphology is discussed in terms of a supergiant shell created by
strong stellar winds and supernova explosions (energy: equiv. 20-260 type II
SN; age: 80+-20 Myr). The morphological center of HoI is offset by 0.75 kpc
with respect to the dynamical center. Within the interior of the shell the
light distribution is exponential with a rather shallow gradient and blue
optical colors. Beyond a radius corresponding to an HI column density of 10^21
cm^-2, the putative star formation (SF) threshold, the disk becomes
considerably redder and the slope for the exponential light distribution
steepens. It is speculated that a generation of stars (age 15-30 Myr) is the
result of secondary SF on the rim of the shell. Based on the global morphology
and velocity dispersion as well as the location of the HII regions we find
evidence for ram pressure within the M81 group. Finally, we discuss the
likelihood of HoI having lost some of its interstellar material to the
intergalactic medium (''blow-out'' scenario).

identification of line profile differences which are assumed to be generated
from fluctuations within a turbulent velocity field. The variation of these
velocity differences with spatial scale within a molecular region is described
by a singular power law, delta v= c L^alpha which can be used as a powerful
diagnostic to turbulent motions. For the ensemble of 23 fields, we find a mean
value alpha = 0.62 +- 0.11. From a recent calibration of this method using
fractal Brownian motion simulations (Brunt & Heyer 2001), the measured velocity
difference-size relationship corresponds to an energy spectrum, E(k), which
varies as k^-beta, where beta = 2.17 +- 0.31. We compare our results to both
decaying and forced hydrodynamic simulations of turbulence. We conclude that
energy must be continually injected into the regions to replenish that lost by
dissipative processes such as shocks. The absence of large, widely distributed
shocks within the targeted fields suggests that the energy is injected at
spatial scales less than several pc.

structure has decreasing surface brightness with increasing distance from the
bright core, characteristic of FRI sources (Fanaroff & Riley 1974). Its radio
luminosity at 5GHz falls in the classification for `radio-quiet' quasars (it is
only 10^23.9 W/Hz/sr; see e.g. Kellermann et al 1994). Its radio luminosity at
151MHz (which is 10^25.3 W/Hz/sr) is at the transition luminosity observed to
separate FRIs and FRIIs. Hitherto, no optically-powerful quasar had been found
to have a conventional FRI radio structure. For searches at low-frequency this
is unsurprising given current sensitivity and plausible radio spectral indices
for radio-quiet quasars. We demonstrate the inevitability of the extent of any
FRqI radio structures being seriously under-estimated by existing targetted
follow-up observations of other optically-selected quasars, which are typically
short exposures of z > 0.3 objects, and discuss the implications for the

precessing (cf. Galactic jet sources such as SS433). A possible explanation for
this is that its central engine is a binary whose black holes have yet to
coalesce. The ubiquity of precession in `radio-quiet' quasars, perhaps as a
means of reducing the observable radio luminosity expected in highly-accreting
systems, remains to be established.

high-redshift galaxies, is shown to be horribly unstable, even when modeling
one-component systems such as elliptical, dwarf elliptical and pure exponential

also heavily dependent on the radial extent, and hence exposure depth, of any
given galaxy. We show that the recently defined central concentration index is
remarkably stable against changes to the outer radius, providing a meaningful
and reliable estimate of galaxy concentration. The index n from the r^(1/n)
models is shown to be monotonically related with the central concentration of
light, giving the index n a second and perhaps more tangible meaning. With a
sample of elliptical and dwarf elliptical galaxies, we present correlations
between the central light concentration and the global parameters: luminosity
(Pearson's r = -0.82), effective radius (r = 0.67), central surface brightness
(r = -0.88), and velocity dispersion (r = 0.80). The more massive elliptical
galaxies are shown to be more centrally concentrated. We speculate that the
physical mechanism behind the recently observed correlation between the central
velocity dispersion (mass) of a galaxy and the mass of its central supermassive
black hole may be connected with the central galaxy concentration. That is, we
hypothesize that it may not simply be the amount of mass in a galaxy but rather
how that mass is distributed that controls the mass of the central black hole.

The term ""modern"" in the title refers to the fact that the quantum theory is
based on formulating classical general relativity as a theory of connections
rather than metrics as compared to in original version due to Arnowitt, Deser
and Misner. Canonical quantum general relativity is an attempt to define a
mathematically rigorous, non-perturbative, background independent theory of
Lorentzian quantum gravity in four spacetime dimensions in the continuum. The
approach is minimal in that one simply analyzes the logical consequences of
combining the principles of general relativity with the principles of quantum
mechanics. The requirement to preserve background independence has lead to new,
fascinating mathematical structures which one does not see in perturbative
approaches, e.g. a fundamental discreteness of spacetime seems to be a
prediction of the theory providing a first substantial evidence for a theory in
which the gravitational field acts as a natural UV cut-off. An effort has been
made to provide a self-contained exposition of a restricted amount of material
at the appropriate level of rigour which at the same time is accessible to
graduate students with only basic knowledge of general relativity and quantum
field theory on Minkowski space.

two-dimensional QCD (QCD_2) in the formulation with SU(N_c) currents. Together
with the results in the bosonic sector this allows to address the as yet
unresolved task of finding the single-particle states of this theory as a
function of the ratio of the numbers of flavors and colors, \lambda=N_f/N_c,
anew. We construct the Hamiltonian matrix in DLCQ formulation as an algebraic
function of the harmonic resolution K and the continuous parameter \lambda.
Amongst the more surprising findings in the fermionic sector chiefly considered
here is that the fermion momentum is a function of \lambda. This dependence is
necessary in order to reproduce the well-known 't Hooft and large N_f spectra.
Remarkably, those spectra have the same single-particle content as the ones in
the bosonic sectors. The twist here is the dramatically different sizes of the
Fock bases in the two sectors, which makes it possible to interpret in
principle all states of the discrete approach. The hope is that some of this
insight carries over into the continuum. We also present some new findings
concerning the single-particle spectrum of the adjoint theory.

frequency, induced by an external damping on a system in heat contact with
internal fluctuating impurities. Those impurities can move among locations and
their oscillations are associated with a loss function depending on the model.
The fluctuation properties of the system are provided by a potential function
shaped by wells, in such a way that jumps between the stationary positions are
allowed. The power spectral density associated with this dissipation mechanism
shows a f^(-gamma)tail. The interest of this problem is that many systems are
characterized by a typical f^(-\gamma) spectral tail at low frequency. The
model presented in this article is based on a threshold type behaviour and its
generality allows applications in several fields. The effects of an external
force, introduced to produce damping, are studied by using both analytical
techniques and numerical simulations. The results obtained with the present
model show that no reduction of the power spectral density is appreciable below
the main peak of the spectral density.
