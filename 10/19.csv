has led us to examine whether earlier non-equilibrium models of dwarf
spheroidal satellites without any dark matter should be reconsidered in more
detail. Such models can explain the high dispersion of the dwarf spheroids by
the projection of disrupted tidal debris. We show in the case of Milky Way
satellites, that these models predict a significant spread in the apparent
magnitude of horizontal branch stars which is correlated with sky position and
velocity. In particular, the models produce a strong correlation of radial
velocity with the long axis of the dwarf. Current data do not set strong enough
constraints on the models, but we suggest that photometric and spectroscopic
surveys of extra-tidal stars of nearby dwarf spheroids in the Milky Way and
Andromeda can falsify these models without dark matter.

family up to high z, and supports the standard picture of structure formation
for the dark matter component. Because of the intrinsic regularity in the hot
cluster population, the scaled profiles can be used as distance indicators, the
correct cosmology being the one for which the profiles at different redshifts
coincide. The present data allow us to put a tight constraint on Omega0 for a
flat Universe: Omega0=0.40^{+0.15}_{-0.12} at 90% confidence level (statistical

clusters and semicircular shape. Its physical dimensions are about the same as
for the local Gould Belt, but the stellar density is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude
higher. In addition to an extremely luminous, 15 Myr old cluster discussed in
an earlier paper, accounting for about 17% of the integrated V-band light, we
identify 18 stellar clusters within the complex with luminosities similar to
the brightest open clusters in the Milky Way. The color-magnitude diagram of
individual stars in the complex shows a paucity of red supergiants compared to
model predictions in the 10-20 Myr age range for a uniform star formation rate.
We thus find tentative evidence for a gap in the dispersed star formation
history, with a concentration of star formation into a young globular cluster
during this gap. Confirmation of this result must, however, await a better
understanding of the late evolution of stars in the corresponding mass range (>
12 Msun). A reddening map based on individual reddenings for 373 early-type

previously identified on ground-based images. We finally discuss various

\epsilon_{UV}\fesc. It is almost independent of the assumed star formation
efficiency parameter, \epsilon_*, and the intensity of the dissociating
background. The main feedback process that regulates the SF is the re-formation
of H_2 in front of HII regions and inside relic HII regions. The HII regions
remain confined inside filaments, maximizing the production of H_2 in overdense

groups are abundant and therefore have a large covering fraction on the sky,
lensing by groups is likely to be very important observationally. Besides, it
has recently become clear that many lens models for strong lensing by
individual galaxies require external shear to reproduce the observed image
geometries; in many cases a nearby group is detected that could provide this
shear. In this work, we study the expected lensing behavior of galaxy groups in
both the weak and strong lensing regime. We examine the shear and magnification
produced by a group and its dependence on the detailed mass distribution within
the group. We find that the peak value of the weak lensing shear signal is of
the order of 3 per cent and varies by a factor of about 2 for different mass
distributions. These variations are large enough to be detectable in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In the strong lensing regime we find that the image
geometries and typical magnifications are sensitive to the group properties and
that groups can easily provide enough external shear to produce quadruple
images. We investigate the statistical properties of lensing galaxies that are
near or part of a group and find that statistical lens properties, like the
distribution of time delays, are affected measurably by the presence of the
group which can therefore introduce an additional systematic error in the
measurement of the Hubble constant from such systems. We conclude that both the
detection of weak lensing by groups and accurate observations of strong galaxy
lens systems near groups could provide important information on the total mass
and matter distribution within galaxy groups.

These UV spectra show strong SiIV, and CIV emission, and large quantities of
sharp (~40 km/s) H2 lines. All the H2 lines belong to the Lyman band and all
the observed lines are single peaked and optically thin. The averages of all
the H2 lines centroids for each star are negative which may indicate that they
come from an outflow. We interpret the emission in H2 as being due to
fluorescence, mostly by Ly_alpha, and identify seven excitation routes within 4
A of that line. We obtain column densities (10^12 to 10^15 cm^-2) and optical
depths (~1 or less) for each exciting transition. We conclude that the
populations are far from being in thermal equilibrium. We do not observe any
lines excited from the far blue wing of Ly_alpha, which implies that the
molecular features are excited by an absorbed profile. SiIV and CIV (corrected
for H2 emission) have widths of ~200 km/s, and an array of centroids
(blueshifted lines, centered, redshifted). These characteristics are difficult
to understand in the context of current models of the accretion shock. For DR
Tau we observe transient strong blueshifted emission, perhaps the a result of
reconnection events in the magnetosphere. We also see evidence of multiple
emission regions for the hot lines. While CIV is optically thin in most stars
in our sample, SiIV is not. However, CIV is a good predictor of SiIV and H2
emission. We conclude that most of the flux in the hot lines may be due to
accretion processes, but the line profiles can have multiple and variable
components.

ubiquitous presence of voids. However, voids have not been extensively studied
due to observational limitations. Until recently, galaxy redshift surveys
included only a few voids of diameter > 30 h-1Mpc.
  The first step in studying voids is the identification process. We outline a
method for detecting voids (based on the method of El-Ad and Piran 1997, EP97).
We apply it to the PSCz survey, and the Updated Zwicky Catalog. We find that
voids have typical diameters of ~30 h-1Mpc and are very underdense regions with
(delta rho)/rho ~ -0.95. Up to 40% of volume of the Universe is occupied by
voids. We discuss the results from these surveys and our detection algorithm's
usefulness for future surveys.
  The next generation of surveys (such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and
2dFGRS) will improve this situation. The surveys will extend to greater depths,
allowing a more statistically complete sample of voids to be obtained and the
accompanying digital imaging will provide accurate photometry of fainter
objects. This will allow us to gain greater insight into the nature of voids,
search for possible void galaxies and maybe place constraints on cosmological
parameters as voids play a critical role in the evolution of large scale
structure.

repulsive or attractive. For a repulsive small-small interaction, the effective
force follows the trends as predicted by a mapping onto an effective
non-additive hard-core mixture: both a depletion attraction and an accumulation
repulsion caused by small spheres adsorbing onto the big ones can be obtained
depending on the sign of the big-small interaction. For repulsive big-small
interactions, the effect of adding a small-small attraction also follows the
trends predicted by the mapping. But a more subtle ``repulsion through
attraction'' effect arises when both big-small and small-small attractions
occur: upon increasing the strength of the small-small interaction, the
effective potential becomes more repulsive. We have further tested several
theoretical methods against our computer simulations: The superposition
approximation works best for an added big-small repulsion, and breaks down for
a strong big-small attraction, while density functional theory is very accurate
for any big-small interaction when the small particles are pure hard-spheres.

coagulation equation for a rate coefficient of the form A_ij \propto (i^mu j^nu
+ i^nu j^mu) and monodisperse initial conditions. The results confirm that
there are three classes of rate coefficients with qualitatively different
solutions. For nu \leq 1 and lambda = mu + nu \leq 1, the numerical solution
evolves in an orderly fashion and tends toward a self-similar solution at large
time t. The properties of the numerical solution in the scaling limit agree
with the analytic predictions of van Dongen and Ernst. In particular, for the
subset with mu > 0 and lambda < 1, we disagree with Krivitsky and find that the
scaling function approaches the analytically predicted power-law behavior at
small mass, but in a damped oscillatory fashion that was not known previously.
For nu \leq 1 and lambda > 1, the numerical solution tends toward a
self-similar solution as t approaches a finite time t_0. The mass spectrum n_k
develops at t_0 a power-law tail n_k \propto k^{-tau} at large mass that
violates mass conservation, and runaway growth/gelation is expected to start at
t_crit = t_0 in the limit the initial number of particles n_0 -> \infty. The
exponent tau is in general less than the analytic prediction (lambda + 3)/2,
and t_0 = K/[(lambda - 1) n_0 A_11] with K = 1--2 if lambda > 1.1. For nu > 1,
the behaviors of the numerical solution are similar to those found in a
previous paper by us. They strongly suggest that there are no self-consistent
solutions at any time and that runaway growth is instantaneous in the limit n_0
-> \infty. They also indicate that the time t_crit for the onset of runaway
growth decreases slowly toward zero with increasing n_0.

found at the initial stage of film growth, a regime not explored in detail
prior to the present work. As the temperature was lowered, a positive
temperature coefficient of resistance (dR/dT > 0) emerged, with the resistance
reaching a minimum before the dR/dT became negative again. This behavior was
accompanied by a non-linear and asymmetric I-V characteristic. As the film
became thicker, conventional variable-range hopping (VRH) was recovered. We
attribute the observed crossover in the electrical transport properties to an

the relationships that exist between concepts, problems, and solution patterns
from different fields of human activity in the form of a graph. Our approach is
based upon generalization and specialization relationships and problem solving.
It is simple enough to be understood quite easily, and general enough to enable
coherent integration of concepts and problems from virtually any field. We have
built an implementation which uses the World Wide Web as a support to allow
navigation between graph nodes and collaborative development of the graph.

privacy of mobile communication systems, both voice and data. Most proposals
attempt to provide incremental improvements to systems that are deployed today.
Indeed, only incremental improvements are possible, given the regulatory,
technological, economic, and historical structure of the telecommunications
system. In this paper, we conduct a ``thought experiment'' to redesign the
mobile communications system to provide a high level of security and privacy
for the users of the system. We discuss the important requirements and how a
different architecture might successfully satisfy them. In doing so, we hope to
illuminate the possibilities for secure and private systems, as well as explore
their real limits.

The diffractive nature of the production mechanism is investigated via
extraction of the Pomeron trajectory at high Q^2. Flavor symmetry is observed
in the phi/rho ratios in the same region of momentum transfer where the
power-law scaling becomes similar. The multivariable helicity analyses impose
stringent constraints on models for the vacuum-exchange production mechanism.
Semi-exclusive photoproduction of transverse rho and phi mesons at momentum
transfers far exceeding their mass scale exhibit a hard scaling behavior which
appears to violate the QCD helicity selection rules in a two-gluon exchange

can be done by describing all fields in terms on p-jets, living on the

Such a description is necessary to construct well-defined representations the
N-dimensional generalization of the Virasoro algebra Vir(N); this is the
natural quantum extension of vect(N), which is the correct symmetry algebra of
general relativity in N dimensions. The limit p -> oo, necessary for a field

probabilities and thus there is no room for the description of dissipative
systems in Quantum Mechanics. The treatment of time-irreversible evolution (the
arrow of time) is therefore ruled out by definition in Quantum Mechanics. In
Quantum Field Theory it is, however, possible to describe time-irreversible
evolution by resorting to the existence of infinitely many unitarily
inequivalent representations of the canonical commutation relations (ccr). In
this paper I review such a result by discussing the canonical quantization of
the damped harmonic oscillator (dho), a prototype of dissipative systems. The
irreversibility of time evolution is expressed as tunneling among the unitarily
inequivalent representations. The exact action for the dho is derived in the
path integral formalism of the quantum Brownian motion developed by Schwinger
and by Feynman and Vernon. The doubling of the phase-space degrees of freedom
for dissipative systems is related to quantum noise effects. Finally, the role
of dissipation in the quantum model of the brain and the occurrence that the
cosmological arrow of time, the thermodynamical one and the biological one
point into the same direction are shortly mentioned.

The mechanical action turns out to be the first order system without taking the
strong field limit $B\longrightarrow\infty$. In particular, it is true for zero
mode of the string coordinate which means that the noncommutativity is
intrinsic property of this mechanical system. We describe the arbitrariness in
the relation existent between the mechanical and the string variables and show
that noncommutativity of the string variables on the boundary can be removed.

events in turbulence is studied to examine how the energy cascade is

models. This vorticity surge event is tied to the formation of the energy
cascade in a direct numerical simulation by the traditional signatures of a
turbulent energy cascade such as spectra approaching -5/3 and strongly
Beltramized vortex tubes. A coherent mechanism is suggested by the nearly
simultaneous development of a maximum of the peak vorticity
$\|\omega\|_\infty$, growth of the dissipation, the appearance of a helically
aligned local vortex configuration and strong, transient oscillations in the
helicity wavenumber spectrum. This coherence is also examined for two LES
models, a traditional purely dissipative eddy viscosity model and a modern
method (LANS$-\alpha$) that respects the nonlinear transport properties of
fluids. Both LES models properly represent the spectral energy and energy
dissipation associated with this vorticity surge event. However, only the model
that preserves nonlinear fluid transport properties reproduces the helical
properties, including Beltrami-like vortex tubes.
