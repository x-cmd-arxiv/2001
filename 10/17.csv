However, the fact that the ultraviolet spectrum is dominated by non-stellar
radiation does not prove that the dust that is thermally radiating in the far
infrared is predominantly heated by the AGN. Since the energy that we get in
the far-infrared is precisely that which is removed from the ultraviolet
spectrum, this could mean that the starburst is more dust-enshrouded than the
AGN due to a peculiar dust distribution. The limits we place on the putative
starburst contribution to the restframe ultraviolet continuum together with
constraints on the amount of extinction provides an upper limit to the star
formation rate of about 2000 Msun/yr, consistent with previously claimed high
star formation rate in this object.

Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCG) is the observed alignment of the BCGs with
their host cluster and its surroundings. We have examined the BCG-cluster
alignment effect, using clusters of galaxies detected from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that the BCGs are preferentially aligned with the
principal axis of their hosts, to a much higher redshift (z >~ 0.3) than probed
by previous studies (z <~ 0.1). The alignment effect strongly depends on the
magnitude difference of the BCG and the second and third brightest cluster
members: we find a strong alignment effect for the dominant BCGs, while less
dominant BCGs do not show any departure from random alignment with respect to
the cluster. We therefore claim that the alignment process originates from the
same process that makes the BCG grow dominant, be it direct mergers in the
early stage of cluster formation, or a later process that resembles the
galactic cannibalism scenario. We do not find strong evidence for (or against)
redshift evolution between 0<z<0.45, largely due to the insufficient sample
size (< 200 clusters). However, we have developed a framework by which we can
examine many more clusters in an automated fashion for the upcoming SDSS
cluster catalogs, which will provide us with better statistics for systematic
investigations of the alignment with redshift, richness and morphology of both
the cluster and the BCG.

The migration is divergent in the sense that the ratio of the orbital period of
the outer planet to that of the inner planet grows. As the period ratio
diverges, the planets traverse, but are not captured into, a series of
mean-motion resonances that amplify their orbital eccentricities in rough
inverse proportion to their masses. Strong viscosity gradients in

optical counterparts to the X-ray sources are divided into two distinct

to the faint blue field galaxy population, and 2) an optically brighter group,
including resolved galaxies with average colors significantly redder than the

luminosity function models of the various classes of objects. Hence, the
combination of deep X-ray data with the high spatial resolution of HST are for
the first time allowing us to probe the faint end of the AGN luminosity

galaxies are surrounded by unbound stars tidally stripped by the Milky Way. We
run high-resolution N-Body simulations of dwarf galaxies orbiting within the

matter potentials as those implied by current structure formation models. We
show that tidal forces acting on dwarfs with constant density cores or with
cuspy profiles having a low concentration parameter ($c < 5$) lead to flat
outer stellar density profiles like that of Carina for a variety of orbital
configurations. On the contrary, it is more difficult to remove stars from
cuspy dark matter halos with concentrations as high as predicted by CDM models
at the mass scale of dwarf galaxies ($c \simgt 10$) and the data can only be
reproduced assuming nearly radial orbits. Our simulations show that Carina is
losing mass at a fractional rate $< 0.1$ Gyr$^{-1}$ and its mass-to-light ratio
could be inflated by at most a factor of 2 due to unbound stars projected along
the line of sight. We follow the evolution of the tidal debris within a
triaxial clumpy cold dark matter Milky Way halo which causes differential
precession and small scale heating of the stellar streams. This renders their
use as a dynamical tracer of the Galactic potential practically useless, but
does provide a novel test of the nature of the dark matter. Models with warm
dark matter (WDM) or fluid dark matter (FDM) produce dwarf halos with lower
central densities than CDM and would be consistent with the observed tidal
tails even for orbits with eccentricities as low as indicated by current data
on nearby dwarf spheroidals. Galactic halos in FDM are smooth and spherical and
would be favored by the detection of coherent streams.

powerful discriminant of galaxy formation models. Whereas monolithic collapse
and hierarchical, merger-driven, models suggest radically different histories
for these galaxies, neither the theoretical predictions nor the observational
data for field galaxies have been sufficiently reliable for precise conclusions
to be drawn. A major difficulty in interpreting the observations, reviewed
here, concerns the taxonomic definition of spheroidals in merger-based models.
Using quantitative measures of recent star formation activity drawn from the
internal properties of a sample of distant field galaxies in the Hubble Deep
Fields, we undertake a new analysis to assess the continuous formation of
spheroidal galaxies. Whereas abundances and redshift distributions of modelled
spheroidals are fairly insensitive to their formation path, we demonstrate that
the distribution and amount of blue light arising from recent mergers provides
a more sensitive approach. With the limited resolved data currently available,
the rate of mass assembly implied by the observed colour inhomogeneities is
compared to that expected in popular Lambda-dominated cold dark matter models
of structure formation. These models produce as many highly inhomogeneous
spheroidals as observed, but underpredict the proportion of homogeneous,
passive objects. We conclude that colour inhomogeneities, particularly when
combined with spectroscopic diagnostics for large, representative samples of
field spheroidals, will be a more valuable test of their physical assembly
history than basic source counts and redshift distributions. Securing such data
should be a high priority for the Advanced Camera for Surveys on Hubble Space
Telescope.

types of models, in which: (A) baryons conserve angular momentum and (B) some
of the angular momentum of the baryons is transferred to the dark matter.
Type-A models produce good agreement with observed rotation curves and obey
constraints in the solar neighborhood, but may have too much dark matter in the
center to allow a fast rotating bar. The type-B models with angular momentum
transport have a slightly more massive disk and less dark matter in the central
part, allowing a fast rotating bar to persist. Both classes of models probably
have sufficient baryonic mass in the central 3.5kpc to reproduce recent
observational values of the optical depth to microlensing events towards the
Galactic center. All models require that about 1/2 of all baryons expected
inside the virial radius must not be in the disk or bulge. We investigate
whether the range of virial masses allowed by our dynamical models is
compatible with constraints from the galaxy luminosity function, and find a
range of parameter space that is allowed by this constraint. We conclude that
rotation curves and dynamical properties of ``normal'' high surface brightness

The foremost examples are jets and disks orbiting spinning black holes, pulsar
winds and gamma ray bursts. As discussed at this meeting, these flows exhibit
unusual kinematic and dynamical properties, that distinguish them from
non-relativistic flows. It is possible that all collimated outflows are
essentially hydromagnetic or electromagnetic. Future study of relativistic
flows will rely heavily on numerical experiments. Model relativistic flows
provide a basis for carrying out secondary studies of the underlying plasma
physics, particle acceleration, magnetic field amplification and the emission
and transfer of radiation, particularly at shock fronts. Some current
opportunities in observation, phenomenology and theory are briefly suggested.

release energy from accreting gas and their own spin energy. Electromagnetic
field plays a large role in many of the mechanisms under active consideration.
In this article, several of the many possible ``metabolic pathways'' through
which mass, angular momentum and energy can flow around and away from black
hole magnetospheres are discussed. Particular importance is attached to the
interactions between the inflowing disk, the outflowing wind, the black hole

to the study of how gas flows around black holes and how energy is released

relativistic jets and non-relativistic, hydromagnetic winds. Some of the
different possibilities currently under investigation are briefly reviewed and
some recent clues from radio scintillation, polarization and X-ray observations
are discussed. It is argued that observations of persistent circular
polarisation in Sgr A$^\ast$ support the presence of an ordered disk magnetic
field. It is also conjectured that adiabatic, sub- and super-critical accretion
flows are demand-limited, not supply-driven and are associated with large mass
outflow as appears to be the case in Sgr A$^\ast$. This principle may have to
be modified when a massive black hole forms in a protogalaxy and this
modification may account for the proposed hole mass-bulge velocity dispersion
relation. The final stages of this process may release sufficient wind energy
from the nucleus to prevent disk formation.

such a relationship is established, termination of one of those implies
termination of the other one, i.e., the meta-interpreter preserves termination.

nonequilibrium dynamics with the goals of constructing a quantum kinetic
description that goes beyond usual Boltzmann kinetics and understanding
anomalous relaxation associated with infrared phenomena. The final part of this
thesis presents a real-time kinetic analysis of direct photon production from a

appears localized on our three brane, heavy supersymmetric bulk fields adjust
themselves and acquire a nontrivial configuration along the extra-dimension.
This phenomenon redistributes uniformly the energy density across the bulk and
the resulting energy-momentum tensor does not display any singularity
associated to the initial localized energy density on our three-brane. No jumps
across the brane are present for the derivatives of the metric and Einstein's
equations are solved by constant solutions along the fifth dimension. Our
findings make it clear that cosmological phenomena in the supersymmetric brane
world scenario must be studied taking properly into account bulk supersymmetric
states. This comment is particularly relevant when applied to (super)gravity
since in supersymmetric brane world scenarios, even though chiral matter and
gauge fields may be restricted to live on boundaries, gravity multiplets always
propagate in the bulk.

hence produces violations of rotational symmetry in the spectrum. We carry out

using a perturbative method. We assume that each two-state system (qubit)
suffers \sigma_{z} error with probability p (0\leq p\leq 1) independently at
every step in the algorithm. Considering an n-qubit density operator to which
Grover's operation is applied M times, we expand it in powers of 2Mnp and
derive its matrix element order by order under the n\to \infty limit. (In this
large n limit, we assume p is small enough, so that 2Mnp(\geq 0) can take any
real positive value or 0.) This approach gives us an interpretation about
creation of new modes caused by \sigma_{z} error and an asymptotic form of an
arbitrary order correction. Calculating the matrix element up to the fifth
order term numerically, we investigate a region of 2Mnp (perturbative
parameter) where the algorithm finds the correct item with a threshold of
probability P_{th} or more. It satisfies 2Mnp<(8/5)(1-P_{th}) around 2Mnp\simeq
0 and P_{th}\simeq 1, and this linear relation is applied to a wide range of
P_{th} approximately. This observation is similar to a result obtained by E.
Bernstein and U. Vazirani concerning accuracy of quantum gates for general
algorithms. We cannot investigate a quantum to classical phase transition of
the algorithm, because it is outside the reliable domain of our perturbation
theory.

in the famous paper of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen [18]. Recently it has been
realized that quantum entanglement is a key ingredient in quantum computation,
quantum communication and quantum cryptography ([16],[17],[6]). In this paper,
we introduce algebraic sets, which are determinantal varieties in the complex
projective spaces or the products of complex projective spaces, for the mixed
states in bipartite or multipartite quantum systems as their invariants under
local unitary transformations. These invariants are naturally arised from the
physical consideration of measuring mixed states by separable pure states. In
this way algebraic geometry and complex differential geometry of these
algebraic sets turn to be powerful tools for the understanding of quantum
enatanglement. Our construction has applications in the following important
topics in quantum information theory: 1) separability criterion, it is proved
the algebraic sets have to be the sum of the linear subspaces if the mixed
states are separable; 2) lower bound of Schmidt numbers, that is, generic low
rank bipartite mixed states are entangled in many degrees of freedom; 3)
simulation of Hamiltonians, it is proved the simulation of semi-positive
Hamiltonians of the same rank implies the projective isomorphisms of the
corresponding algebraic sets; 4) construction of bound enatanglement, examples
of the entangled mixed states which are invariant under partial transpositions
(thus PPT bound entanglement) are constructed systematically from our new
separability criterion. On the other hand many examples of entangled mixed
states with rich algebraic-geometric structure in their associated
determinantal varieties are constructed and studied from this point of view.
