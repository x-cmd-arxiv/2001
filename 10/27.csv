fraction of photometrically blue galaxies than their nearby counterparts. This
raises the important question of what environmental effects can cause the
termination of star formation between z $\approx$ 0.3 and the present. The star
formation may be truncated due to ram-pressure stripping, or the gas in the
disk may be depleted by an episode of star formation caused by some external
perturbation. To help resolve this issue, surface photometry was carried out
for a total of 70 early-type galaxies in the cluster Cl1358+62, at z $\sim$
0.33, using two-color images from the Hubble Archive. The galaxies were divided
into two categories based on spectroscopic criteria: 24 are type K+A (e.g.,
strong Balmer lines, with no visible emission lines), while the remaining 46
are in the control sample with normal spectra. Radial color profiles were
produced to see if the K+A galaxies show bluer nuclei in relation to their
surrounding disks. Specifically, a linear gradient was fit to the radial color
profile of each galaxy. We find that the K+A galaxies on average tend to have
slightly bluer gradients towards the center than the normals. A
Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test has been applied to the two sets of color
gradients. The result of the test indicates that there is only a $\sim$2%
probability that the K+A and normal samples are drawn from the same parent
distribution. There is a possible complication from a trend in the apparent
magnitude vs. color gradient relation, but overall our results favor the
centralized star formation scenario as an important process in the evolution of
galaxies in dense clusters.

stars has been proposed as a mechanism for achieving the spin rates inferred
for young pulsars. One factor that could have a significant effect on the
action of the r-mode instability is fallback of supernova remnant material. The
associated accretion torque could potentially counteract any gravitational-wave
induced spin-down, and accretion heating could affect the viscous damping rates
and hence the instability. We discuss the effects of various external agents on
the r-mode instability scenario within a simple model of supernova fallback on
to a hot young magnetized neutron star. We find that the outcome depends
strongly on the strength of the star's magnetic field. Our model is capable of
generating spin rates for young neutron stars that accord well with initial
spin rates inferred from pulsar observations. The combined action of r-mode
instability and fallback appears to cause the spin rates of neutron stars born
with very different spin rates to converge, on a timescale of about a year. The
results suggest that stars with magnetic fields $\le10^{13}$ G could emit a
detectable gravitational wave signal for perhaps several years after the
supernova event. Stars with higher fields (magnetars) are unlikely to emit a
detectable gravitational wave signal via the r-mode instability. The model also
suggests that the r-mode instability could be extremely effective in preventing
young neutron stars from going dynamically unstable to the bar-mode.

find that the northern tail has HI along its outer length, but none along its

massive stars in the disk of NGC 4038. The gas in the southern tail has a
bifurcated structure, with one filament lying along the optical tail and
another running parallel to it but with no optical counterpart. The two
filaments join just before the location of several star forming regions near
the end of the tail. The HI velocity field at the end of the tail is dominated
by strong velocity gradients which suggest that at this location the tail is
bending away from us. We delineate and examine two regions within the tail
previously identified as possible sites of a so-called ``tidal dwarf galaxy''
condensing out of the expanding tidal material. The tail velocity gradients
mask any clear kinematic signature of a self-gravitating condensation in this
region. A dynamical analysis suggest that there is not enough mass in gas alone
for either of these regions to be self-gravitating. Conversely, if they are
bound they require a significant contribution to their dynamical mass from

high dust extinction. Recently it has been discovered that EROs are strongly
clustered. Are these objects the high-redshift progenitors of present day giant
ellipticals (gEs)? Are they already massive at this epoch? Are they the
descendents of the $z\sim3$ Lyman Break Galaxies (LBG), which have also been
identified as possible high redshift progenitors of giant ellipticals? We
address these questions within the framework of the Cold Dark Matter paradigm
using an analytic model that connects the number density and clustering or bias
of an observed population with the halo occupation function (the number of
observed galaxies per halo of a given mass). We find that EROs reside in
massive dark matter halos, with average mass <M> > 1E13/h100 Msun. The
occupation function that we derive for EROs is very similar to the one we
derive for z=0, L>L* early type galaxies, whereas the occupation function for
LBGs is skewed towards much smaller host halo masses (<M> ~ 1E11 to 1E12/h100

principles. The construction uses the super-period matrix as moduli invariant
under worldsheet supersymmetry. This produces new subtle contributions to the

gauge-fixed formulas.
  The superstring measure can be computed explicitly and a simple expression in
terms of modular forms is obtained. For fixed spin structure, the measure
exhibits the expected behavior under degenerations of the surface. The measure
allows for a unique modular covariant GSO projection. Under this GSO
projection, the cosmological constant, the 1-, 2- and 3- point functions of
massless supergravitons all vanish pointwise on moduli space without the

independent long range percolation in dimensions $d=1,2$, where $x$ and $y$ a
re connected with probability $\sim\beta/\|x-y\|^{-s}$. We show that when
$d<s<2d$ the walk is transient, and when $s\geq 2d$, the walk is recurrent. The
proof of transience is based on a renormalization argument. As a corollary of
this renormalization argument, we get that for every dimension $d$, if
$d<s<2d$, then critical percolation has no infinite clusters. This result is
extended to the free random cluster model. A second corollary is that when
$d\geq 2$ and $d<s<2d$ we can erase all long enough bonds and still have an
infinite cluster. The proof of recurrence in two dimensions is based on general
stability results for recurrence in random electrical networks. In particular,
we show that i.i.d. conductances on a recurrent graph of bounded degree yield a
recurrent electrical network.

given homology class which has been successfully applied in the past is to
represent the class as a first step stably by an embedded sphere, i.e. after

virtual particle to be absorbed and emitted by its matter. As described in the
vacuum universe model, the adjacent vacuum is derived from the pre-inflationary
universe in which the pre-adjacent vacuum is absorbed by the pre-matter. This
absorbed pre-adjacent vacuum is emitted to become the added space for the
inflation in the inflationary universe whose space-time is separated from the
pre-inflationary universe. This added space is the adjacent vacuum. The
absorption of the adjacent vacuum as the added space results in the adjacent
zero space (no space), Quantum mechanics is the interaction between matter and
the three different types of vacuum: the adjacent vacuum, the adjacent zero
space, and the empty space. The absorption of the adjacent vacuum results in
the empty space superimposed with the adjacent zero space, confining the matter
in the form of particle. When the absorbed vacuum is emitted, the adjacent
vacuum can be anywhere instantly in the empty space superimposed with the
adjacent zero space where any point can be the starting point (zero point) of
space-time. Consequently, the matter that expands into the adjacent vacuum has
the probability to be anywhere instantly in the form of wavefunction. In the
vacuum universe model, the universe not only gains its existence from the
vacuum but also fattens itself with the vacuum. During the inflation, the
adjacent vacuum also generates the periodic table of elementary particles to
account for all elementary particles and their masses in a good agreement with
the observed values.
