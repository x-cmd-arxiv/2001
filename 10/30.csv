The heterogeneous sample is drawn from a variety of surveys: seven from
clusters in the Einstein Medium Sensitivity Survey, five from the Las Campanas
Distant Cluster Survey and its northern hemisphere precursor, and the remaining
four from traditional optical surveys. We find that the surface brightness
profiles of all but three of these BCGs are well described by a standard de
Vaucouleurs ($r^{1/4}$) profile out to at least $\sim2r_{e}$ and that the
biweight-estimated NICMOS effective radius of our high redshift BCGs ($r_{e} =
8.3\pm 1.4$ kpc for $H_{0} = 80$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\Omega_{m} = 0.2,
\Omega_\Lambda = 0.0$) is $\sim 2$ times smaller than that measured for a local
BCG sample. If high redshift BCGs are in dynamical equilibrium and satisfy the
same scaling relations as low redshift ones, this change in size would
correspond to a mass growth of a factor of 2 since $z \sim 0.5$. However, the
biweight-estimated WFPC2 effective radius of our sample is 18 $\pm $ 5.1 kpc,
which is fully consistent with the local sample. While we can rule out mass
accretion rates higher than a factor of 2 in our sample, the discrepancy
between our NICMOS and WFPC2 results, which after various tests we describe
appears to be physical, does not yet allow us to place strong constraints on
accretion rates below that level.

accurate proper motions and trigonometric parallaxes, without any use of
spectroscopy. Assuming that cluster members share the same velocity vector
(apart from a random dispersion), we apply a maximum-likelihood method on
astrometric data from Hipparcos to compute radial and space velocities (and
their dispersions) in the Ursa Major, Hyades, Coma Berenices, Pleiades, and
Praesepe clusters, and for the alpha Persei, Scorpius-Centaurus, and `HIP
98321' associations. The radial motion of the Hyades cluster is determined to
within 0.47 km/s (standard error), and that of its individual stars to within
0.6 km/s. For other clusters, Hipparcos data yield astrometric radial
velocities with typical accuracies of a few km/s. A comparison of these
astrometric values with spectroscopic radial velocities in the literature shows
a good general agreement and, in the case of the best-determined Hyades
cluster, also permits searches for subtle astrophysical differences, such as
evidence for enhanced convective blueshifts of F-dwarf spectra, and decreased
gravitational redshifts in giants. Similar comparisons for the Scorpius OB2
complex indicate some expansion of its associations, albeit slower than
expected from their ages. As a by-product from the radial-velocity solutions,
kinematically improved parallaxes for individual stars are obtained, enabling
Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams with unprecedented accuracy in luminosity. For the
Hyades (parallax accuracy 0.3 mas), its main sequence resembles a thin line,
possibly with wiggles in it.

past orbits of mass tracers in an expanding universe from their redshift-space
coordinates at the present epoch. The tests focus on the reconstruction of
present-day peculiar velocities using mock catalogs extracted from high
resolution $N$-body simulations. The method allows for a self-consistent
treatment of redshift-space distortions by direct minimization of a modified
action for a cosmological gravitating system. When applied to ideal, volume
limited catalogs, FAM recovers unbiased peculiar velocities with a 1-D, 1\sigma
error of ~220 km/s, if velocities are smoothed on a scale of 5 Mpc/h.
Alternatively, when no smoothing is applied, FAM predicts nearly unbiased
velocities for objects residing outside the highest density regions. In this
second case the 1\sigma$error decreases to a level of ~150 km/s. The
correlation properties of the peculiar velocity fields are also correctly
recovered on scales larger than 5 Mpc/h. Similar results are obtained when FAM
is applied to flux limited catalogs mimicking the IRAS PSCz survey. In this
case FAM reconstructs peculiar velocities with similar intrinsic random errors,
while velocity-velocity correlation properties are well reproduced beyond
scales of ~8 Mpc/h. We also show that FAM provides better velocity predictions
than other, competing methods based on linear theory or Zel'dovich
approximation. These results indicate that FAM can be successfully applied to
presently available galaxy redshift surveys such as IRAS PSCz.

recently been proposed [1] as a method for detecting statistical association
between GWs and Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). Unfortunately, the method can be
effectively used only in the case of stationary noise. In this work a different
crosscorrelation algorithm is presented, which may effectively be applied also
in non-stationary conditions for the cumulative analysis of a large number of
GRBs. The value of the crosscorrelation at zero delay, which is the only one
expected to be correlated to any astrophysical signal, is compared with the
distribution of crosscorrelation of the same data for all non-zero delays
within the integration time interval. This background distribution is gaussian,
so the statistical significance of an experimentally observed excess would be
well-defined.
  Computer simulations using real noise data of the cryogenic GW detectors
Explorer and Nautilus with superimposed delta-like signals were performed, to
test the effectiveness of the method, and theoretical estimates of its
sensitivity compared to the results of the simulation. The effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm is compared to that of other cumulative techniques, finding
that the algorithm is particularly effective in the case of non-gaussian noise
and of a large (100-1000s) and unpredictable delay between GWs and GRBs.

investigated the dynamics and structure of pre-GRB ejecta predicted in various

self-consistent way with the predictions of time dependent element diffusion
and nuclear burning. In addition, full account is taken of the evolutionary
stages prior to the white dwarf formation. In particular, we follow the
evolution of a 3 \msun model from the zero-age main sequence (the adopted
metallicity is Z=0.02) all the way from the stages of hydrogen and helium
burning in the core up to the thermally pulsing phase. After experiencing 11
thermal pulses, the model is forced to evolve towards its white dwarf
configuration by invoking strong mass loss episodes. Further evolution is
followed down to the domain of the ZZ Ceti stars on the white dwarf cooling
branch. Emphasis is placed on the evolution of the chemical abundance
distribution due to diffusion processes and the role played by hydrogen burning
during the white dwarf evolution. Furthermore, the implications of our
evolutionary models for the main quantities relevant for adiabatic pulsation
analysis are discussed. Interestingly, the shape of the Ledoux term is markedly
smoother as compared with previous detailed studies of white dwarfs. This is
translated into a different behaviour of the Brunt-Vaisala frequency.

narrow, unresolved (FWHM < 200 km/s) absorption lines from a wide range of
ionization states of N, O, Mg, Ne, Si, S, Ar, and Fe. The initial analysis of
these data, presented in Lee et al. (2001), shows that a dusty warm absorber
model adequately explains the spectral features > 0.48 keV (< 26 A). We
attribute previous reports of an apparently highly redshifted O VII edge to the
neutral Fe L absorption complex and the O VII resonance series (by transitions
higher than He $\gamma$; He $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ are also seen at lower
energies). The implied dust column density needed to explain the FeI L edge
feature agrees with that obtained from earlier reddening studies, which had
already concluded that the dust should be associated with the ionized absorber
(given the relatively lower observed X-ray absorption by cold gas). Our
findings contradict the interpretation of Branduardi-Raymont et al. (2001),
based on XMM-Newton RGS spectra, that this spectral region is dominated by
highly relativistic soft X-ray line emission originating near the central black
hole. Here we review these issues pertaining to the soft X-ray spectral
features as addressed by Lee et al., (2001). (Details found in Lee et al.,

telescope at 58 km/s resolution. We focus in particular on the chemical
abundances and kinematics of the interstellar gas and our main findings are as
follows. Even at this relatively early epoch, the ISM of this galaxy is already
highly enriched in elements released by Type II supernovae; the abundances of
O, Mg, Si, P, and S are all about 2/5 of their solar values. In contrast, N and
the Fe-peak elements Mn, Fe, and Ni are underabundant by a factor of about 3.
Based on current ideas of stellar nucleosynthesis, these results can be
understood if most of the metal enrichment in cB58 has taken place within the
last 300 million years, the timescale for the release of N from intermediate
mass stars. cB58 appears to be an example of a galaxy in the process of
converting its gas into stars on a few dynamical timescales; quite possibly we
are witnessing the formation of a galactic bulge or an elliptical galaxy. The
energetic star formation activity has stirred the interstellar medium to high
velocities of up to 1000 km/s. The net effect is a bulk outflow of the ISM at a
speed of 255 km/s and at a rate which exceeds the star formation rate. It is
unclear whether this gas will be lost or retained by the galaxy. We point out
that the chemical and kinematic properties of cB58 are markedly different from
those of most damped Lyman alpha systems at the same redshift.

energy-injection from a new-born pulsar to interpret the deviation of afterglow
light curves of GRBs from those with the simple power law behavior, a beaming

ignored in earlier investigations. We explicitly include the beaming effect and
consider a change of the beaming with time due to a dynamical evolution of a

indeed first decreases with time, subsequently rises, and declines again. One
of the most peculiar optical afterglows light curve of GRB 970508 can be

rotation of the observed very young solar-type stars like AB Dor and PZ Tel.
Due to its rapid rotation a nonuniform energy flux leaves the stellar core so
that the outer convection zone is nonuniformly heated from below. Due to this
`gravity darkening' of the equator a meridional flow is created flowing
equatorwards at the surface and thus accelerating the equatorial rotation. The
effect linearly grows with the normalized pole-equator difference, \epsilon, of
the heat-flux at the bottom of the convection zone. A rotation rate of about 9
h leads to \epsilon=0.1 for a solar-type star. In this case the resulting
equator-pole differences of the angular velocity at the stellar surface,
\delta\Omega, varies from unobservable 0.005/day to the (desired) value of 0.03
day$^{-1}$ when the dimensionless diffusivity factors $c_\nu$ and c_\chi vary
between 1 and 0.1 (standard value c_\nu \simeq c_\chi \simeq 0.3, see Table 1.)
In all cases the related temperature differences between pole and equator at
the surface are unobservably small.
  The (clockwise) meridional circulation which we obtain flows opposite to the
(counterclockwise) circulation appearing as a byproduct in the \Lambda-theory
of the nonuniform rotation in outer convection zones. The consequences of this
situation for those dynamo theories of stellar activity are discussed which
work with the meridional circulation as the dominant magnetic-advection effect
in latitude to produce the solar-like form of the butterfly diagram.

observations show a good match with previous ground-based observations and with

minimisation technique to systematically find best fit parameters for the

temperature scale for M dwarfs. We consider that this could be a consequence of
problems with the Partridge & Schwenke linelist which leads to synthetic
spectra predicting water bands which are too strong for a given temperature.
Such problems need to be solved in the next generation of water vapour line

framework of the Planck mission. Dipoles observations can be used in three
ways: (i) It gives a measurement of the peculiar velocity of our Galaxy which
is an important observation in large scale structures formation model. (ii)
Measuring the dipole can give unprecedent information on the monopole (that can
be in some cases hard to obtain due to large foreground contaminations). (iii)
The dipole can be an ideal absolute calibrator, easily detectable in
cosmological experiments. Following the last two objectives, the main goal of
the work presented here is twofold. First, we study the accuracy of the
Planck-HFI calibration using the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) dipole
measured by COBE as well as the Earth orbital motion dipole. We show that we
can reach for HFI, a relative calibration between rings of about 1% and an
absolute calibration better than 0.4% for the CMB channels (in the end, the
absolute calibration will be limited by the uncertainties on the CMB
temperature). We also show that Planck will be able to measure the CMB dipole
direction at better than 1.7 arcmin and improve on the amplitude. Second, we
investigate the detection of the Cosmic Far-Infrared Background (FIRB) dipole.
Measuring this dipole could give a new and independent determination of the
FIRB for which a direct determination is quite difficult due to Galactic dust
emission contamination. We show that such a detection would require a Galactic
dust emission removal at better than 1%, which will be very hard to achieve.

1/2Ba$^{2+}$, and 1/2Pb$^{2+}$; B = Fe$^{3+}$, Cr$^{3+}$, and V$^{3+}$).
Additional chemical tuning of the exchange between layers is also possible by
substitution of the (SO4)$^{2-}$ groups by (SeO4)$^{2-}$ or (CrO4)$^{2-}$.
Thus, a variety of S = 5/2, 3/2, and 1 systems can be engineered to allow study
of the effects of frustration in both the classical and more quantum limits.
Within this family both conventional long-ranged magnetic order and more exotic
unconventional orderings have been found. This article reviews the different
types of magnetic orderings that occur and examines some of the parameters that
are their cause.

the rates of semileptonic B decays into P-wave $D_J(j)$ mesons, where $j = {1
\over 2}$ (wide states) or $j = {3 \over 2}$ (narrow states). The leading order
sum rules of Bjorken and Uraltsev suggest $\Gamma [ \bar{B} \to D_{0,1} ({1

rule for the subleading $1/m_Q$ curent matrix element correction $\xi_3(1)$.
The problem is made explicit in relativistic quarks models \`a la Bakamjian and
Thomas, that give a transparent physical interpretation of the latter as due,
not to a $L \cdot S$ force, but to the Wigner rotation of the light quark spin.
We point out moreover that the selection rule for decay constants of $j = {3

the opposite hierarchy $\Gamma [ \bar{B} \to \bar{D}_{s_{1,2}} ({3 \over 2})

with a classical field phi(x) as it travels directly from point A to point B.
The field has the property that its integrated value is an integer multiple of
some constant. The problem is to determine whether the integer is odd or even.
This task can be performed perfectly if S is a qubit. On the otherhand, if S is
a classical system then we show that it must carry an arbitrarily large amount
of classical information. We identify the physical reason for such a huge
quantum advantage, and show that it also implies a large difference between the
size of quantum and classical memories necessary for some computations. We also

interaction of a harmonically trapped ion with a laser beam, it is possible to
find one or more exact eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, with no approximations
except the optical rotating-wave approximation. These are related via a unitary
equivalence to exact eigenstates of the full Jaynes-Cummings model (including
counter-rotating terms) supplemented by a static driving term.

states $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|H>|V>+|V>|H>)$ in a controllable way. This scheme
requires single-photon sources, linear optical elements and photon detectors.
It generates the entanglement of spatially separated photons. The interaction
takes place in the photon detectors. We also show that the same idea can be
used to produce the entangled $N$-photon state
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0,N>+|N,0>)$

on phase space that are introduced in quantisation procedures (namely a U(1)
bundle and connection). The relation can be proved in both the relativistic and
the non-relativistic domain (in fact for any symmetry group including internal
symmetries) without quantum field theory, by the requirement that the exchange
can be implemented smoothly by a class of symmetry transformations that project
in the phase space of the joint system. We discuss the interpretation of this
requirement, stressing the fact that any distinction of identical particles
comes solely from the choice of coordinates. We then examine our construction
in the geometric and the coherent-state-path-integral quantisation schemes. In
the appendix we apply our results to exotic systems exhibiting continuous
``spin'' and ``fractional statistics''. This gives novel and unusual forms of
the spin-statistics relation.
