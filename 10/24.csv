(8'-14' for EMOS; hereafter the central and the outer zones), where the
temperature is almost constant, to carry out the detailed abundance
measurements of O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe and Ni using EPIC-PN (EPN) and
-MOS (EMOS) data. First, we find that the element abundance pattern in the
central compared to the outer zone in M87 is characterized by SN Ia enrichment
of a high (roughly solar) ratio of Si-group elements (Si, S, Ar, Ca) to Fe,
implying that Si burning in SN Ia is highly incomplete. In nucleosynthesis
modeling this is associated with either a lower density of the
deflagration-detonation transition and/or lower C/O and/or lower central
ignition density and observationally detected as optically subluminous SNe Ia
in early-type galaxies. Second, we find that SN Ia enrichment has a
systematically lower ratio of the Si-group elements to Fe by 0.2 dex in the
outer zone associated with the ICM of the Virgo cluster. We find that such a
ratio and even lower values by another 0.1 dex are a characteristic of the ICM
in many clusters using observed Si:S:Fe ratios as found with ASCA. Third, the
Ni/Fe ratio in the central zone of M87 is 1.5+/-0.3 solar (meteoritic), while
values around 3 times solar are reported for other clusters. In modeling of SN
Ia, this implies a reduced influence of fast deflagration SN Ia models in the
chemical enrichment of M87's ISM. Thus, to describe the SN Ia metal enrichment
in clusters, both deflagration as well as delayed detonation scenarios are
required, supporting a similar conclusion, derived from optical studies on SNe
Ia. Abridged.

  The luminosity function of the spectroscopically confirmed PNe shows a

suggests that the rim is cool. We show that the cool bright rim cannot be the
result of shock induced cooling, or due to the effect of magnetic fields in

rising cavity. This requires some means of communicating the bouyant force on
the cavity to the surrounding gas. The magnetic field required to produce the
Faraday rotation in Hydra A has the appropriate properties for this, if the
Faraday screen is mainly in this bright rim. In Hydra A, the mass outflow due

preventing the build up of low entropy gas in the cluster core.

of star-forming galaxies at intermediate redshifts of $0.2\le z\le 0.6$ in both

for measurement of the SFA, and $R$-band absolute magnitude, $M_R$, for the
luminosity. In less-luminous ($M_R \gsim -20.7$) galaxies, we find : (1) the
mean EW([O{\sc ii}]) of cluster galaxies is smaller than that of field
galaxies; but (2) some cluster galaxies have as large EW([O{\sc ii}]) as that
of actively star-forming field galaxies. Based on both our results, we discuss
a new possible mechanism for the Butcher-Oemler (BO) effect, assuming that the
luminosity of a galaxy is proportional to its dynamical mass. Our proposal is
that BO galaxies are less-massive cluster galaxies with smaller peculiar
velocities. They are then stable against Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI),
and are not affected by tidal interaction between clusters and themselves.
Their interstellar medium (ISM) would be hardly stripped, and their SFA would
be little suppressed. Hence, as long as such galaxies keep up their SFA, the
fraction of blue galaxies in a cluster does not decrease. As a cluster becomes
virialized, however, such galaxies become more accelerated, the ISM available
for SFA is stripped by KHI, and their color evolves redward, which produces the
BO effect.

interaction which shifts the frequencies of two ultrashort laser light pulses
by a non-quantified transfer of energy. As ISRS has no threshold, the laser
pulses may be replaced by the pulses which constitute the ordinary incoherent
light. This replacement has the expected qualitative effect on the time
constants required to observe ISRS: nanosecond collisional time and Raman
period. It has also a qualitative effect, the frequency shifts become
independent on the intensity; thus we use a new name for this avatar of ISRS:
""Incoherent Light Coherent Raman Scattering"" (ILCRS).
  The coherence makes ILCRS very different from the ordinary Raman effect
proposed as an alternative to Doppler effect in the past: ILCRS is a stronger
light-matter interaction, it does not blur the images, nether the spectra; the
beams which receive energy are in the thermal radiation.
  The shifts of the spectra produced either by a Doppler effect, or by ILCRS
are very similar. However ILCRS is subject to a dispersion which perturbs
slightly the spectra. ILCRS is the key of a model of quasars which explains all
observations, without any new matter or physical theory: no fast moving cloud,
no dark matter, no variation of the fine structure constant, no invisible
object.
  The redshifts and the thermal radiation produced by ILCRS should not be
neglected a priori.

7.2+-0.5 Mpc, the value determined by Herrnstein et al. (1999) from purely

supernovae with very large explosion energies ($ \gsim 10^{52} $ ergs). The
hypernova yields compared to those of ordinary core-collapse supernovae show
the following characteristics: 1) Complete Si-burning takes place in more
extended region, so that the mass ratio between the complete and incomplete Si
burning regions is generally larger in hypernovae than normal supernovae. As a
result, higher energy explosions tend to produce larger [(Zn, Co)/Fe], smaller
[(Mn, Cr)/Fe], and larger [Fe/O], which could explain the trend observed in
very metal-poor stars. 2) Si-burning takes place in lower density regions, so
that the effects of $\alpha$-rich freezeout is enhanced. Thus $^{44}$Ca,
$^{48}$Ti, and $^{64}$Zn are produced more abundantly than in normal
supernovae. The large [(Ti, Zn)/Fe] ratios observed in very metal-poor stars
strongly suggest a significant contribution of hypernovae. 3) Oxygen burning
also takes place in more extended regions for the larger explosion energy. Then
a larger amount of Si, S, Ar, and Ca (""Si"") are synthesized, which makes the
""Si""/O ratio larger. The abundance pattern of the starburst galaxy M82 may be

spectrum in the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) representation. Because the
DWT power spectrum is dependent of both the scale and shape (configuration) of
the decomposition modes, it is sensitive to distortion of shape of the field.
On the other hand, the redshift distortion causes a shape distortion of
distributions in real space with respect to redshift space. Therefore, the
shape-dependent DWT power spectrum is useful to detect the effect of redshift
distortion. We first established the mapping between the DWT power spectra in
redshift and real space. The mapping depends on the redshift distortion effects
of (1) bulk velocity, (2) selection function and (3) pairwise peculiar
velocity. We then proposed $\beta$-estimators using the DWT off-diagonal power
spectra. These $\beta$-estimators are model-free even when the non-linear
redshift distortion effect is not negligible. Moreover, these estimators do not
rely on the assumption of whether the pairwise velocity dispersion being
scale-dependent. The tests with N-body simulation samples show that the
proposed $\beta$-estimators can yield reliable measurements of $\beta$ with
about 20% uncertainty for all popular dark matter models. We also develop an
algorithm for reconstruction of the power spectrum in real space from the
redshift distorted power spectrum. The numerical test also shows that the real

essential features of the complex processes taking place on real networks like

many of these systems relations are directed, in the sense that links only act
in one direction (outwards or inwards). We investigate the effect of directed
links on the behaviour of a simple spin-like model evolving on a small-world

measured experimental inhomogeneous charge density in a given compound is
assumed to produce a spatial distribution of local $\rho(r)$. These differences
in the local charge concentration is assumed to yield insulator and metallic
regions, possibly in a stripe morphology. In the metallic region, the
inhomogeneous charge density yields also spatial distributions of
superconducting critical temperatures $T_c(r)$ and zero temperature gap
$\Delta_0(r)$. For a given sample, the measured onset of vanishing gap
temperature is identified as the pseudogap temperature, that is, $T^*$, which
is the maximum of all $T_c(r)$. Below $T^*$, due to the distribution of
$T_c(r)$'s, there are some superconducting regions surrounded by insulator or
metallic medium. The transition to a superconducting state corresponds to the
percolation threshold among the superconducting regions with different
$T_c(r)$'s. To model the charge inhomogeneities we use a double branched
Poisson-Gaussian distribution. To make definite calculations and compare with
the experimental results, we derive phase diagrams for the BSCO, LSCO and YBCO

paper, a multiplicity of plausible scenarios are concurrently developed and
implemented. In conventional simulations of complex systems, there arise from
time to time uncertainties as to which of two or more alternatives are more
likely to be pursued by the system being simulated. Under these conditions the
simulationist makes a judicious choice of one of these alternatives and embeds
this choice in the simulation model. By contrast, in the branching approach,
two or more of such alternatives (or branches) are included in the model and
implemented for concurrent computer solution. The theoretical foundations for
branching simulation as a computational process are in the domains of
alternating Turing machines, molecular computing, and E-machines. Branching
simulations constitute the development of diagrams of scenarios representing
significant, alternative flows of events. Logical means for interpretation and
investigation of the branching simulation and prediction are provided by the
logical theories of possible worlds, which have been formalized by the
construction of logical varieties. Under certain conditions, the branching
approach can considerably enhance the efficiency of computer simulations and
provide more complete insights into the interpretation of predictions based on
simulations. As an example, the concepts developed in this paper have been
applied to a simulation task that plays an important role in radiology - the
noninvasive treatment of brain aneurysms.

semi-local duality agrees with data for moderate values of |t|, but its
normalization is underestimated by about two orders of magnitude. This
indicates that rather high momentum transfers are required for the validity of
PQCD in the hard subprocess \gamma u \to \pi^+ d. In the case of Compton
scattering \gamma p \to \gamma p the analogous discrepancy is about one order
of magnitude. In electroproduction the virtuality of the incoming photon can be
used to directly measure the hardness of the subprocess.

statistical model of hadronisation is performed. The study of particle momentum
spectra requires an extension of the statistical model formalism used to handle
particle multiplicities, which is described in detail starting from a
microcanonical treatment of single hadronising clusters. Also, a new treatment
of extra strangeness suppression is presented which is based on the enforcement
of fixed numbers of ssbar pairs in the primary hadrons. The considered
centre-of-mass energies range from ~ 10 to 30 GeV in hadronic collisions
(pion-p, pp and Kp) and from ~ 15 to 35 GeV in e+e- collisions. The effect of
the decay chain following hadron generation is accurately and exhaustively
taken into account by a newly proposed numerical method. The exact p_T
conservation at low energy and the increasing hard parton emission at high
energy bound the validity of the presently taken approach within a limited
centre-of-mass energy range. However, within this region, a clear consistency
is found between the temperature parameter extracted from the present analysis
and that obtained from fits to average hadron multiplicities in the same
collision systems. This finding indicates that in the hadronisation process the
production of different particle species and their momentum spectra are two
closely related phenomena governed by one parameter.

aspect of our method is the proper representation of the quasi-particle
continuum wavefunctions, which are considered for energies up to 60 MeV. This
stage is essential for a proper description of nuclei near the drip lines, due
to the strong coupling between weakly bound states and the particle continuum
for such nuclei. High accuracy is achieved by representing the operators and
wavefunctions using the technique of basis-splines. Calculations for Sn
isotopes are presented to demonstrate the reliability of the method.

analogy to barotropic Friedmann-Robertson-Lemaitre cosmology where the
expansion of the universe can be also shown to obey a Riccati equation. A
second application in classical mechanics, where again the Riccati equation
appears naturally, are problems involving quadratic friction. We use methods
reminiscent to nonrelativistic supersymmetry to generalize and solve such

define a Hamming distance in conformational space: the distance between two
different molecular conformations is the number of different bits in their
sequences. Each bit in the sequence arises from a partition of conformational
space in two halves. Thus, the information encoded in the binary sequences is
also used to characterize the regions of conformational space visited by the
system. We apply this distance and their associated geometric structures, to
the clustering and analysis of conformations sampled during a 4 ns molecular
dynamics simulation of the HIV-1 integrase catalytic core. The cluster analysis
of the simulation shows a division of the trajectory into two segments of 2.6
and 1.4 ns length, which are qualitatively different: the data points to the
fact that equilibration is only reached at the end of the first segment. Some
length of the paper is devoted to compare the Hamming distance to the r.m.s.
deviation measure. The analysis of the cases studied so far, shows that under
the same conditions the two measures behave quite differently, and that the
Hamming distance appears to be more robust than the r.m.s. deviation.

implemented, as much as it is valid in principle--that is, if certain
hamiltonian and its ground state can be physically constructed according to the
proposal--quantum computability would surpass classical computability as
delimited by the Church-Turing thesis. It is thus argued that computability,
and with it the limits of Mathematics, ought to be determined not solely by
Mathematics itself but also by Physical Principles.

loophole for local realism, known as the memory loophole. We show that the

is van de Geer's (2000) supermartingale version of the classical Bernstein
(1924) inequality guaranteeing, at the root n scale, a
not-heavier-than-Gaussian tail of the distribution of a sum of bounded
supermartingale differences. The results are used to specify a protocol for a

Regoli, 2000a,b, 2001; Accardi, Imafuku and Regoli, 2002) has claimed to have
produced a suite of computer programmes, to be run on a network of computers,
which will simulate a violation of Bell's inequalites. At a sample size of
thirty thousand, both error probabilities are guaranteed smaller than one in a
million, provided we adhere to the sequential randomized design. The results
also show that Hess and Philipp's (2001a,b) recent claims are mistaken that
Bell's theorem fails because of time phenomena supposedly neglected by Bell.

probabilities to define the measure of entanglement. Our measure turns out to
be proportional to the so-called 2-entropy and therefore satisfies the
