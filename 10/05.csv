The wide-separation (\theta > 4'') lensing rate is a particularly sensitive

J0421+560, two weeks after the peak of its short outburst in 1998 April. The
optical counterpart is a supergiant B[e] star emitting a two-component wind.
The cool wind (the source of narrow emission lines of neutral and ionized
metals) has a velocity of 32 km/s and a temperature near 8000 K. Dense and
roughly spherical, it fills the space around the sgB[e] star, and, based on the
size of an infrared-emitting dust shell around the system, extends to a radius
between 13 - 50 AU. It carries away mass at a high rate, Mdot > 10^(-6) solar
masses per year. The hot wind has a velocity in excess of 2500 km/s and a
temperature of 1.7 +/-0.3 x 10^4 K. From UV spectra of CI Cam obtained in 2000
March with Hubble Space Telescope, we derive a differential extinction E(B-V) =
0.85 +/- 0.05. We derive a distance to CI Cam > 5 kpc. Based on this revised
distance, the X-ray luminosity at the peak of the outburst was L(2-25 keV) >
3.0 x 10^38 erg/s, making CI Cam one of the most luminous X-ray transients. The
ratio of quiescent to peak luminosity in the 2 - 25 keV band is < 1.7 x
10^(-6). The compact star in CI Cam is immersed in the dense circumstellar wind
from the sgB[e] star and burrows through the wind producing little X-ray
emission except for rare transient outbursts. This picture (a compact star
traveling in a wide orbit through the dense circumstellar envelope of a sgB[e]
star, occasionally producing transient X-ray outbursts) makes CI Cam unique
among the known X-ray binaries. Strong circumstantial evidence suggests that
the compact object is a black hole, not a neutron star. We speculate that the
X-ray outburst was short because the accretion disk around the compact star is
fed from a stellar wind and is smaller than disks fed by Roche-lobe overflow.

increases from ~4 d/mag to ~12 d/mag over the first ~15 d of the ~25 d

caused by the sudden accretion of ~10^{24} g of gas onto the white dwarf, and
the deviation from exponentiality in the decay light curve is expected
qualitatively during a ``viscous decay'' in which the dominant mode of
depletion of the gas stored in the accretion disk is accretion onto the central
object. In other words, as the mass of the accretion disk decreases, the
viscous time scale increases. We show that the data are also quantitatively

sources and redshifts for 11, of which 8 are confirmed cluster members. 4 of
these 8 confirmed cluster sources are associated with close galaxy pairs (10-25
kpc projected offset) of similar magnitude, implying that the radio source may
be triggered by an interaction. However, although MS1054-03 has a very high
fraction (17%) of on-going mergers (separations <~ 10 kpc), no radio emission
is detected towards any of these merger events, setting a mean upper limit of
10 Msun/yr for any star formation associated with these mergers. This supports
a hypothesis that low luminosity radio sources may be onset by initial weak
interactions rather than direct mergers. The host galaxies of the other four
confirmed cluster radio sources are all isolated, and show a range of
morphologies from early-type to Sc. A comparison between the emission line and
radio luminosities suggests that two of these four radio sources are
low-luminosity AGN, whilst for at least one of the other two the radio emission
is associated with on-going star formation. All of the radio sources associated
with the galaxy pairs appear more likely AGN than starburst origin. The overall

higher than at these flux density levels in the field (40-50%).

time evolution shows the quasi-periodic recurrence of spike-shape variations
typically for a few orbits which correspond to the rapid amplification of the
magnetic field by the nonlinear growth of a two-channel solution followed by
the decay through magnetic reconnections. The increase rate of the total energy
in the shearing box system is analytically related to the volume-averaged
torque in the system. We find that at the saturated state this energy gain of
the system is balanced with the increase of the thermal energy mostly due to
the joule heating. The spike-shape time evolution is a general feature of the
nonlinear evolution of the MRI in the disks threaded by vertical fields and can
be seen if the effective magnetic Reynolds number is larger than about unity.

First, we use narrow band imaging to select candidate galaxies which show
excess Lyman alpha emission at redshifts similar to the central radio galaxy.
Then, we use multi object spectroscopy to confirm the redshifts of these

search for distant radio-loud quasars. The sample has been used to investigate
possible relations between optical and radio properties of flat spectrum radio
sources. From the 915 sources in the sample, 756 have an optical APM
identification at a red (e) and/or blue (o) plate,resulting in an
identification fraction of 83% with a completeness and reliability of 98% and
99% respectively. About 20% are optically identified with extended APM objects
on the red plates, e.g. galaxies. However the distinction between galaxies and
quasars can not be done properly near the magnitude limit of the POSS-I plates.
The identification fraction appears to decrease from >90% for sources with a 5
GHz flux density of >1 Jy, to <80% for sources at 0.2 Jy. The identification
fraction, in particular that for unresolved quasars, is found to be lower for
sources with steeper radio spectra. In agreement with previous studies, we find
that the quasars at low radio flux density levels also tend to have fainter
optical magnitudes, although there is a large spread. In addition, objects with
a steep radio-to-optical spectral index are found to be mainly highly polarised
quasars, supporting the idea that in these objects the polarised synchrotron
component is more prominent. It is shown that the large spread in
radio-to-optical spectral index is possibly caused by source to source
variations in the Doppler boosting of the synchrotron component [Abridged].

galaxy NGC 526A in the band 0.1-150 keV. The high energy instrument onboard,
PDS, has succeeded in measuring for the first time the spectrum of this source
in the 13-150 keV range. The combined analysis of all Narrow Field Instruments
provides a power law spectral index of ~ 1.6 and confirms the flat spectral
nature of this source. Although NGC 526A varies strongly in the 2-10 keV over
period of months/years, its spectral shape remains constant over these
timescales. An Fe K-alpha line, characterized by a complex structure, has been
detected in the 6-7 keV range. The line, which has an equivalent width of 120
eV, is not compatible with being produced in an absorbing torus with N_H ~
10^22 cm^-2, but most likely originates by reflection in an accretion disk
viewed at an intermediate inclination angle of ~ 42 deg. The reflection
component is however small (R < 0.7) and so it is not sufficient to steepen the
spectrum to photon index values more typical of AGNs. Instead, we find that the
data are more consistent with a flat power law spectrum cut-off at around 100
keV plus a small reflection component which could explain the observed iron
line. Thus NGC 526A is the only bona-fide Seyfert 2 galaxy which maintains a
""flat spectrum"" even when broad band data are considered: in this sense its
properties, with respect to the general class of Seyfert 2's, are analogous to
those of NGC 4151 with respect to the vast majority of Seyfert 1's.

particle-reinforced rubbers at isothermal loading with finite strains. A filled
rubber is thought of as a composite medium where inclusions with high and low
concentrations of junctions between chains are randomly distributed in a host
matrix. The inclusions with high concentration of junctions are associated with
regions of suppressed mobility of chains that surround isolated clusters of
filler and its secondary network. The regions with low concentration of
junctions arise during the mixing process due to the inhomogeneity in spatial
distribution of a cross-linker. The viscoelastic response of elastomers is
ascribed to the thermally activated processes of breakage and reformation of
strands in the domains with low concentration of junctions. Stress-strain
relations for particle-reinforced rubbers are developed by using the laws of
thermodynamics. Adjustable parameters in the constitutive equations are found
by fitting experimental data in tensile relaxation tests for several grades of

relaxation rate is noticeably affected by strains. Unlike glassy polymers,
where the growth of longitudinal strain results in an increase in the rate of
relaxation, the growth of the elongation ratio for natural rubber (unfilled or

explained by partial crystallization of chains in the regions with low

two regularisations of the projector onto the kernel of the Hamiltonian

  In this lecture we focus on simulation in real time and the problems which
arise when invariants of the motion are monitored in a simulation.
  Ad hoc discretisations invariably introduce drift in numerically computed
invariants, due not only to numerical accuracy (which can be negligible), but
with the fact that the discretisation may not necessarily imply conservation.
We discuss an approach developed which gives principles for the discretisation
of such systems and for the construction of exact discrete invariants of the

  Given a permutation w in S_n, we consider a determinantal ideal I_w whose
generators are certain minors in the generic n x n matrix (filled with
independent variables). Using `multidegrees' as simple algebraic substitutes
for torus-equivariant cohomology classes on vector spaces, our main theorems
describe, for each ideal I_w:
  - variously graded multidegrees and Hilbert series in terms of ordinary and
double Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials;
  - a Gr\""obner basis consisting of minors in the generic n x n matrix;

combinatorial diagrams associated to permutations in S_n; and
  - a procedure inductive on weak Bruhat order for listing the facets of this
complex, thereby generating the coefficients of Schubert polynomials by a
positive recursion on combinatorial diagrams.
  We show that the initial ideal is Cohen-Macaulay, by identifying the
Stanley-Reisner complex as a special kind of ``subword complex in S_n'', which
we define generally for arbitrary Coxeter groups, and prove to be shellable by
giving an explicit vertex decomposition. We also prove geometrically a general

form Cooper pairs with total spin zero. We solve the gap equation for the
color-superconducting gap parameter to subleading order in the QCD coupling
constant $g$ at zero temperature. At this order in $g$, there is also a
previously neglected contribution from the real part of the quark self-energy
to the gap equation. Including this contribution leads to a reduction of the
color-superconducting gap parameter $\f_0$ by a factor $b_0'=\exp \big[ -(\p
^2+4)/8 \big]\simeq 0.177$. On the other hand, the BCS relation $T_c\simeq
0.57\f_0$ between $\f_0$ and the transition temperature $T_c$ is shown to
remain valid after taking into account corrections from the quark self-energy.
The resulting value for $T_c$ confirms a result obtained previously with a
different method.

the Hamiltonian level where a dc circular spontaneous flow exists in absence of

proper relaxation. The flow causes a spontaneous unidirectional transfer of
heat from one bath to another one, even against temperature step. This is what
is explicitly forbidden by the Clausius form of the Second law of
thermodynamics. The unidirectionality of the flow is caused by that of
spontaneous processes known to bear this property since their introduction by
Einstein. The model slightly improves the previous one (\v{C}\'{a}pek & Sheehan
2002), describes a realistic plasma system for which experimental results
violating the second law were announced, and the result obtained fully supports
the experimental conclusions (Sheehan 1995). Analytical proof of the violation
is supported by numerical results. All mathematical details are exposed, two
fully independent types of mathematical arguments behind starting equations are

presented, based on the subdynamical kinetic equation (SKE) for an open quantum
system. The eigenvectors of the kinetic equation are shown to remain invariant
before and after interaction with the environment. However, the eigenvalues in
the projected subspace exhibit a type of phase shift to the evolutionary
states. This phase shift does not destroy the decoherence-free (DF) property of
the subspace because the associated fidelity is 1. This permits a universal
formalism to be presented - the eigenprojectors of the free part of the
Hamiltonian for the system and bath may be used to construct a DF projected
subspace based on the SKE. To eliminate possible phase or unitary errors
induced by the change in the eigenvalues, a cancellation technique is proposed,
using the adjustment of the coupling time, and applied to a two qubit computing
system. A general criteria for constructing a DF projected subspace from the
SKE is discussed. Finally, a proposal for using triangulation to realize a
decoherence-free subsystem based on SKE is presented. The concrete formulation
for a two-qubit model is given exactly. Our approach is novel and general, and
appears applicable to any type of decoherence. Key Words: Quantum Computing,
