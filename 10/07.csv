identify a representative PMS population throughout the interior of the
molecular ring. The spatial distribution of this population shows a
concentration of PMS stars around lambda Ori and in front of the B35 dark
cloud. Few PMS stars are found outside these pockets of high stellar density,
suggesting that star formation was concentrated in an elongated cloud extending
from B35 through lambda Ori to the B30 cloud. We find a lower limit for the
global stellar mass of about 500 Mo. We find that the global ratio of low- to
high-mass stars is similar to that predicted by the field initial mass
function, but this ratio varies strongly as a function of position in the
star-forming region. Locally, the star-formation process does not produce a
universal initial mass function. We construct a history of the star-forming
complex. This history incorporates a recent supernova to explain the
distribution of stars and gas today.

the folding of small protein sequences and its kinetic counterpart appears to

sensitive to target conformation. The extent to which stability, as measured by
the energy of a sequence in the target, is an essential requirement and affects

The folding dynamics of sequences whose design stage was restricted to a
certain fraction of randomly selected amino acids shows that while some degree
of stability is a necessary and sufficient condition for successful folding,
designing sequences that provide the lowest energy in the target seems to be a
superfluous constraint. By studying the dynamics of under annealed but

at finite temperatures time-averaged measurement of the current leads to a
fringe visibility which is reduced partly by dephasing of the electrons and
partly by a thermal smearing effect. The balance between thermal smearing and
dephasing predicted by a calculation depends very strongly on the choice of
cantilever basis states used. The interaction between the cantilever and its

constraints on the inflaton potential from the CMB anisotropy can be relaxed.
In particular, the scale of the inflation may be significantly lowered. In
addition, with the cosmological moduli fields, correlated mixture of adiabatic
and isocurvature fluctuations may be generated, which results in enhanced CMB
angular power spectrum at higher multipoles relative to that of lower ones.
Such an enhancement can be an evidence of the cosmological moduli fields, and

study a new basis in the algebra of symmetric functions. The elements of this
basis are called the Frobenius-Schur functions (FS-functions, for short).
  Our main motivation for studying the FS-functions is the fact that they enter
a formula expressing the combinatorial dimension of a skew Young diagram in
terms of the Frobenius coordinates. This formula plays a key role in the
asymptotic character theory of the symmetric groups. The FS-functions are
inhomogeneous, and their top homogeneous components coincide with the
conventional Schur functions. The FS-functions are best described in the super
realization of the algebra of symmetric functions. As supersymmetric functions,
the FS-functions can be characterized as a solution to an interpolation
problem.
  Our main result is a simple determinantal formula for the transition
coefficients between the FS-functions and the Schur functions. We also
establish the FS analogs for a number of basic facts concerning the Schur
functions: Jacobi-Trudi formula together with its dual form; combinatorial
formula (expression in terms of tableaux); Giambelli formula and the
Sergeev-Pragacz formula.
