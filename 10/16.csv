color, and velocity dispersion V, are correlated with one another. Measurement
biases are understood with mock catalogs which reproduce all of the observed

luminosities, sizes and velocity dispersions in our sample are all
approximately Gaussian. In the r* band L ~ V^3.91, L ~ R^1.58, R ~ I^(-0.75),
and the Fundamental Plane relation is R ~ V^(1.49) I^(-0.75). These relations
are approximately the same in the g*, i* and z* bands. At fixed luminosity, the
mass-to-light ratio scales as M/L ~ L^0.14. The g*-r* color scales as V^0.25.
Color also correlates with magnitude and size, but these correlations are
entirely due to the L-V and R-V relations. Chemical evolution and star
formation histories are investigated using co-added spectra of similar objects
in our sample. Chemical abundances correlate primarily with velocity
dispersion. At fixed V, the higher redshift population is bluer, is weaker in
Mg2, and is stronger in Hbeta than the population nearby. In addition, the
population at higher redshifts is slightly more luminous. These differences are
consistent with that of a passively evolving population which formed the bulk
of its stars about 9 Gyrs ago. The Fundamental Plane suggests that galaxies in
dense regions are slightly different from those in less dense regions, but the
co-added spectra and color--magnitude relations show no statistically
significant dependence on environment.

homogeneous set of abundance measurements for many elements including Si, Cr,
Ni, Zn, Fe, Al, S, Co, O, and Ar from 38 damped Lya systems with z > 1.5. With
little exception, these damped Llya systems exhibit very similar relative
abundances. There is no significant correlation in X/Fe with [Fe/H] metallicity
and the dispersion in X/Fe is small at all metallicity.
  We search the database for trends indicative of dust depletion and in a few
cases find strong evidence. Specifically, we identify a correlation between
[Si/Ti] and [Zn/Fe] which is unambiguous evidence for depletion.
  We present a discussion on the nucleosynthetic history of the damped Lya
systems by focusing on abundance patterns which are minimally affected by dust
depletion. We find [Si/Fe] -> +0.25 dex as [Zn/Fe] -> 0 and that the [Si/Fe]
values exhibit a plateau of ~+0.3 dex at [Si/H] < -1.5 dex. Together these
trends indicate significant alpha-enrichment in the damped Lya systems at low
metallicity, an interpretation further supported by the observed O/Fe, S/Fe and
Ar/Fe ratios. We also discuss Fe-peak nucleosynthesis and the odd-even effect.
  To assess the impact of dust obscuration, we present estimates of the
dust-to-gas ratios for the damped Lya sightlines and crudely calculate dust
extinction corrections. The distribution of extinction corrections suggests the
effects of dust obscuration are minimal and that the population of 'missing'
damped systems has physical characteristics similar to the observed sample.

plasmas is given. Unlike many astrophysical systems, the laboratory pinch
plasmas are driven magnetically. When the system is overdriven, the resultant
instabilities cause magnetic and flow fields to fluctuate, and their
correlation induces electromotive forces along the mean magnetic field. This
$\alpha$-effect drives mean parallel electric current, which, in turn, modifies
the initial background mean magnetic structure towards the stable regime. This
drive-and-relax cycle, or the so-called self-organization process, happens in
magnetized plasmas in a time scale much shorter than resistive diffusion time,
thus it is a fast and unquenched dynamo process. The observed $\alpha$-effect
redistributes magnetic helicity (a measure of twistedness and knottedness of
magnetic field lines) but conserves its total value. It can be shown that fast
and unquenched dynamos are natural consequences of a driven system where
fluctuations are statistically either not stationary in time or not homogeneous
in space, or both. Implications to astrophysical phenomena will be discussed.

be derived naturally in the CDM paradigm. They actually proceed to produce a
more limited result: Every galaxy should have a transition radius, $r_t$, below
which baryons dominate, and above which dark matter (DM) takes over; the
acceleration at $r_t$ is nearly the same for all galaxies; and due to a
coincidences this is of order $a_0\sim cH_0$. This follows from their tacit,
intermediate result, whereby CDM halos of galaxies have a very nearly universal
acceleration profile $a(r)\approx v^2(r)/r\approx A\hat a(r/\ell)$, where A is
universal, and only the scale $\ell$ varies from halo to halo. (This remains so
when baryons are added because they assume a universal baryon-collapse factor.)
The KT scenario is phenomenologically wrong--observed galaxies are simply not
like that. For example, it precludes altogether the existence of LSB galaxies,
in which the acceleration is everywhere smaller than $a_0$. The
phenomenologically sound outcome--i.e., the role of $a_0$ as a transition
acceleration in high-surface-brightness galaxies--pertains to only a small part
of the statement of MOND. There are several other, independent roles that
$a_0\sim cH_0$ plays in MOND phenomenology, and other predictions of MOND, not
related to the value of $a_0$, that are not explainable in the KT scenario.
  The results of KT also disagree with those of CDM simulations, which, as they
now stand, do not reproduce any aspect of MOND phenomenology.

distance (0<R<18kpc), which enables us to study excitation and metallicity
variations over large Galactic scales. We detect a steep rise in the

The extra galactic sources in our sample show low gas density, low metallicity
and high excitation. We find a good correlation between the neon and the argon
excitation ratios in our sample. The observed correlation is well-reproduced by
theoretical nebular models which incorporate new generation wind-driven NLTE
model stellar atmospheres for the photoionizing stars. In particular, the NLTE
atmospheres can account for the production of [NeIII] emission in the HII
regions. We conclude that the increase in nebular excitation with
galactocentric radius is due to an increase in stellar effective temperature
(as opposed to a hardening of the stellar SEDs due to the metallicity
gradient). The good fit between observations and our models support the
conclusion of Thornley et al. (2000), that the low neon ratios observed in
extra-galactic sources are due to global aging effects.

constrained by the apparent magnitude (line-of-sight) distributions of clump
giant stars in certain bulge fields. An important new feature is the inclusion
of a spiral arm model in the disk. Spiral arms make the model appear broader on
the sky, thus our bar is more elongated than in previous eight-fold symmetric
models. They also lead to a smoother disk model interior to the Sun. The bar
length is approx. 3.5kpc and its axis ratios are 1:(0.3-0.4):0.3, independent
of whether the spiral arm model is 4-armed or 2-armed. The larger elongation in
the plane makes it possible to reproduce the observed clump giant distributions
as well. For the bar angle we estimate 15^o <= phi <= 30^o, with the best
models obtained for 20^o <= phi <= 25^o. We use our reference model to predict
a microlensing optical depth map towards the bulge, normalising its mass by the
observed terminal velocity curve. For clump giant sources at (l,b)=(3.9,-3.8)
we find tau_{-6}:=tau/10^{-6}=1.27, within 1.8*sigma of the new MACHO
measurement given by Popowski et al. The value for all sources at
(l,b)=(2.68,-3.35) is tau_{-6}=1.1, still >3*sigma away from the published
MACHO DIA value. The dispersion of these tau_{-6} values within our models is
10%. Because the distribution of sources is well-fit by the NIR model,
increasing the predicted optical depths by >20% will be difficult. Thus the
high value of the measured clump giant optical depth argues for a near-maximal
disk in the Milky Way. (abridged)

constant emission from the center out to a few arcsec radius followed by a
first power law intensity distribution which steepens further outside into a

tight constrains on the density indices is very difficult and subject to many
possible errors. The local densities we derive from CS calculations are higher

was realized with collisionless particles, the gas was represented by SPH
particles. Since we did not include star formation we focused on the gas
dynamics and its influence on the structure of merger remnants. We find that
equal-mass mergers are in general more effective in driving gas to the center.
Around 50% of the gas resides in the central regions after the merger is
complete. The gas in unequal-mass mergers keeps a large amount of its initial
angular momentum and settles in a large scale disk while only 20% -30% of the
gas is driven to the center. This general result is almost independent of the
merger geometry. The gas in the outer regions accumulates in dense knots within
tidal tails which could lead to the formation of open clusters or dwarf
satellites. Later on, the gas knots loose angular momentum by dynamical
friction and successively sink to the center of the remnant thereby increasing
the total gas content of the disk. Due to the influence of the gas the
simulated merger remnant becomes more oblate than its pure stellar counterpart.
The shape of the stellar LOSVD changes and the third-order Gauss-Hermite
coefficient $h_3$ is in good agreement with observations.

equivalent noise temperature of a two terminal network. Quite interestingly,
this equivalent noise temperature of an ideal pn diode equals the actual
temperatue of the diode. Furthermore, if this newly defined equivalent noise
temperature can be estimated for a given network by physical arguments, than
the noise of the network can be calculated provided its current voltage
dependence is known. As an example, the suppression of shot noise due to
recombination in the space charge region of a pn diode is estimated using this
procedure.

of states (TDOS) are studied near the integer quantum Hall transitions (IQHT).
Taking into account the dynamical screening of the interactions in the critical
conducting state, we show that the behavior of the TDOS is significantly
altered from its noninteracting counterpart. For Coulomb interaction, we
demonstrate that the TDOS vanishes linearly at the Fermi level according to a
quantum Coulomb gap form with a nonuniversal slope. For short-range
interactions, the TDOS is found to follow a power-law with an exponent
proportional to the interaction strength. Since short-range interactions are
known to be irrelevant perturbations at the non-interacting critical point, we
predict that upon scaling, the power-law is smeared, leading to a finite zero
bias TDOS. However, the approach to the zero-bias value is described by a
power-law with a universal exponent determined by the scaling dimension of
short-range interactions. We also consider the case of quasi-1D samples with
edges and find that the TDOS becomes dependent of the Hall conductance due to
an altered boundary condition for diffusion. For short-range interactions, the
TDOS of a quasi-1D strip is linear near the Fermi level with a slope inversely
proportional to the resistivity in the perturbative limit. These results are in
qualitative agreement with the bulk tunneling experiments. We discuss recent
developments in understanding the role played by electron-electron interactions
at the IQHT and the implications of these results on dynamical scaling of the
transition width. We argue that for the long-range Coulomb interaction, the
existence of the quantum Coulomb gap in the quantum critical regime of the
transition gives rise to the observed dynamical exponent z=1.

find a different parity effect parameter to critical temperature ratio (=~ 4

been introduced an extra parameter, the effective temperature which generalizes
the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) to off-equilibrium systems and
supposedly describes thermal fluctuations around the aging state. In particular
we analyze two coupled systems of harmonic oscillators with Monte Carlo
dynamics. We study in detail two types of dynamics: sequential dynamics, where
the coupling between the subsystems comes only from the Hamiltonian; and
parallel dynamics where there is another source of coupling: the dynamics. We
show how in the first case the effective temperatures of the two interacting
subsystems are different asymptotically due to the smallness of the thermal
conductivity in the aging regime. This explains why, in structural glasses,
different interacting degrees of freedom can stay at different effective
temperatures, and never thermalize.

at finite energy density. We concentrate on two specific models. The first is
the massive Wess-Zumino model which we study in a selfconsistent one-loop
approximation. We find that for energy densities above a certain threshold, the
fields are driven dynamically to a point in field space at which the fermionic
component of the superfield is massless. The state, however is found to be
unstable, indicating a breakdown of the one-loop approximation. To investigate
further, we consider an O(N) massive chiral model which is solved exactly in
the large $N$ limit. For sufficiently high energy densities, we find that for
late times the fields reach a nonperturbative minimum of the effective
potential degenerate with the perturbative minimum. This minimum is a true
attractor for O(N) invariant states at high energy densities, and this provides
a mechanism for determining which of the otherwise degenerate vacua is chosen
by the dynamics. The final state for large energy density is a cloud of
massless particles (both bosons and fermions) around this new nonperturbative
supersymmetric minimum. By introducing boson masses which softly break the
supersymmetry, we demonstrate a see-saw mechanism for generating small fermion
masses. We discuss some of the cosmological implications of our results.

we lift various structures from complex vector spaces to modular tensor
categories. The central ingredient is a special Frobenius algebra object A in
the modular category that encodes the Moore-Seiberg data of the underlying
chiral CFT. Just like for lattice TFTs, this algebra is itself not an
observable quantity. Rather, Morita equivalent algebras give rise to equivalent
theories. Morita equivalence also allows for a simple understanding of
T-duality.
  We present a construction of correlators, based on a triangulation of the
world sheet, that generalizes the one in lattice TFTs. These correlators are
modular invariant and satisfy factorization rules. The construction works for
arbitrary orientable world sheets, in particular for surfaces with boundary.
Boundary conditions correspond to representations of the algebra A. The
partition functions on the torus and on the annulus provide modular invariants
and NIM-reps of the fusion rules, respectively.

momentum-dependent trigonometric factors in interaction vertices,
characteristic of noncommutative geometry, are marginal under RG
transformations, and their marginality is preserved at one loop. A negative
$\Theta$-dependent anomalous dimension is discovered as a novel effect of the
UV-IR mixing. We also found a noncommutative Wilson-Fisher (NCWF) fixed point
in less than four dimensions. At large noncommutativity, a momentum space
instability is induced by quantum fluctuations, and a consequential first-order
phase transition is identified together with a Lifshitz point in the phase
diagram. In the vicinity of the Lifshitz point, we introduce two critical
exponents $\nu_m$ and $\beta_k$, whose values are determined to be 1/4 and 1/2,

geometric computer vision is essentially limited to static configurations of
points and lines in $P^3$ . By using some well known material from algebraic
geometry, we open new branches to computational vision. We introduce algebraic
curves embedded in $P^3$ as the building blocks from which the tensor of a
couple of cameras (projections) can be computed. In the process we address
dimensional issues and as a result establish the minimal number of algebraic
curves required for the tensor variety to be discrete as a function of their
degree and genus. We then establish new results on the reconstruction of an
algebraic curves in $P^3$ from multiple projections on projective planes
embedded in $P^3$ . We address three different presentations of the curve: (i)
definition by a set of equations, for which we show that for a generic
configuration, two projections of a curve of degree d defines a curve in $P^3$
with two irreducible components, one of degree d and the other of degree $d(d -
1)$, (ii) the dual presentation in the dual space $P^{3*}$, for which we derive
a lower bound for the number of projections necessary for linear reconstruction
as a function of the degree and the genus, and (iii) the presentation as an
hypersurface of $P^5$, defined by the set of lines in $P^3$ meeting the curve,
for which we also derive lower bounds for the number of projections necessary
for linear reconstruction as a function of the degree (of the curve). Moreover
we show that the latter representation yields a new and efficient algorithm for
dealing with mixed configurations of static and moving points in $P^3$.

kinetics equations, namely, the method of intrinsic low-dimensional manifolds
(ILDMs) due to Maas and Pope and an iterative method due to Fraser and further
developed by Roussel and Fraser. Both methods exploit the separation of fast
and slow reaction time scales to find low-dimensional manifolds in the space of
species concentrations where the long-term dynamics are played out. The
analysis is carried out in the context of systems of ordinary differential
equations with multiple time scales and geometric singular perturbation theory.
A small parameter $\eps$ measures the separation of time scales. The underlying
assumptions are that the system of equations has an asymptotically stable slow
manifold $\mathcal{M}_0$ in the limit as $\eps \downarrow 0$ and that there
exists a slow manifold $\mathcal{M}_\eps$ for all sufficiently small positive
$\eps$, which is asymptotically close to $\mathcal{M}_0$.
  It is shown that the ILDM method yields a low-dimensional manifold whose
asymptotic expansion agrees with the asymptotic expansion of $\mathcal{M}_\eps$
up to and including terms of $\mathcal{O} (\eps)$. The error at $\mathcal{O}
(\eps^2)$ is proportional to the local curvature of $\mathcal{M}_0$. The
iterative method generates, term by term, the asymptotic expansion of the slow
manifold $\mathcal{M}_\eps$. The analytical results are illustrated in two
examples.

symmetry of the initial distribution, has been demonstrated numerically for the
first time. Behavior of the maximum of vorticity near the point of collapse
closely follows the dependence 1/(t0-t), where t0 is the time of collapse. This
agrees with the interpretation of collapse in an ideal incompressible fluid as
of the process of vortex lines breaking.

exact way divergent integrals and limits that appear in the basic equations of
classical electrodynamics with point charges. In this way all divergences are
at once removed without affecting the locality and the relativistic covariance
of the theory, and with no need for mass renormalization. The procedure is
first used to obtain a finite expression for the electromagnetic
energy-momentum of the system. We show that the relativistic Lorentz-Dirac
equation can be deduced from the conservation of this electromagnetic
energy-momentum plus the usual mechanical term. Then we derive a finite
lagrangian, which depends on the particle variables and on the actual
electromagnetic potentials at a given time. From this lagrangian the equations
of motion of both particles and fields can be derived via Hamilton's
variational principle. The hamiltonian formulation of the theory can be
obtained in a straightforward way. This leads to an interesting comparison
between the resulting divergence-free expression of the hamiltonian functional
and the standard renormalization rules for perturbative quantum
electrodynamics.

Mermin-Ardehali-Belinskii-Klyshko inequalities may not always be optimal for
refutation of local realistic description.

minimum number of qubits necessary for the solution of the Schroedinger

results it appears that it is possible to realize a useful quantum simulator
with a register of only 10-15 qbits. The intrinsic sensitivity to some errors
appears to be moderate without the need of error correcting methods. At present
there is at least some indication that the amplitude errors are more dangerous
than phase and decoherence errors. So corrections limited to amplitude errors
may be very useful.
