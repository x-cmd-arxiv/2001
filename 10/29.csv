technique to objects in the 3C 324 field, and identified 35 objects as
plausible cluster members. We have found that red and luminous members are
concentrated in a small region enclosed by a circle of 40"" radius (0.33 Mpc at
z=1.2 for \Omega_0=0.3, \lambda_0=0.7, H_0=70km/s/Mpc cosmology) from the 3C

with the local clusters. We constructed a K'-band luminosity function of the
cluster members and fit a Schechter function, and found the characteristic
magnitude to be K*_{AB}=20.2+-0.6. This value is consistent with the
extrapolation of the pure passive evolution seen for z<1 clusters. We have
identified eight bright galaxies which form a red color-magnitude sequence. The
slope of the sequence is consistent with the passive evolution model down to
K'_{AB}<22; we also found that there is no clear age variation in these bright
red galaxies. However, seven out of these eight galaxies exhibit a significant
excess in the rest UV light with respect to the passive evolution model. This
may suggest that the massive early-type galaxies in this high-redshift cluster
are still forming stars to some extent. We have confirmed a truncation of the
color-magnitude sequence at K'_{AB}\sim22; faint passively-evolving galaxies

Using the REFLEX Cluster Survey, the measurement of the statistics of the

results clearly favour a low density Universe. Clusters constitute, in
addition, well defined astrophysical laboratory environments in which some very
interesting large-scale phenomena can be studied. As an illustration we show
some spectacular new XMM X-ray spectroscopic results on the thermal structure
of cooling flows and the interaction effects of AGN with this hot intracluster
medium. The X-ray observations with XMM-Newton show a lack of spectral evidence
for large amounts of cooling and condensing gas in the centers of galaxy
clusters believed to harbour strong cooling flows. To explain these findings we
consider the heating of the core regions of clusters by jets from a central
AGN. We find that the power output the AGN jets is well sufficient. The
requirements such a heating model has to fulfill are explored and we find a
very promising scenario of self-regulated Bondi accretion of the central black

of a marked jump in the temperature at the mean density, T_0, of 60 per cent
around a redshift z=3.3, which we attribute to reionization of HeliumII. The
jump can be seen in all three of our spectra that straddle redshift 3.3, at a
significance of 99 per cent. Below z=3.1, our results are consistent with a
smooth cooling down of the universe, as expected when adiabatic expansion
dominates over photo-heating by a UV-background from QSOs and galaxies. We find
no evidence of thermal fluctuations on scales greater than 5000 km/s larger
than 50 per cent, which could be detected by our method, suggesting that the

demonstrate that the mean wavelet amplitude scales inversely with T_0 and
calibrate the relation with hydrodynamical simulations. We find T_0= 12000K at

that the dark polar cap seen in Doppler images of this star is caused by the
presence of a unipolar field, we have shown that the observed differential
rotation will shear this field to produce the observed high-latitude band of
unidirectional azimuthal field. By cross-correlating the evolved fields each
day with the initial field we have followed the decay with time of the
cross-correlation function. Over 30 days it decays by only 10 percent. This
contrasts with the results of Barnes et al (1998), who show that on this
timescale the spot distribution of He699 is uncorrelated. We propose that this

consequences for the shape and central energy of the observed emission lines:
the lines acquire a very broad scattering wing on the low-energy side and a
characteristic second peak one Compton wavelength away from the initial energy,
due to the once- and twice-scattered photons. We suggest that this explains the
large width of the observed lines. Furthermore, the downscattering lowers the
central line energy (by up to 1 keV in the source rest frame, before the lines
become unrecognizable), so that the observed line energies can become
consistent with originating from cobalt and nickel, as expected in few-day-old
supernova ejecta.

to a minimum. In such a way, we derive new explicit symplectic Forest-Ruth- and
Suzuki-like integrators and present them in time-reversible velocity and
position forms. It is proven that these optimized integrators lead to the best
accuracy in the calculations at the same computational cost among all possible

also that the Forest-Ruth-like algorithms, which are based on direct

us to increase the efficiency of the computations more than in ten times with

approximately in five times with respect to Suzuki's approach. The theoretical

problems with a set of differential equations that converge to a fixed point
that represents the optimal solution. Assuming a probabilistic model, where the
inputs are i.i.d. Gaussian variables, we compute the distribution of the
convergence rate to the attracting fixed point. Using the framework of Random
Matrix Theory, we derive a simple expression for this distribution in the
asymptotic limit of large problem size. In this limit, we find that the
distribution of the convergence rate is a scaling function, namely it is a
function of one variable that is a combination of three parameters: the number
of variables, the number of constraints and the convergence rate, rather than a
function of these parameters separately. We also estimate numerically the
distribution of computation times, namely the time required to reach a vicinity
of the attracting fixed point, and find that it is also a scaling function.
Using the problem size dependence of the distribution functions, we derive high
probability bounds on the convergence rates and on the computation times.

generalises the traditional non-process syntactical modelling of reality by
taking account of the limitations and characteristics of self-referential
syntactical information systems, discovered by Goedel and Chaitin, and the
analogies with the standard quantum formalism and its limitations. In process
physics space and quantum physics are emergent and unified, and time is a
distinct non-geometric process. Quantum phenomena are caused by fractal
topological defects embedded in and forming a growing three-dimensional fractal
process-space. Various features of the emergent physics are briefly discussed
including: quantum gravity, quantum field theory, limited causality and the
Born quantum measurement metarule, inertia, time-dilation effects, gravity and
the equivalence principle, a growing universe with a cosmological constant,
black holes and event horizons, and the emergence of classicality.

role of the gauge group is played by a tensor category. The type of tensor
category admissible (spherical, ribbon, symmetric) depends on the dimension of
the underlying manifold (<=3, <=4, any). Ordinary LGT is recovered if the
category is the (symmetric) category of representations of a compact Lie group.
In the weak coupling limit we recover discretized BF-theory in terms of a
coordinate free version of the spin foam formulation. We work on general
cellular decompositions of the underlying manifold.
  In particular, we are able to formulate LGT as well as spin foam models of
BF-type with quantum gauge group (in dimension <=4) and with supersymmetric
gauge group (in any dimension).
  Technically, we express the partition function as a sum over diagrams
denoting morphisms in the underlying category. On the LGT side this enables us
to introduce a generalized notion of gauge fixing corresponding to a
topological move between cellular decompositions of the underlying manifold. On
the BF-theory side this allows a rather geometric understanding of the state
sum invariants of Turaev/Viro, Barrett/Westbury and Crane/Yetter which we
recover.
  The construction is extended to include Wilson loop and spin network type

solution describing an asymptotically flat spacetime regular on and outside an
event horizon of topology S^1 x S^2. It describes a rotating ``black ring''.
This is the first example of an asymptotically flat vacuum solution with an
event horizon of non-spherical topology. There is a range of values for the
mass and angular momentum for which there exist two black ring solutions as
well as a black hole solution. Therefore the uniqueness theorems valid in four
dimensions do not have simple higher dimensional generalizations. It is
suggested that increasing the spin of a five dimensional black hole beyond a
critical value results in a transition to a black ring, which can have an
arbitrarily large angular momentum for a given mass.

field theories in 1+1 dimensions in terms of their Wightman functions
explicitly. As an input the integrability and general assumptions of local
quantum field theories are used. The object is to be achieved in tree steps: 1)
The S-matrix is obtained using a qualitative knowledge of the particle spectrum
and the Yang-Baxter equations. 2) Matrix elements of local operators are
calculated by means of the ""form factor program"" using the S-matrix as an
input. 3) The Wightman functions are calculated by taking sums over
intermediate states. The first step has been performed for a large number of
models and also the second one for several models. The third step is unsolved
up to now. Here the program is illustrated in terms of the sine-Gordon model
alias the massive Thirring model. Exploiting the ""off-shell"" Bethe Ansatz we
propose general formulae for form factors. For example the n-particle matrix
element for all higher currents are given and in particular all eigenvalues of
the higher conserved charges are calculated. Furthermore quantum operator
equations are obtained in terms of their matrix elements, in particular the
quantum sine-Gordon field equation. Exact expressions for the finite wave
function and mass renormalization constants are calculated.

this theorem is the original ``bridge'' between homology and cohomology
theories. The author plans to devote his two first lectures to fibre bundle
theory: this is the foundation on which the modern physics rests -- the theory
of gauge groups and the Yang-Mills fields. The idea of connection and curvature

are devoted to the Pontrjagin's degree of map theorem, to the theories of
monopoles and instantons, to the theory of the topological index of the
elliptical operator. The information accumulated to this moment allows us to
apply these theories to some questions of conformal anomalies and to the
topological aspects of QCD. More comprehensive questions of modern topology
(for example the algebraic (co)homology theories, the theory of the spectral

study approximate homogenization when the reservoir is composed of a finite set

of the dynamics of the open system is directly linked to specific (classical)
