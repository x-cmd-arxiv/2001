catalogue of returned clusters is complete above flux 200 mJy (353 GHz) while
the lowest flux reached by our method is about 70 mJy (353 GHz). We predict a
large number of detections (about 9000) in 4/5 of the sky. This large number of
SZ detections will allow a robust and consistent analysis of the evolution of
the cluster population with redshift and will have important implications for
determining the best cosmological model.

  figures available at http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~fw/ngc3077.ps.gz",,"10.1086/324633",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a comprehensive multi-wavelength study of the nearby interacting
dwarf galaxy NGC3077 (member of the M81 triplet). High resolution VLA HI
observations show that most of the atomic gas (~90%) around NGC3077 is situated
in a prominent tidal arm with a complex velocity structure. Little HI (~5 x
10^7 M_sun) is associated with NGC3077 itself. High resolution OVRO
observations of the molecular component (CO) reveal the presence of 16
molecular complexes near the center of NGC3077 (total mass: ~1.6 x 10^6 M_sun).
A virial mass analysis of the individual complexes yields a lower CO-to-H_2
conversion factor in NGC3077 than the Galactic value - a surprising result for
a dwarf galaxy. The total (atomic and molecular) gas content in the centre of
NGC3077 is displaced from the stellar component of NGC3077 -- this implies that
not only the gas at large galactocentric radii is affected by the interaction
within the triplet but also the center. We speculate that the starburst
activity of NGC3077 was triggered by this redistribution of gas in the center.
Some of these supershells are surrounded by neutral hydrogen. In a few cases,
the rims of the ionized supershells are associated with dust absorption. The
most prominent star forming region in NGC3077 as probed by Pa-alpha
observations is hidden behind a dust cloud which is traced by the molecular
complexes. Correcting for extinction we derive a star forming rate of 0.05
M_sun year^-1, i.e. given the reservoir in atomic and molecular gas in NGC3077,
star formation may proceed at a similar rate for a few 10^8 years. The
efficiency to form stars out of molecular gas in NGC3077 is similar to that in
M82.

variability class transition observed in 2000 June with the PPCs of the Indian
X-ray Astronomy Experiment. We supplement this observation with data from the
RXTE archives. The source made a transition from a steady low-hard state to a
regular oscillatory behaviour in the light curve known as bursts or class `rho'
(Belloni et al. 2000) between 2000 May 11 and 17 and reverted back to the
low-hard state on 2000 June 27. A gradual change in the burst recurrence time
from about 75 s to about 40 s was observed which then increased to about 120 s
during the ~ 40 days of class `rho'. The regular bursts disappeared from the
X-ray light curves and the class transition was observed to occur within 1.5
hours on 2000 June 27 with the PPCs. A correlation is found between the
observed QPO frequency at 5-8 Hz in the quiescent phase and the average X-ray
intensity of the source during the class `rho'. We notice a strong similarity
between the properties of the source during the class `rho' and those during
the oscillatory phase of the observations of class `alpha'. From the timing and
spectral analysis, it is found that the observed properties of the source over
tens of days during the class `rho' are identical to those over a time scale of
a few hundreds of seconds in the class `alpha'. Examining the light curves from
the beginning of the RXTE/PCA and RXTE/ASM observations, it is found that the
change of state from radio-quiet low-hard state to high state occurs through
the X-ray classes `rho' and `alpha' which appear together during the state
transition. It is further inferred that the source switches from low-hard state
to the class `rho' through the intermediate class `alpha'.

gas loss are revisited. The escape time of the gas is compared with the cooling
time, which provides an additional condition not previously considered. Its
consequences for the allowed mass range of the halo is calculated. It is shown
that sufficient gas is retained to form massive dark objects and quasars even
for moderately massive halos but a decline is expected at low redshifts.
Subsequently, a gaseous disk forms with a radial extent of a ~kpc, spun up by
tidal torques and magnetized by supernovae fields with fields strengths of
$10-100 \mu G$. In a model of a self-similar accretion flow in an initially
dominant halo, it is shown that for typical halo parameters, about $10^8
M_\odot$ accretes via small magnetic stresses (or alternatively by self-gravity
induced instability or by alpha viscosity) in $10^8$ years into a compact
region. A model of a self-gravitating evolution of a compact magnetized disk,
which is relevant when a significant fraction of the disk mass falls in, is
presented, and it has a rapid collapse time scale of a million years. The two
disk solutions, one for accretion in an imposed halo potential and the other
for self-gravitating disk, obtained here, have general utility and can be
adapted to other contexts like protostellar disks as well.

suspended particles which play the role of passive tracers. Since an actual

reaches its maximum value in the strong Yukawa coupling limit when Yukawa
couplings are essentially larger than gauge ones at the Grand Unification
scale. In this limit the solutions of the renormalisation group equations are
attracted to the infrared and Hill type effective fixed lines or surfaces in
the Yukawa coupling parameter space. They are concentrated in the vicinity of
quasi fixed points for $Y_i(0)\to\infty$. However the solutions are attracted
to such points rather weakly. For this reason when all $Y_i(0)\sim 1$ the
solutions of the renormalisation group equations are gathered near a line in
the Hill type effective surface. In the paper the approximate solutions for the

compatible with local realism once this concept is properly formulated (without
presuming atomism in addition to locality). Relativity Theory is reconstructed
in the context of a preferred frame, but so as to secure the Relativity
Principle in every experiment except the measurement of the preferred frame,
defined by a null result for the dipole component of the Microwave Background
Radiation (MBR). The 3D soliton approach to physical modelling is found to be
consistent with both Special Relativity and Quantum Mechanical Nonlocality,
exemplified by the EPR paradox.

form of general relativity, we show how the discussion in \cite{SavQFT1} of a
history version of free, scalar quantum field theory can be augmented in such a
way as to include the quantisation of the unit-length, time-like vector that
determines a Lorentzian foliation of Minkowski spacetime. We employ a Hilbert
bundle construction that is motivated by: (i) discussing the role of the
external Lorentz group in the existing history quantum field theory
\cite{SavQFT1}; and (ii) considering a specific representation of the extended
history algebra obtained from the multi-symplectic representation of scalar
field theory.
