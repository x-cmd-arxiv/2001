spiral galaxy M51 (NGC 5194), which has a low-luminosity Seyfert 2 nucleus. The
X-ray image shows the nucleus, southern extranuclear cloud, and northern loop,
the morphology of the extended emission being very similar to those seen in
radio continuum and optical emission line images. The X-ray spectrum of the
nucleus is well represented by a model consisting of soft thermal plasma with
kT ~0.5 keV, a very hard continuum, and an Fe Kalpha emission line at 6.45 keV
with an equivalent width of >2 keV. The very strong Fe line and the flat
continuum indicate that the nucleus is obscured by a column density in excess
of 10^24 cm^-2 and the spectrum is dominated by reflected emission from cold
matter near the nucleus. The X-ray spectra of the extranuclear clouds are well
fitted by a thermal plasma model with kT ~0.5 keV. This spectral shape and
morphology strongly suggest that the clouds are shock heated by the bi-polar
outflow from the nucleus. The shock velocities of the extranuclear cloud and
northern loop inferred from the temperatures of the X-ray gas are 690 km/s and
660 km/s, respectively. By assuming a steady-state situation in which the
emission of the extranuclear clouds is powered by the jets, the mechanical
energy in the jets is found to be comparable to the bolometric luminosity of
the nucleus.

2000+ programme. Infrared interferometers are a highly sensitive astronomical
instruments that enable us to observe terrestrial planets around nearby stars.
In this context the Infrared Space Interferometry Mission (IRSI)/ DARWIN is
studied. The current design calls for a constellation of 6 free flying
telescopes using 1.5m mirrors, plus one hub and one master spacecraft. As the
baseline trajectory an orbit about the second collinear libration point of the
Earth-Sun system has been selected. The thermal radiation from the
interplanetary dust cloud that surrounds the Sun, the so-called zodiacal
infrared foreground, is a major concern for any high-sensitivity infrared
mission. The most reliable information about this radiation comes from the
measurements by NASA's Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) mission. There are
various ways to detect faint terrestrial planets despite the bright foreground.
We find that, using integration times in the order of 30h, the baseline mission
scenario is capable of detecting earth-sized exo-planets out to 14pc. We seize
the suggestion that increasing the heliocentric distance of the instrument
would make the observing conditions even better. A dust model that was fitted
to the COBE measurements shows that an observing location of DARWIN in the
outer solar system would potentially reduce the zodiacal foreground by a factor
of 100, effectively increasing the number of potential target stars by almost a
factor of 30.

making careful allowance for contaminating intragroup emission. The L_X:L_B and
L_X:L_{FIR} relations of spiral galaxies in groups appear to be
indistinguishable from those in other environments, however the elliptical
galaxies fall into two distinct classes. The first class is central-dominant
group galaxies which are very X-ray luminous, and may be the focus of group
cooling flows. All other early-type galaxies in groups belong to the second
class, which populates an almost constant band of L_X/L_B over the range 9.8 <
log L_B < 11.3. The X-ray emission from these galaxies can be explained by a
superposition of discrete galactic X-ray sources together with a contribution
from hot gas lost by stars, which varies a great deal from galaxy to galaxy. In
the region where the optical luminosity of the non-central group galaxies
overlaps with the dominant galaxies, the dominant galaxies are over an order of
magnitude more luminous in X-rays.
  We also compared these group galaxies with a sample of isolated early-type
galaxies, and used previously published work to derive L_X:L_B relations as a
function of environment. The non-dominant group galaxies have mean L_X/L_B
ratios very similar to that of isolated galaxies, and we see no significant
correlation between L_X/L_B and environment. We suggest that previous findings
of a steep L_X:L_B relation for early-type galaxies result largely from the

Kleinmann as nearby (within about 1 kpc of the sun) AGB stars with high
mass-loss rates, greater than 1E-6 solar masses per year. Ground-based
near-infrared photometry, data obtained by IRAS and kinematic data from the
literature are combined to investigate the properties of these stars. The light
amplitude in the near-infrared is found to be correlated with period, and this
amplitude decreases with increasing wavelength. Statistical tests show that
there is no reason to suspect any difference in the period distributions of the
carbon- and oxygen-rich stars for periods less than 1000 days, and no
carbon-rich star has a period longer than 1000 days. The colours are consistent
with those of cool stars with evolved circumstellar dust-shells. Luminosities
and distances are estimated using a period-luminosity relation. Mass-loss
rates, estimated from the 60 micron fluxes, show a correlation with pulsation
period and is tightly correlated with the K-[12] colour. The kinematics and
scale-height of the sample shows that the sources with periods less than 1000
days must have low mass main-sequence progenitors. It is argued that the three
oxygen-rich stars with periods over 1000 days probably had intermediate mass
main-sequence progenitors with remaining stars having an average progenitor
mass of about 1.3 solar masses. The average lifetime of stars in this phase is
estimated to be about 4.0E4 years, indicating they will undergo at most one
more thermal pulse before leaving the AGB.

The sensitivity to tilt ordering is achieved by tuning the incident x-ray
energy to the L$_I$, L$_{II}$ and L$_{III}$ absorption edges of Pr and La,
respectively. The resulting energy-dependent profiles are characterized by a
dipole-resonant peak and higher energy fine structure. The polarization
dependence is predominantly $\sigma$-to-$\pi$ and the azimuthal dependence
follows a sin-squared behavior. These results are similar to those obtained in
recent x-ray scattering studies of orbital ordering carried out in these same
materials at the Mn K edge. They lead to a description of the cross-section in
terms of Templeton scattering in which the tilt ordering breaks the symmetry at
the rare earth site. The most interesting result of the present work is our
observation that octahedral tilt ordering persists above the orbital ordering
transition temperatures in all three samples. Indeed, we identify separate
structural transitions which may be associated with the onset of orbital and
tilt ordering, respectively, and characterize the loss of tilt ordering versus

remanent magnetization in the $\pm J$ Edward-Anderson spin glass model with a
uniform random distribution of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions

$m$ reveals a slow decrease with time, which can be approximated by a power
law:$m(t)=m_{\infty}+ ({t\over a_{0}})^{a_{1}}$, $a_{1} < 0$. Moreover, its
relaxation does not lead it into one of the ground states, and therefore the
system is trapped in metastable isoenergetic microstates remaining magnetized.
Such behaviour is discussed in terms of a random walk the system performs on
its available configuration space.

Knot Theory Ram. 14 (2005), no. 5, 571-602",,,"math.GT",,"  It is well-known that no knot can be cancelled in a connected sum with
another knot, whereas every link can be cancelled up to link homotopy in a
(componentwise) connected sum with another link. In this paper we address the
question whether the noncancellation property of knots holds for some
(piecewise-linear) links up to some stronger analogue of link homotopy, which
still does not distinguish between sufficiently close C^0-approximations of a
topological link. We introduce a sequence of such increasingly stronger
equivalence relations under the name of k-quasi-isotopy, k=1,2,...; all of them
are weaker than isotopy (in the sense of Milnor). We prove that every link can
be cancelled up to peripheral structure preserving isomorphism of any quotient
of the fundamental group, functorially invariant under k-quasi-isotopy;
functoriality means that the isomorphism between the quotients for links
related by an allowable crossing change fits in the commutative diagram with
the fundamental group of the complement to the intermediate singular link. The
proof invokes Baer's theorem on the join of subnormal locally nilpotent
subgroups. On the other hand, the integral generalized (lk\ne 0) Sato-Levine
invariant \tilde\beta is invariant under 1-quasi-isotopy, but is not determined
by any quotient of the fundamental group (endowed with the peripheral
structure), functorially invariant under 1-quasi-isotopy - in contrast to
Waldhausen's theorem.
  As a byproduct, we use \tilde\beta to determine the image of the
Kirk-Koschorke invariant \tilde\sigma of fibered link maps.

  math.GT/0312007","J. Knot Theory Ram. 14 (2005), no. 5, 603-626",,,"math.GT",,"  Geometric aspects of the filtration on classical links by k-quasi-isotopy are
discussed, including the effect of Whitehead doubling, relations with Smythe's
n-splitting and Kobayashi's k-contractibility. One observation is:
\omega-quasi-isotopy is equivalent to PL isotopy for links in a homotopy
3-sphere (resp. contractible open 3-manifold) M if and only if M is
homeomorphic to S^3 (resp. R^3). As a byproduct of the proof of the ""if"" part,
we obtain that every compact subset of an acyclic open set in a compact
orientable 3-manifold M is contained in a PL homology 3-ball in M.
  We show that k-quasi-isotopy implies (k+1)-cobordism of Cochran and Orr. If
z^{m-1}(c_0 + c_1 z^2 + ... + c_n z^{2n}) denotes the Conway polynomial of an
m-component link, it follows that the residue class of c_k modulo
gcd(c_0,..,c_{k-1}) is invariant under k-quasi-isotopy. Another corollary is
that each Cochran's derived invariant \beta^k is also invariant under
k-quasi-isotopy, and therefore assumes the same value on all PL links,
sufficiently C^0-close to a given topological link. This overcomes an algebraic
obstacle encountered by Kojima and Yamasaki, who ""became aware of impossibility
to define"" for wild links what for PL links is equivalent to the formal power
series \sum \beta^n z^n by a change of variable.

characterizing important features of the inverse cascade such as it's range,
how energy is distributed over the range and how energy flows through the

associated with the existence of an inverse cascade. These investigations
demonstrate that the extent of the inverse cascade range and the behavior of
the energy distribution are in agreement with dimensional predictions. The
energy flow in the inverse cascade range is shown to be well described by exact
mathematical predictions obtained from the Navier-Stokes equation. At no time
does the energy flow in the inverse cascade range produced by the e-m cell
behave inertially or in a scale invariant manner. Evidence that the cascade
could become scale invariant should an inertial range develop is presented, as
are the requirements that a system must satisfy to create such an inertial
range.

towards the surface for the incidence angles of 30, 45, and 60 degree at a
translational energy of 96 kJ/mol. Energy loss is primarily from the normal
component of the translational energy. It is transfered for somewhat more than
half to the surface and the rest is transfered mostly to rotational motion. The
spread in the change of translational energy has a basis in the spread of the
transfer to rotational energy, and can be enhanced by raising of the surface
temperature through the transfer process to the surface motion.

simulation of teleportation with the x = 1/2 Werner state. Thus teleportation
using this state does not involve nonlocality even though the fidelity achieved
