core of a neutron star, developed by Konenkov & Geppert (2000), both to neutron
star models based on different equations of state and to different initial
magnetic field structures. When initially the core and the surface magnetic
field are of the same order of magnitude, the rate of flux expulsion from the
core is almost independent of the equation of state, and the evolution of the
surface field decouples from the core field evolution with increasing
stiffness. When the surface field is initially much stronger than the core
field, the magnetic and rotational evolution resembles to those of a neutron
star with a purely crustal field configuration; the only difference is the
occurence of a residual field. In case of an initially submerged field
significant differences from the standard evolution occur only during the early
period of neutron star's life, until the field has been rediffused to the
surface. The reminder of the episode of submergence is a correlation of the
residual field strength with the submergence depth of the initial field. We
discuss the effect of the rediffusion of the magnetic field on to the
difference between the real and the active age of young pulsars and on their
braking indices. Finally, we estimate the shear stresses built up by the moving
fluxoids at the crust--core interface and show that preferentially in neutron
stars with a soft equation of state these stresses may cause crust cracking.

accounts for the bulk of internal disk stress. In contradiction with the
traditional view, the stress from this MHD turbulence does not diminish near
the marginally stable orbit, and the ratio of magnetic stress to pressure rises
sharply there. Examples of the consequences include: an increase in accretion
efficiency that may also be time- and circumstance-dependent; a decrease in the
rate of black hole spin-up by accretion; and generation of disk luminosity
fluctuations. Preliminary results from numerical simulations lend support to
analytic estimates of these effects.

This is further confirmed by the PHA ratio of the raw data and ratio of the
lightcurves in different energy bands. These results, combined with the fact
that the 0.5 -- 10 Hz QPO disappears during the dip and that the Comptonized

a direct connection between the X-ray and radio properties of the source.

  Aug 2001","Astrophys.J. 556 (2001) 562-581","10.1086/321609",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a detailed interpretation of the spectrum of the cosmic infrared
background longwards of 5 microns and of galaxy counts from various surveys at
mid-infrared, far-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths by evolving the
mid-infrared local luminosity function with redshift. We find that all
evolutionary models that fit the counts require a flattening at z~0.8 to avoid
overproducing the CIRB. About 80% of the 140 micron CIRB is produced at 0 < z <
1.5 while only about 30% of the 850 micron background is produced within the
same redshift range. The nature of the evolution is translated into a measure
of the dust enshrouded star formation rate density as a function of redshift
and compared with estimates from optical/near-infrared surveys. We find that
the dust obscured star formation rate density appears to peak at z=0.8+/-0.1,
much sooner than previously thought, with a value of 0.25+/-0.12 M_sun/yr and
remains almost constant up to z~2. At least 70% of this star formation takes
place in luminous infrared galaxies with L_IR > 10^11 L_sun. The long
wavelength observations that constrain our evolutionary models do not strongly
trace the evolution at z > 2 and a drop off in the dust enshrouded star
formation rate is consistent with both the CIRB spectrum and the number counts.
However, a comparison with the infrared luminosity function derived from
extinction corrected optical/UV observations of the Lyman-break galaxy (LBG)
population at z~3 suggests that the flat comoving star formation rate seen
between redshifts 0.8 and 2, extends up to a redshift of z~4.

13CO integrated intensities, R, are found in nearly every galaxy observed.
There is an overall variation in R of 20-40% from the inner 2 kpc to the disk.
Roughly a third of the survey galaxies have such gradients in R detected above
the 2-sigma confidence level. Though some galaxies show a lower central value
of R, on average R inside 2 kpc is 10-30% higher than R outside of 2 kpc.
  An increase in the CO/13CO intensity ratio from disk to nucleus may imply
that the conversion factor between CO intensity and H2 column density, X, is
lower in galactic nuclei. Also variations in physical conditions, most notably
the gas kinetic temperature, affect both R and X. Abundance variations probably
do not cause the gradient in R, though we do not rule out a decrease in
effective cloud column densities in galactic nuclei possibly caused by
destructive starburst superwinds. A modest rise in temperature (less than a
factor of 2 or 3) from outside a 2 kpc radius towards the nucleus can easily
account for the observed gradient. These results support previous work implying
that X is lower in the center of the Milky Way and probably most galactic
nuclei. Therefore calculating H2 masses using the standard Galactic X-factor,
especially within the central few kpc of galaxies, overestimates the true mass
by factors of a few. The standard X-factor still appears to be appropriate for
galactic disks.

as a zero-energy trajectory between two equilibria in an auxiliary classical
mechanical system. Finding it is similar to e.g. computing heteroclinic orbits
in celestial mechanics. The overall lesson of this study is that an examination

characterized by the competition between the dot-dot tunneling coupling $V_{C}$
and the level broadening $\Delta$ in the dots (dot-lead coupling). When
$V_{C}/\Delta < 1$, the Kondo resonance is formed between each dot and lead,
which is replaced by a spin-singlet state in the dots at low gate voltages. The
gate voltage dependence of $G$ has a sharp peak of $2 e^2/h$ in height in the

$G$ survives when the energy levels are different between the dots. When $V_{C}

YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBCO). Unlike in the case of YBCO, the CPBR for LSCO does not
show obvious photon energy dependence. In YBCZO the CPBR shows strong photon
energy dependence similar to YBCO, but with a red shift in the peak position.
Analysis of these results strongly favours a physical picture based on
electronic phase separation in high Tc superconductivity.

the idea that light transmitted through a sandwich of two turbid cells can be

and/or leakage of light take place at the interface between the cells, we
establish a so-called ""multiplication rule"", which relates the intensity
autocorrelation function of light transmitted through the double-cell sandwich
to the autocorrelation functions of individual cells by a simple
multiplication. To test the proposed method, we perform a series of DWS
experiments using colloidal gels as model nonergodic media. Our experimental
data are consistent with the theoretical predictions, allowing quantitative
characterization of nonergodic media and demonstrating the validity of the

consisting of several chains in dilute solutions of amphiphilic heteropolymers.
We have seen that the mesoglobules often possess an essentially micellar

strongly sequence and concentration dependent. In particular, by means of
lattice Monte Carlo simulation we consider structures formed by a number of
tri-block sequences and their certain mutations. For sequences consisting of
two hydrophilic ends with a hydrophobic middle the size distribution of the
resulting particles is rather narrow, i.e. mesoglobules are being formed.
However, in the case of sequences with two hydrophobic ends and a hydrophilic
middle a new type of structures seems to be prevalent. These consist of small
mesoglobules interconnected by hydrophilic bridges. Clearly, on increasing the
concentration these networked structures would play an important role resulting
in a rapid onset of a gel-like behaviour.

overview of a flexible software framework facilitating the design and control

hierarchy of polymorphic synthesis objects, representing modal structures of
various complexity. As a method of generalizing all interactions among the
elements of a modal system, an abstract notion of {\it energy} is introduced,
and a set of energy transfer functions is provided. Such abstraction leads to a
design where the dynamics of interactions can be largely separated from the
specifics of particular modal structures, yielding an easily configurable and
expandable system. A real-time version of the framework has been implemented as
a set of C++ classes along with an integrating shell and a GUI, and is
currently being used to design and play modal instruments, as well as to survey
fundamental properties of various modal algorithms.

the second inflation (new inflation) is set. In this model, the initial value

inflation produces the primordial fluctuations on the large cosmological scales

obtained through the relativistic Hartree approximation (RHA) of summing
baryonic tadpole diagrams. Generalization of such a state to include the
quantum effects for the scalar meson fields through the $\sigma$-meson
condensates amounts to summing over a class of multiloop diagrams. The
techniques of thermofield dynamics (TFD) method are used for the finite
temperature and finite density calculations. The in-medium nucleon and sigma
meson masses are also calculated in a self consistent manner. We examine the
liquid-gas phase transition at low temperatures ($\approx$ 20 MeV), as well as
apply the formalism to high temperatures to examine for a possible chiral
symmetry restoration phase transition.

those combinations of transport coefficients which govern the fission process.
This is based on experience with numerical calculations within the linear
response approach and the locally harmonic approximation. A reduced version of
the latter is seen to comply with Kramers' simplified picture of fission. It is
argued that for variable inertia his formula has to be generalized, as already
required by the need that for overdamped motion the inertia must not appear at
all. This situation may already occur above T=2 MeV, where the rate is
determined by the Smoluchowski equation. Consequently, comparison with
experimental results do not give information on the effective damping rate, as
often claimed, but on a special combination of local stiffnesses and the
friction coefficient calculated at the barrier.

measured by the WA98 experiment is analysed. A quark gluon plasma is assumed to
be formed initially, which expands, cools, hadronizes, and undergoes
freeze-out. A rich hadronic equation of state is used and the transverse
expansion of the interacting system is taken into account. The recent estimates
of photon production in quark-matter (at two loop level) along with the
dominant reactions in the hadronic matter leading to photons are used. About
half of the radiated photons are seen to have a thermal origin. The same
treatment and the initial conditions provide a very good description to
hadronic spectra measured by several groups and the intermediate mass dileptons
measured by the NA50 experiment, lending a strong support to the conclusion
that quark gluon plasma has been formed in these collisions.

produced by the vacuum of the cavity field. The peak of the transmitted wave
packet generally occurs at the instant given by the expression for phase time
even if that instant is earlier than the instant at which incident wave
packet's peak enters the cavity and thus the phase time can be considered as
the appropriate measure of the time required for the atom to traverse the
cavity. We show that the phase tunneling time for ultra-cold atoms could be
both super - and sub - classical time and we show how this behaviour can be
understood in terms of the momentum dependence of the phase of transmission
amplitude. The passage of the atom through the cavity is unique as it involves
a coherent addition of the transition amplitudes corresponding to both barrier
and well. New features such as the splitting of the wave packet arise from the
entanglement between the center of mass motion and the electronic as well as
field states in the cavity.

are the optimal building blocks to encode structural information? This can be
analysed by substituting the operations of addition and multiplication of
conventional arithmetic with translation and rotation. It is argued that at the
molecular level, the best component for encoding discretised structural
information is carbon. Living organisms discovered this billions of years ago,
and used carbon as the back-bone for constructing proteins that function
according to their structure. Structural analysis of polypeptide chains shows
that an efficient and versatile structural language of 20 building blocks is
needed to implement all the tasks carried out by proteins. Properties of amino
acids indicate that the present triplet genetic code was preceded by a more
primitive one, coding for 10 amino acids using two nucleotide bases.
