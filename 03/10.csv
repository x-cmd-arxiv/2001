  Granada, Spain; 4 pages",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The possibility of radio galaxies being random sample of otherwise normal
elliptical galaxies is tested. Starting with the observed optical luminosity
functions for elliptical galaxies, it is shown that the probability of an
elliptical forming a radio source is a continuous, increasing function of
optical luminosity, precisely proportional to square of the optical luminosity
of the galaxy. Once the probability function is fixed, the luminosity function
of normal elliptical galaxies is used as input for Monte Carlo simulations that
reproduce the distribution of radio galaxies in the radio-optical luminosity
plane. Our results show that radio galaxies are luminosity biased, but
otherwise random sample of elliptical galaxies. This unified view of radio and
non-radio ellipticals also explains the well known difference of 0.5 mag in
average optical luminosity between FRI and FRII radio galaxies as a simple
selection effect. Specifically, FRII appear preferentially in smaller galaxies
because both radio and optical luminosity functions are steep, so there is a
negligible probability of observing a powerful radio source associated with a
bright galaxy; no intrinsic physical differences between FRI and FRII host
galaxies is required.

propagation of acoustic waves. We estimate the amplitude of these effects. For
the Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP), Rayleigh scattering increases the
anisotropy spectrum by 0.1% at the most. For the highest frequencies of the
Planck Surveyor, the effects of Rayleigh scattering are much more dramatic
(decreasing the anisotropy spectrum by 3% at \nu~550GHz and l~1000). The
relative difference between the spectra of low and high frequencies is imposed
by an oscillation with a function of multipole l and the oscillation amplitude
is up to 0.5% between 100 and 550GHz. Rayleigh scattering also slows the
decoupling between radiation and matter, but the effect is undetectably small.

galactic Dark Matter, as they could be produced by exotic sources. On the other
hand, antiprotons are anyway produced by standard nuclear reactions of cosmic
ray nuclei on interstellar matter. This process is responsible for a background
flux that must be carefully determined to estimate the detectability of an
hypothetical exotic signal. Estimates of this background suffer from potential
uncertainties of various origins. The propagation of cosmic antiprotons depends
on several physical characteristics of the Galaxy which are poorly known.
Antiprotons are created from cosmic protons and helium nuclei whose fluxes were
not measured with great accuracy until very recently. Calculations of
antiproton fluxes make use of nuclear physics models with their own
shortcomings and uncertainties. The goal of this paper is to give a new
evaluation of the cosmic antiproton flux along with the associated
uncertainties. The propagation parameters were tightly constrained in Maurin et
al. 2001 by an analysis of cosmic ray nuclei data in the framework of a
two-zone diffusion model and we apply these parameters to the propagation of
antiprotons. We use the recently published data on proton and helion fluxes,
and we find that this particular source of uncertainty has become negligible.
The Monte Carlo program DTUNUC was used to carefully examine nuclear reactions.
We find that all the cosmic antiproton fluxes naturally coming out of the
calculation are fully compatible with experimental data. Uncertainties in this
flux have been strongly reduced. Those related to propagation are less than
25%. All other possible sources of uncertainty have also been studied.

its origin in the equatorial section of the convection zone. We apply the

sharing $t_f$ has a power law divergence at $\sigma_c$ with a universal

at the critical load $t_f$ jumps to a finite value, analogous to second and

MICROMEGAS technology. This technology incorporates an insulating grid,
sandwiched between the micro-mesh and the anode-pad plane, which provides an
uniform 200 $\mu$m amplification gap. The uniformity of the amplification gap
thickness has been verified under several experimental conditions. The gain
performances of the detector are presented and compared to the values obtained
with detectors using cylindrical micro spacers. The new design presents several
technical and financial advantages.

overlapping strings of length K. How unique is the converse, i.e.,
reconstruction of amino acid sequences using the set of K-strings obtained in
the decomposition? This problem may be transformed into the problem of counting
the number of Eulerian loops in an Euler graph, though the well-known formula
must be modified. By exhaustive enumeration and by using the modified formula
we show that the reconstruction is unique at K equal or greater than 5 for an
overwhelming majority of the proteins in the PDB.seq database. The
corresponding Euler graphs provide a means to study the structure of repeated
segments in protein sequences.

paradox occurs if each party measures either the position or momentum of his
particle. The paradox can be ascribed to the anticommutation of certain
translation operators in phase space. We then rephrase the paradox in terms of
modular and binary variables. The origin of the paradox is then due to the fact
that the associativity of addition of modular variables is true only for
c-numbers but does not hold for operators.

highly entangled 4-photon state. Due to interference, which is similar to
bunching from thermal emission, this state is not simply a product of two
pairs. The observation of this state can be achieved by splitting the two
emission modes at beam splitters and subsequent detection of a photon in each
output. Here we describe the features of this state and give a Bell theorem for
a 4-photon test of local realistic hidden variable theories.
