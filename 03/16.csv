confirms the Zinn & West (1984) value contrasting with recent spectroscopic

long-base colour index U-V. A comparison of the unreddened (V, U-V)
distribution of HB stars with a canonical ZAHB model (Dorman et al. 1993)
reveals that the hottest stars rise above the model line. We find this similar
to the 'u-jump' found in the Stroemgren photometry (Grundahl et al. 1998,

procedure for use in Monte Carlo radiation transfer codes with sources of
temperature-independent opacity, such as astrophysical dust. The technique
utilizes the fact that Monte Carlo simulations track individual photon packets,
so we may easily determine where their energy is absorbed. When a packet is
absorbed, it heats a particular cell within the envelope, raising its
temperature. To enforce radiative equilibrium, the absorbed packet is
immediately re-emitted. To correct the cell temperature, the frequency of the
re-emitted packet is chosen so that it corrects the temperature of the spectrum
previously emitted by the cell. The re-emitted packet then continues being
scattered, absorbed, and re-emitted until it finally escapes from the envelope.
As the simulation runs, the envelope heats up, and the emergent spectral energy
distribution (SED) relaxes to its equilibrium value, without iteration. This
implies that the equilibrium temperature calculation requires no more
computation time than the SED calculation of an equivalent pure scattering
model with fixed temperature. In addition to avoiding iteration, our method
conserves energy exactly, because all injected photon packets eventually
escape. Furthermore, individual packets transport energy across the entire
system because they are never destroyed. This long-range communication, coupled
with the lack of iteration, implies that our method does not suffer the
convergence problems commonly associated with lambda-iteration. To verify our
temperature correction procedure, we compare our results to standard benchmark
tests, and finally we present the results of simulations for two-dimensional
axisymmetric density structures.

Compact Array interferometric HI survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC); it
could also be applied to a significant number of nearby disk galaxies, thanks
to the next generation of interferometric facilities, such as the extended VLA
and CARMA.
  The method consists of computing the Spectral Correlation Function (SCF) for
a spectral-line map of a face-on galaxy. The SCF quantifies the correlation
between spectra at different map positions as a function of their separation,
and is sensitive to the properties of both the gas mass distribution and the
gas velocity field. It is likely that spatial correlation properties of the gas
density and velocity fields in a galactic disk are sensitive to the value of
the scale height of the gas disk. A scale-free turbulent cascade is unlikely to
extend to scales much larger than the disk scale height, as the disk dynamics
on those larger scales should be dominated by two dimensional motions.
  We find a clear feature in the SCF of the LMC HI disk, on the scale of
approximately 180 pc, which we identify as the disk scale height. We are also
tentatively able to map variations of the scale height over the disk.

recognised that ultra-violet (UV) and H-alpha emission line data must be
corrected for the effects of extinction, the magnitude of the required
correction is uncertain. Even when these corrections are made there remains a
significant discrepancy between SFRs derived from UV and H-alpha measurements
compared with those derived from far-infrared (FIR) and radio luminosities.
Since the FIR/radio derived SFRs are not affected by extinction, and simple
corrections to reconcile the UV and H-alpha measurement with these do not fully
account for the discrepancies, a more sophisticated correction may be required.
Recent results suggest that at least part of the solution may be a form of
extinction which increases with increasing SFR (or luminosity, given the common
assumption that SFR is proportional to luminosity). We present an analysis of
the effects of a dust reddening dependent on star formation rate applied to
estimators of SFR. We show (1) that the discrepancies between H-alpha and
FIR/radio SFR estimates may be explained by such an effect, and we present an
iterative method for applying the correction; and (2) UV-based estimates of SFR
are harder to reconcile with FIR/radio estimates using this method, although
the extent of the remaining discrepancy is less than for a non-SFR-dependent
correction. Particularly at high redshift, our understanding of extinction at
UV wavelengths may require a still more complex explanation.

densification mechanisms in silicon dioxide thin films deposited on an
amorphous silica surface, according to a simplified ion-beam assisted
deposition (IBAD) scenario. We compare the structures resulting from the
deposition of near-thermal (1 eV) SiO$_{2}$ particles to those obtained with
increasing fraction of 30 eV SiO$_{2}$ particles. Our results show that there
is an energy interval - between 12 and 15 eV per condensing SiO$_2$ unit on
average - for which the growth leads to a dense, low-stress amorphous
structure, in satisfactory agreement with the results of low-energy ion-beam
experiments. We also find that the crossover between low- and high-density
films is associated with a tensile to compressive stress transition, and a
simultaneous healing of structural defects of the {\em a-}SiO$_2$ network,
namely three- and four-fold rings. It is observed, finally, that densification
proceeds through significant changes at intermediate length scales (4--10 \AA),
leaving essentially unchanged the ``building blocks'' of the network, viz. the
Si(O$_{1/2}$)$_{4}$ tetrahedra. This latter result is in qualitative agreement
with the mechanism proposed to explain the irreversible densification of
amorphous silica recovered from high pressures ($\sim$ 15--20 GPa).

that the delocalization can be caused by external pressure via a resonant

small. 2. The initial Hubbard U is split by renormalization into a set of

to this separation is the disappearance of the quantum Hall (QH) plateau for

positive magnetoresistance emerges in the weakest fields, from which about a
factor of two different mobilities in the sublayers have been deduced. A model
is suggested to explain the existence of the QH plateaux close to the
fundamental values in a system of two parallel layers with different

On the basis of scanning tunnelling microscopy experiments, this transition was
claimed to be the manifestation of a surface charge density wave (SCDW), i.e. a
periodic redistribution of charge, possibly accompanied by a periodic lattice
distortion, which determines a change of the surface symmetry.
  Recent He diffraction studies of the (3x3) long range order have shown the
transition to be of the order-disorder type with a critical temperature Tc=220
K and belonging to the 3-state Potts' universality class. These findings
clearly exclude an SCDW driven mechanism at 220 K, but they cannot exclude the
occurence of a displacive transition at higher temperature. Here we present
photoelectron diffraction data taken at 300 K and photoemission data taken up

expressed in terms of the frequency dependent reflection factor which is
specified in the rest frame of the mirror and the transformation from the
inertial modes to the modes at rest with respect to the mirror. In this
perspective, the DF model is simply the limiting case when this factor is unity
for all frequencies. In the second part, we introduce an alternative model
which is based on self-interactions described by an action principle. When the
coupling is constant, this model can be solved exactly and gives rise to a
partially reflecting mirror. The usefulness of this dynamical model lies in the
possibility of switching off the coupling between the mirror and the field.
This allows to obtain regularized expressions for the fluxes in situations
where they are singular when using the DF model. Two examples are considered.
The first concerns the flux induced by the disappearance of the reflection
condition, a situation which bears some analogies with the end of the
evaporation of a black hole. The second case concerns the flux emitted by a
uniformly accelerated mirror.

parity (``axial'') $w$-modes. With $R$ the radius of the star, $M$ its mass,
$R_{i}$ the radius of the inner core and $M_{i}$ the mass of such core, it is
shown that stars with $R/M\geq 5$ can have several trapped $w$-modes, as long
as $R_{i}/M_{i}<2.6$. Excitation of the least damped $w$-mode is confirmed for
a few models. All of these stars can only exist however, for values of the
ratio between the densities of the two phases, greater than $\sim 46$. We also
show that stars with a phase transition and a given value of $R/M$ can have far
more trapped modes than a homogeneous single density star with the same value
of $R/M$, provided both $R/M$ and $R_{i}/M_{i}$ are smaller than 3. If the
phase transition is very fast, most of the stars with trapped modes are
unstable to radial oscillations. We compute the time of instability, and find
it to be comparable to the damping of the $w$-mode excited in most cases where
$w$-mode excitation is likely. If on the other hand the phase transition is
slow, all the stars are stable to radial oscillations.

separation into a generalized Born term containing ground-state properties
only, and a residual contribution describing the model-dependent internal

Lorentz-invariant residual amplitudes. Particular emphasis is laid on a
physical interpretation of these quantities as characterizing the spatial
distributions of the induced electric polarization and magnetization of
hadrons. It is argued that three dipole polarizabilities, namely the
longitudinal electric alpha_L(q^2), the transverse electric alpha_T(q^2), and
the magnetic beta(q^2) ones are required in order to fully reconstruct local
polarizations induced by soft external fields in a hadron. One of these
polarizabilities, alpha_T(q^2), describes an effect of higher order in the soft
final-photon momentum q'. We argue that the associated spatial distributions
obtained via the Fourier transforms in the Breit frame are meaningful even for
such a light particle as the pion. The spatial distributions are determined at
large distances r ~ 1/m_pi for pions, kaons, and octet baryons by use of ChPT.

$2.6\sigma$ deviation from the standard model value. We show that it puts
strong constraints on the parameter space of the two-higgs doublet model (2HDM)
II. The dominant contribution of the Higgses comes at the two-loop level, and
in order to explain the data it favors a pseudoscalar $A$ with a light mass
range and a large $\tan\beta$. At 95% C.L., upper limit for
$m_{\scriptscriptstyle A}$ is $29 (55) (85)$ GeV for $\tan\beta=30 (45)
  (60)$, and $\tan \beta$ is bounded below at 17. This is in sharp contrast to
the conclusion one draws from considering one-loop Higgs contributions alone.
Finally, we also discuss the role of the Higgs contributions in the minimal
supersymmetric standard model.

not only the high energy and transverse coherence of the X-ray beam, but also
of the possibility of focusing it to a spot with a small radius, hopefully in
the range of the laser wavelength. Along this route one obtains very large
electric fields, much larger than those obtainable with any optical laser of
the same power. In this letter we discuss the possibility of obtaining an
electric field so high that electron-positron pairs are spontaneously produced
in vacuum (Schwinger pair production). We find that if X-ray optics can be
improved to approach the diffraction limit of focusing, and if the power of the
planned X-ray FELs can be increased to the terawatt region, then there is ample
room for an investigation of the Schwinger pair production mechanism.

D(irichlet)-particle, embeded in it, due to scattering by a moving string. The
induced spacetime has curvature only up to a radius that depends on the energy
of the incident string. Outside that region (`bubble') the spacetime is matched
with the Minkowski spacetime. The interior of the bubble is consistent with the
effective field theory obtained from strings, with non-trivial tachyon-like and
antisymmetric tensor fields (in four dimensions the latter gives rise to an
axion pseudoscalar field). The tachyonic mode, however, does not represent the
standard flat-spacetime string tachyon, but merely expresses the instability of
the distorted spacetime. Due to the non-trivial matter content of the interior
of the bubble, there is entropy production, which expresses the fact that
information is carried away by the recoil degrees of freedom. We also
demonstrate that a particle can be captured by the bubble, depending on the
particle's impact parameter. This will result in information loss for an
external asymptotic observer, corresponding to production of entropy
propotional to the area of the bubble. For the validity of our approach it is
essential that the string length is a few orders of magnitude larger than the
Planck length, which is a typical situation encountered in many D-brane-world
models. A very interesting feature of our model is the emission of high-energy

on the level fluctuation statistics. We consider the case when the symmetry is
represented by a quantum number that takes one of two possible values, so that
the unperturbed system has a spectrum composed of two independent sequences.
When symmetry-breaking perturbation is represented by a random matrix with an
adjustable strength, the shape of the spectrum monotonously evolves towards the
Wigner distribution as the strength parameter increases. This contradicts the
observed behaviour of the acoustic resonance spectra in quartz blocks during
the breaking of a point-group symmetry that has two eigenvalues, where the
system changes in the beginning towards the Poisson statistics then turns back
to the GOE statistics. This behaviour is explained by assuming that the
symmetry breaking perturbation removes the degeneracy of a limited number of
levels, thus creating a third chaotic sequence. As symmetry breaking increases,
the new sequence grows at the expense of the initial pair until it overwhelms
the whole spectrum when the symmetry completely disappears. The calculated
spacing distribution and spectral rigidity are able to describe the evolution
of the observed acoustic resonance spectra.

extends high into the continuum, up to several thousand MeV. Calculations with

underway.

distribution of the P velocity structure in the mantle is determined using only
34 P- and 2 PcP-observed traveltimes. By applying a non-linear inversion, the
P-residuals in the range between 0 and 100 degrees are minimised up to a
maximum value of 0.015 s. Furthermore, from the high quality computation of PcP
traveltimes, with residuals much better than 0.13 s, it is possible to infer
the existence of a brief low velocity layer in the D"" region. This is then
followed by a gradual increasing in the velocity profile towards the core,
which begins at a depth of 2893.9 km.

properties of matter by expressing the inertial mass appearing in Newton's
second law of motion in terms of some other more fundamental interaction. One
increasingly popular approach explains inertial and gravitational forces as
drag forces arising due to quantum vacuum zero-point phenomena. General
relativity, however, suggests that gravitational and inertial forces are
manifestations of space-time geometry. Based on this, the present analysis
demonstrates that inertia and zero-point forces are ultimately relativistic in
origin. Additionally, it is argued that body forces induced on matter through
zero-point interactions are resistive forces acting in addition to inertia.

played by the concept of `world'. The view presented is that we are entitled to
use `many-worlds' terminology even if the theory does not specify the worlds in
the formalism; this is defended by means of an extensive analogy with the
concept of an `instant' or moment of time in relativity, with the lack of a
preferred foliation of spacetime being compared with the lack of a preferred
basis in quantum theory. Implications for identity of worlds over time, and for
relativistic quantum mechanics, are discussed.

spectrum of the infinite periodic system arises in the limit $N\to\infty$. We
illustrate the result on two kinds of examples. The first are serial graphs
obtained by chaining loops or T-junctions. A detailed discussion is presented
for a finite-periodic ""comb""; we show how the resonance poles can be computed
within the Krein formula approach. Another example concerns geometric
scatterers where the individual element consists of a surface with a pair of
leads; we show that apart of the resonances coming from the decoupled-surface
eigenvalues such scatterers exhibit the high-energy behavior typical for the
delta' interaction for the physically interesting couplings.
