display images of the spatial distribution of galaxies in the simulations that
illustrate its evolution and provide a qualitative understanding of the
processes responsible for various biases that develop. We consider three
specific statistical measures of clustering at z=1 and z=0: the correlation
length (in real- and redshift-space) of galaxies of different luminosity, the
morphology-density relation and the genus curve of the topology of galaxy
isodensity surfaces. For galaxies with luminosity below L*, the z=0 correlation
length depends very little on the luminosity of the sample, but for brighter
galaxies it increases very rapidly, reaching values in excess of 10Mpc/h. The
""accelerated"" dynamical evolution experienced by galaxies in rich clusters,
which is partly responsible for this effect, also results in a strong
morphology-density relation. Remarkably, this relation is already
well-established at z=1. The genus curves of the galaxies are significantly
different from the genus curves of the dark matter but this is not due to
genuine topological differences but rather to the sparse sampling of the
density field provided by galaxies. The predictions of our model at z=0 will be
tested by forthcoming data from the 2dF and Sloan galaxy surveys, and those at
z=1 by the DEEP and VIRMOS surveys.

have a larger multiple imaging cross section and significantly differ in the
image configuration. The external shear induced by a nearby galaxy, group or
cluster can affect image positions even for more widely separated lens pairs.
Both of these effects must be accounted for in lens modelling. We also show how
the presence of aligned discs in the pair of lensing galaxies can lead to very
large high-magnification cross sections. Multiple lens systems will be
important in future, both for constraining lens models of individual systems

collisionless dark matter can leave observable caustic rings in phase space and
this model is frequently used to make experimental predictions (Sikivie 1999).
Such cold collapses inevitably suffer from radial orbit instabilities that
produce unrealistic bar-like halos. Moreover, this model bears no relation to
the hierarchical growth of CDM galactic halos which form via a complicated
sequence of mergers and violent relaxation. This process destroys any symmetry
and phase wraps existing caustics on a scale comparable to the first objects to
collapse. Since axions can cluster on microscopic scales and free streaming of
neutralinos only erases structure smaller than \sim 100 (GeV/m_{CDM}) A.U., the
dynamical effects of caustics in the Galactic halo are expected to be

magnetic fields embedded in a stellar wind as the agent for collimation in
planetary nebulae. In these models the wind is assumed to be permeated by a
helical magnetic field in which the poloidal component falls off faster than
the toroidal component. The collimation only occurs after the wind is shocked
at large distances from the stellar source. In this paper we re-examine
assumptions built into this ``Magnetized Wind Blown Bubble'' (MWBB) model. We
show that a self-consistent study of the model leads to a large parameter
regime where the wind is self-collimated before the shock wave is encountered.
We also explore the relation between winds in the MWBB model and those which
are produced via magneto-centrifugal processes. We conclude that a more
detailed examination of the role of self-collimation is needed in the context

(1) The relative ages of binary star components are more similar than the

Only one of the companion masses is substellar, and hence the apparent
overabundance of T Tauri star companions relative to main-sequence star
companions can not be explained by a wealth of substellar secondaries that
would have been missed in main-sequence surveys. (3) Roughly 10% of T Tauri
binary star components have very red NIR colors (K-L > 1.4) and unusually high
mass accretion rates. This phenomenon does not appear to be restricted to
binary systems, however, since a comparable fraction of single T Tauri stars
exhibit the same properties. (4) Although the disk lifetimes of single stars
are roughly equal to their stellar ages, the disk lifetimes of binary stars are
an order of magnitude less than their ages. (5) The accretion rates for both
single and binary T Tauri stars appear to be moderately mass dependent. (6)
Although most classical T Tauri star binaries retain both a circumprimary and a
circumsecondary disk, there are several systems with only a circumprimary disk.
Together with the relative accretion rates, this suggests that circumprimary
disks survive longer, on average, than circumsecondary disks. (7) The disk
lifetimes, mass ratios, and relative accretion signatures of the closest
binaries (10-100 AU) suggest that they are being replenished from a
circumbinary reservoir with low angular momentum. Overall, these results
support fragmentation as the dominant binary star formation mechanism.

high iron abundance ($\sim$ 1). We suggest that this structure is either
another merging component or an internal structure of the main cluster. The
X-ray redshifts of several regions were measured. The results agree with the
optical ones and suggest that the main cluster, the subcluster and the

temperature ($\sim$ 4.5 keV) and high iron abundance ($\sim$ 0.6) in the

temperature jump was found across the edge, with higher temperature ahead of
the edge in the low density region. This phenomenon is qualitatively similar to
the ""cold fronts"" found in A2142 and A3667. If the ""shoulder"" is ignored, the
temperature map resembles those simulations at the early stage of merging while
the subcluster approached the main cluster from somewhere west. This fact and
the observed edge, in combination with the clear iron abundance contrast
between the center of the subcluster ($\sim$ 0.6) and the main cluster ($\sim$

Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). At variance with previous claims, we find that
these updated stellar models do experience thermal pulses in the AGB phase. In
particular we show that: a) in models with mass larger than 6 Mo, the second
dredge up is able to raise the CNO abundance in the envelope enough to allow a
""normal"" AGB evolution, in the sense that the thermal pulses and the third
dredge up settle on; b) in models of lower mass, the efficiency of the CNO
cycle in the H-burning shell is controlled by the carbon produced locally via
the 3alpha reactions. Nevertheless the He-burning shell becomes thermally
unstable after the early AGB. The expansion of the overlying layers induced by
these weak He-shell flashes is not sufficient by itself to allow a deep
penetration of the convective envelope. However, immediately after that, the
maximum luminosity of the He flash is attained and a convective shell
systematically forms at the base of the H-rich envelope. The innermost part of
this convective shell probably overlaps the underlying C-rich region left by
the inter-shell convection during the thermal pulse, so that fresh carbon is
dredged up in a ""hot"" H-rich environment and a H flash occurs. This flash
favours the expansion of the outermost layers already started by the weak
thermal pulse and a deeper penetration of the convective envelope takes place.
Then, the carbon abundance in the envelope rises to a level high enough that
the further evolution of these models closely resembles that of more metal rich
AGB stars. These stars provide an important source of primary carbon and
nitrogen.

shaping the descendant planetary nebula, by, among other things, slowing down

exsist, such that the relation between the total mass in the slow flow, M, and
the solid angle it covers, Omega, is given by (4*pi*M/Omega)>0.1Mo. The

the characteristic shock propagation time. The shock is assumed to move through
a uniformly magnetized, neutral plasma consisting of protons, electrons, and
positrons, and allowance is made for the possible production of
electron/positron pairs in the shock itself. The radiation mechanism is taken
to be synchrotron and inverse-Compton emission (the latter involving both
synchrotron-produced and externally supplied seed photons) by the electrons and
positrons. We simplify the discussion by considering a shock in which the
magnetic field is transverse to the direction of propagation and focus
attention on the properties of the radiative zone that forms behind the shock
transition. In particular, we investigate the possibility that the compression
induced by the cooling of the gas amplifies the magnetic pressure until it
reaches (and ultimately exceeds) equipartition with the thermal pressure
(which, in turn, limits the overall compression). We show that, if a
significant fraction of the postshock thermal energy is deposited in the
electron/positron component, then a considerable portion of the emitted
radiation will come from regions of strong magnetic field even if the field
immediately behind the shock transition is well below equipartition. This field
amplification mechanism may be relevant to the production of synchrotron flares
in blazars, miniquasars, and gamma-ray burst sources. We consider the latter
application in some detail and show that this process may play a role in the

height at the lower frequency is found to be more than that at the higher
frequency. The inferred heights range from ~160 km to ~1150 km. The set of
``active'' field lines, from which most of the conal radiation appears to
originate, are found to be confined to a region located within ~0.5 to ~0.6 of
the polar cap radius. We discuss the implications of our new findings on our

mechanisms.

and near IR data collected at ESO-La Silla. The spectroscopic data, spanning
the period from day -9 to day +376 (relative to B maximum), have shown that
this SN was unprecedented, although somewhat similar to SN1997ef. Maximum
expansion velocities as high as 3x10^4 km/s to some extent mask its resemblance
to other Type Ic SNe. At intermediate phases, between photospheric and fully
nebular, the expansion velocities (~10^4 km/s) remained exceptionally high
compared to those of other recorded core-collapse SNe at a similar phase. The
mild linear polarization detected at early epochs suggests the presence of
asymmetry in the emitting material. The degree of asymmetry, however, cannot be
decoded from these measurements alone. The HeI 1.083 mu and 2.058 mu lines are
identified and He is suggested to lie in an outer region of the envelope. The
temporal behavior of the fluxes and profiles of emission lines of MgI]4571A,

a very simple phenomenological model. We assume that an optically thin
flow/corona, emitting a power law like spectrum, is present at a range of
distances from the compact object. The slope of the locally emitted spectrum is
a function of distance with the hardest spectrum emitted in the innermost

to the inward propagation of perturbations on the diffusion time scales.

The mechanism is a dynamical Mossbauer-type recoil, in which the Hall momentum
of the tunneling electron is partly transferred to the whole electron system,
depending on the interrelation between the rate of interelectron momentum
exchange and the tunneling duration. We also show that, in a certain
temperature range, magnetic field can enhance rather than suppress the
tunneling rate. The effect is due to the magnetic field induced energy exchange
between the in-plane and out-of-plane motion. Magnetic field can also induce
switching between intra-well states from which the system tunnels, and a
transition from tunneling to thermal activation. Explicit results are obtained
for a Wigner crystal. They are in qualitative and quantitative agreement with

doped, weakly interacting N-leg Hubbard ladders. In this case, the Hubbard
ladders are equivalent to a N-band model. Using renormalization group
techniques, we find, that the half-filled ladders exhibit (in the spin-sector)
an odd-even effect only below a crossover energy E_{c}\propto exp[-a exp(c N)]
(a<<1 and c\sim 1), i.e., below E_{c}, the interactions take place only within
band pairs (j,N+1-j) [and within the band (N+1)/2 for N odd], such that
even-leg ladders are an insulating spin-liquid, while odd-leg ladders have one
gapless spinon-mode. In contrast, above the energy-scale E_{c}, all bands are
interacting with each other and the system is a 2D-like (insulating)
antiferromagnet; we obtain an analytical expression for the Hamiltonian which
is similar to the 2D Heisenberg antiferromagnet. Bosonization techniques show,
that the Mott insulator is as well below and above E_{c} of the same type as in
N/2 half-filled two-leg ladders; the charge-sector is therefore the same in 1D

doping is very similar to decreasing the number of legs N: In both cases
interactions between unpaired bands are suppressed and the antiferromagnetic
correlations are reduced. The resulting band pairs (j,N+1-j) are then
insulating spin-liquids and when doped, there is a spin-gap, but phase
coherence exists only within pairs of Fermi momenta (k_{Fj},pi-k_{Fj}) and
(pi-k_{Fj},k_{Fj}). At higher doping levels delta_{c}=delta_{c}(N), phase

Riemannian manifold. It has not to be valid for alternative geometrical
structures. In this article a general 3-parameter class of teleparallel models
is considered. The field equation turns out to have a form completely similar
to the Maxwell field equation $d*\F^a=\T^a$. By applying the Noether procedure,
the source 3-form $\T^a$ is shown to be connected with the diffeomorphism
invariance of the Lagrangian. Thus the source of the coframe field is
interpreted as the total conserved energy-momentum current of the system. A
reduction of the conserved current to the Noether current and the Noether
charge for the coframe field is provided. An energy-momentum tensor for the
coframe field is defined in a diffeomorphism invariant and a translational
covariant way. The total energy-momentum current of a system is conserved. Thus
a redistribution of the energy-momentum current between material and coframe

tensor is calculated for various teleparallel models: the pure Yang-Mills type

definition of some crucial effective radial functions, is shown to define a
dynamics with much improved post-Newtonian convergence properties, even for
black hole separations of the order of $6 GM / c^2$. We discuss the approximate
existence of a two-parameter family of ``spherical orbits'' (with constant
radius), and, of a corresponding one-parameter family of ``last stable
spherical orbits'' (LSSO). These orbits are of special interest for forthcoming
LIGO/VIRGO/GEO gravitational wave observations. It is argued that for most (but
not all) of the parameter space of two spinning holes the effective one-body
approach gives a reliable analytical tool for describing the dynamics of the
last orbits before coalescence. This tool predicts, in a quantitative way, how
certain spin orientations increase the binding energy of the LSSO. This leads
to a detection bias, in LIGO/VIRGO/GEO observations, favouring spinning black
hole systems, and makes it urgent to complete the conservative effective
one-body dynamics given here by adding (resummed) radiation reaction effects,
and by constructing gravitational waveform templates that include spin effects.
Finally, our approach predicts that the spin of the final hole formed by the
coalescence of two arbitrarily spinning holes never approaches extremality.

extracted from Data obtained with the HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW, which operates five
enriched 76Ge detectors in an extreme low-level environment in the GRAN SASSO.
The two neutrino accompanied double beta decay is evaluated for the first time
for all five detectors with a statistical significance of 47.7 kg y resulting
in a half life of (T_(1/2))^(2nu) = [1.55 +- 0.01 (stat) (+0.19) (-0.15)
(syst)] x 10^(21) years. The lower limit on the half-life of the 0nu beta-beta
decay obtained with pulse shape analysis is (T_(1/2))^(0_nu) > 1.9 x 10^(25)
[3.1 x 10^(25)] years with 90% C.L. (68% C.L.) (with 35.5 kg y). This results
in an upper limit of the effective Majorana neutrino mass of 0.35 eV (0.27 eV).
No evidence for a Majoron emitting decay mode or for the neutrinoless mode is
observed.

both model-independent and model-dependent supersymmetric parameter spaces is
discussed in detail. We find that values of tan\beta as low as 3 can be

smuon; however, we show that, somewhat surprisingly, no model-independent bound
can be placed on the mass of the lightest chargino for any tan\beta greater

anomalous magnetic moment are insensitive to CP-violating phases. We provide
analyses of the supersymmetric contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic
moment in dilaton-dominated supergravity models and gauge-mediated
supersymmetry-breaking models. Finally, we discuss how other phenomena, such as
$B(b\to s\gamma)$, relic abundance of the lightest superpartner, and the Higgs
mass may be correlated with the anomalous magnetic moment, but do not
significantly impact the viability of a supersymmetric explanation, or the mass

subject to the modeling constraint. The characteristics (energy and width) of

is acceptable, since these incomparable states cannot be transformed to each
