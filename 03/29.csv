amplitude at every scale depends uniquely on the CMB temperature correlation
function, $C(\theta)$, and thus the measured $\xi_\nu$ can be uniquely inverted
to obtain $C(\theta)$ and its Legendre transform, the power spectrum of the CMB

depositing a fair amount of momentum and kinetic energy over a notable volume
of its host dark cloud. This makes HH 300 a key player in the evolution and
fate of its parent cloud. The redshifted molecular outflow lobe of HH 300 is
1.1 pc long and 0.3 pc wide, and has a very clumpy structure. The density,
velocity, and momentum distributions in the outflow indicate that the observed
clumps arise from the prompt entrainment of ambient gas. Bow shock-shaped
structures are associated with the clumps, and we hypothesize that the shocks
are produced by different mass ejection episodes. Lines drawn from IRAS
04239+2436 to each of these clumps have different orientations on the plane of

assess the mean integrated output of X-rays in the 2-10 keV band from accreting
early-type binaries within 3 kpc of the Sun. Using a recent OB star census of
the Solar neighborhood, we then calculate the specific X-ray luminosity per O
star from accretion-powered systems. We also assess the contribution to the
total X-ray luminosity of an OB population from associated T Tauri stars,
stellar winds, and supernovae. We repeat this exercise for the major Local
Group galaxies, concluding that the total X-ray luminosity per O star spans a
broad range from 2 to 20e34 erg/s. Contrary to previous results, we do not find
a consistent trend with metallicity; in fact, the specific luminosities for M31

magnitude. In light of these results, we assess the fraction of the observed
2-10 keV emission from starburst galaxies that arises directly from their OB
star populations, concluding that, while binaries can explain most of the hard
X-ray emission in many local starbursts, a significant additional component or

damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems (DLAs) based on the disc galaxy formation model
which is developed by Mo, Mao & White. We propose that the DLAs are the central
galaxies of less massive dark haloes present at redshifts $z\sim 3$, and they
should inhabit haloes of moderately low circular velocity. The empirical
Schmidt law of star formation rates, and closed box model of chemical evolution
that an approximation known as instantaneous recycling is assumed, are adopted.
In our models, when the predicted distribution of metallicity for DLAs is
calculated, two cases are considered. One is that, using the closed box model,
empirical Schmidt law and star formation time, the distribution of metallicity
can be directly calculated. The other is that, when the simple gravitational
instability of a thin isothermal gas disc as first discussed by Toomre is
considered, the star formation occurs only in the region where the surface
density of gas satisfies the critical value, not everywhere of a gas disc. We
assume that star formation in each DLA lasts for a period of 1 Gyr from
redshifts $z=3$. There is only one output parameter in our models, i.e. the
stellar yield, which relates to the time of star formation history and is
obtained by normalizing the predicted distribution of metallicity to the mean
value of 1/13 $Z_{\odot}$ as presented by Pettini et al. The predicted
metallicity distribution is consistent with the current (rather limited)
observational data. A random distribution of galactic discs is taken into
account.

backward extrapolation of the trajectory of the type III bursts, tracing a

that QZ Nor and EV Sct are pulsating in the fundamental mode, whereas Polaris

identifications that rely on the comparison between direct and

find from our models that fundamental and first overtone pulsators attain, for

discrimination from this parameter difficult. The present mode identifications
for our sample of Cepheids are strengthened by the accuracy of their empirical

characteristic field scale $B_c$ determined by phase coherent paths which
encompass not only the wire, but also the two contacts. $B_c$ is essentially
temperature independent at low temperatures, indicating that the area of the
phase coherent paths is not determined by the superconducting coherence length
$L_T$ in the normal metal, which is strongly temperature dependent at low
temperatures. We identify the relevant length scale as a combination of the
electron phase coherence length $L_\phi$ in the normal metal and the coherence
length $\xi_S$ in the superconductor.

exactly solved by means of the equation of motion and Green's function
formalism. The exact solution of the t-J model has been also reported to
investigate the low-energy dynamics. We have successfully searched for the
exact eigenoperators, and the corresponding eigenenergies, having in mind the
possibility to use them as an operatorial basis on the lattice. Many local,
single-particle, thermodynamical and response properties have been studied as
functions of the external parameters and compared between the two models and
with some numerical and exact results. It has been shown that the 2-site
Hubbard model already contains the most relevant energy scales of the Hubbard
model: the local Coulomb interaction $U$ and the spin-exchange one
$J=\frac{4t^2}U$. As a consequence of this, for some relevant properties
(kinetic energy, double occupancy, energy, specific heat and entropy) and as
regards the metal-insulator transition issue, it has resulted possible to
almost exactly mime the behavior of larger systems, sometimes using a higher
temperature to get a comparable level spacing. The 2-site models have been also
used as toy models to test the efficiency of the Green's function formalism for
composite operators. The capability to reproduce the exact solutions, obtained
by the exact diagonalization technique, gives a firm ground to the approximate
treatments based on this formalism.

rules helps to simplify the subgoals that arise during a proof.
  LCF is an interactive theorem-prover intended for reasoning about

provides a family of rewriting functions, and operators to combine them. A
succession of functions is described, from pattern matching primitives to the
rewriting tool that performs most inferences in LCF proofs.
  The design is highly modular. Each function performs a basic, specific task,
such as recognizing a certain form of tautology. Each operator implements one
method of building a rewriting function from simpler ones. These pieces can be
put together in numerous ways, yielding a variety of rewrit- ing strategies.
  The approach involves programming with higher-order functions. Rewriting
functions are data values, produced by computation on other rewriting
functions. The code is in daily use at Cambridge, demonstrating the practical
use of functional programming.

scattering, which make their application quite unreliable. Many ""successes"" are
essentially based on an artificial freedom of parameters, which does not exist
when the models are constructed properly.
  The problem is the fact that any multiple scattering theory requires an
appropriate treatment of the energy sharing between the individual
interactions, which is technically very difficult to implement. Lacking a
satisfying solution to this problem, it has been simply ignored.
  We introduce a fully self-consistent formulation of the multiple-scattering
scheme. Inclusion of soft and hard components - very crucial at high energies -
appears in a ""natural way"", providing a smooth transition from soft to hard
physics.
  We can show that the effect of appropriately considering energy conservation
has a big influence on the results, and MUST therefore be included in any
serious calculation.

CFT-radiation term $(\rho_{CFT})$ from $M$ and the charged dust
$(-\rho^2_{cd})$ from $Q^2$ in the Friedmann-like equation.
  However, this equation is not justified because it contains
$\rho_{cd}^2$-term with the negative sign. This is unconventional in view of
the standard cosmology. In order to resolve this problem, we introduce a
localized dust matter which satisfies $P_{dm}=0$. If $\rho_{dm}=\fr{\sqrt
3}{2}\rho_{cd}$, the unwanted $-\rho_{cd}^2$ is cancelled against $\rho_{dm}^2$
and thus one recovers a standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe with
CFT-radiation and dust matter. For the stiff matter consideration, we can set
$\rho_{csti}\sim Q^2$ with the negative sign. Here we introduce a massless
scalar which plays the role of a stiff matter with $P_{sca}=\rho_{sca}$ to
cancel $-\rho_{csti}$. In this case, however, we find a mixed version of the
standard and brane cosmologies.

acting on a Hilbert space $H$ which either commute or anticommute, $U_iU_j=\pm
U_jU_i$ for all $i,j$; it is is called irreducible when $\{U_1,U_2,...\}$ is an
irreducible set of operators. There is a unique infinite matrix $(c_{ij})$ with
$0,1$ entries satisfying $$ U_iU_j=(-1)^{c_{ij}}U_jU_i, \qquad i,j=1,2,.... $$
Every matrix $(c_{ij})$ with $0,1$ entries satisfying $c_{ij}=c_{ji}$ and
$c_{ii}=0$ arises from a nontrivial irreducible spin system, and there are
uncountably many such matrices.
  Infinite dimensional irreducible representations exist when the commutation
matrix $(c_{ij})$ is of ""infinite rank"". In such cases we show that the
$C^*$-algebra generated by an irreducible spin system is the CAR algebra, an
infinite tensor product of copies of $M_2(\Bbb C)$, and we classify the
irreducible spin systems associated with a given matrix $(c_{ij})$ up to
approximate unitary equivalence. That follows from a structural result. The
$C^*$-algebra generated by the universal spin system $u_1,u_2,...$ of
$(c_{ij})$ decomposes into a tensor product $C(X)\otimes\Cal A$, where $X$ is a
Cantor set (possibly finite) and $\Cal A$ is either the CAR algebra or a finite
tensor product of copies of $M_2(\Bbb C)$.
  The Bratteli diagram technology of AF algebras is not well suited to spin
systems. Instead, we work out elementary properties of the $\Bbb Z_2$-valued
""symplectic"" form $$ \omega(x,y) =\sum_{p,q=1}^\infty c_{pq}x_qy_p, $$ $x,y$
ranging over the free infninite dimensional vector space over the Galois field
$\Bbb Z_2$, and show that one can read off the structure of $C(X)\otimes\Cal A$
from properties of $\omega$.

we measured Q_s=4.00(+0.83)(-1.06)eb. It corresponds to a smaller deformation
compared to the ground states of the W isotopes and is in disagreement with the
current theoretical predictions. We also measured the quadrupole moment of the
I=11- isomer in 196Pb, Q_s=(-)3.41(66)eb. It has the same proton s(-2)1/2 h9/2
i13/2 configuration as the one suggested for the I=16- magnetic bandhead which
allows to deduce the quadrupole moment of the 16- state as Q_s=-0.316(97)eb.
This small value proves the near sphericity of the bandhead.

of the phase diagram, where the gas of nuclear fragments coexists with the
infinite liquid condensate, is unambiguously identified. The peculiar
thermodynamic properties of the model near the boundary between the mixed phase

  deaquino@elo.com.br",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  In a previous work it was shown that the gravitational and inertial masses
are correlated by an adimensional factor, which depends on the incident
radiation upon the particle. It was also shown that there is a direct
correlation between the radiation absorbed by the particle and its
gravitational mass, independently of the inertial mass. This finding has
fundamental consequences to Unified Field Theory and Quantum Cosmology. Only in
the absence of electromagnetic radiation the mentioned factor becomes equal to
one. On the other hand, in specific electromagnetic conditions, it can be
reduced, nullified or made negative. This means that there is the possibility
of the gravitational masses can be reduced, nullified and made negative by
means of electromagnetic radiation. This unexpected theoretical result was
recently confirmed by an experiment (gr-qc/0005107). A fundamental consequence
of the mentioned correlation is that , in specific ultra-high energy
conditions, the gravitational and electromagnetic fields can be described by
the same Hamiltonian , i.e., in these circumstances, they are unified. Such
conditions can have occurred inclusive in the Initial Universe , before the
first spontaneous breaking of symmetry. Taking as base this discovery, and
starting from the gravitational mass of superparticles from the Initial
Universe we show here that it is possible to deduce the reciprocal fine
structure constant and the uncertainty principle directly from the Gravitation
Theory(Unified Theory).

unusual physical, rather than biological, mechanism, which yields an exact law.
The law agrees with all experimental data, but, contrary to existing theories,
it is the same for an entire species, i.e., it is independent of the
population, its phenotypes, environment and history. The law implies that the
survivability changes with environment via phase transitions, which are
simultaneous for all generations. They allow for a rapid (within few percent of
the life span) and significant increase in the life expectancy even above its
value at a much earlier age.

impose on deterministic and probabilistic conversion between multipartite
states via local actions and classical communication. These include
restrictions which do not follow from any bipartite considerations. We derive
supermultiplicativity relations between each state's monotones and the
monotones for collective processing when the parties share several states. We
also investigate polynomial invariants under local unitary transformations, and
show that a large class of these are invariant under collective unitary
processing and also multiplicative, putting restrictions, for example, on the
exact conversion of multiple copies of one state to multiple copies of another.
