the ROSAT Deep Survey (RDS) in the Lockman Hole. The UDS reaches a flux level
of 1.2 x 10E-15 erg/cm2/s in 0.5-2.0 keV energy band, a level ~4.6 times
fainter than the RDS. We present nearly complete spectroscopic identifications
(90%) of the sample of 94 X-ray sources based on low-resolution Keck spectra.
The majority of the sources (57) are broad emission line AGNs (type I), whereas
a further 13 AGNs show only narrow emission lines or broad Balmer emission
lines with a large Balmer decrement (type II AGNs) indicating significant
optical absorption. The second most abundant class of objects (10) are groups
and clusters of galaxies (~11%). Further we found five galactic stars and one
''normal'' emission line galaxy. Eight X-ray sources remain spectroscopically
unidentified. The photometric redshift determination indicates in three out of
the eight sources the presence of an obscured AGN in the range of 1.2 < z <
2.7. These objects could belong to the long-sought population of type 2 QSOs,
which are predicted by the AGN synthesis models of the X-ray background.
Finally, we discuss the optical and soft X-ray properties of the type I AGN,
type II AGN, and groups and clusters of galaxies, and the implications to the
X-ray backround.

Kennicutt criterion. This relates the onset of massive star formation to a
general gravitational instability of the gas disks of spiral galaxies. It is
often overlooked, however that such gravitational instabilities of the gas
disks have severe implications for the overall stability of the gas and star
disks of spiral galaxies. I show by numerical simulations of the evolution of a
combined gas and star disk that the violation of the stability condition
induces violent dynamical evolution of the combined system. In particular the
star disk heats up on time scales less than a Gyr to unrealistic high values of
the Toomre stability parameter Q. The morphologies of both the star and gas
disk resemble then no longer observed morphologies of spiral galaxies. Star
formation of stars on low velocity dispersion orbits would lead to dynamical
cooling of the disks to more realistic states. However, the required star
formation rate is extremely high.

region KR 140 using the SCUBA instrument on the JCMT. KR 140 is a small (5.7 pc
diameter) HII region at a distance of 2.3+/-0.3 kpc. Five of the six IRAS point
sources near KR 140 were mapped in this study. Our analysis shows that two of
these IRAS sources are embedded late B type stars lying well outside the HII
region, two are a part of the dust shell surrounding the HII region, and one is
the combined emission from an ensemble of smaller sources unresolved by IRAS.
We have discovered a number of relatively cold submillimeter sources not
visible in the IRAS data, ranging in size from 0.2 to 0.7 pc and in mass from
0.5 to 130 Msun. The distribution of masses for all sources is well
characterized by a power law N(>M) ~ M^{-alpha} with alpha = 0.5 +/- 0.04, in
agreement with the typical mass function for clumped structures of this scale
in molecular clouds. Several of the submillimeter sources are found at the
HII-molecular gas interface and have probably been formed as the result of the
expansion of the HII region. Many of the submillimeter sources we detect are
gravitationally bound and most of these follow a mass-size relationship
expected for objects in virial equilibrium with non-thermal pressure support.
Upon the loss of non-thermal support they could be sites of star formation.
Along with the two B stars that we have identified as possible cluster members
along with VES 735, we argue that five nearby highly-reddened stars are in a
pre-main-sequence stage of evolution.

parameters of the relativistic blastwave resulting from the explosion. We
present an analysis of {\em Chandra X-ray Observatory} observations of this

these data with ground-based optical and IR observations and fit the
synthesized afterglow lightcurve using models where collimated ejecta expand
into a surrounding medium. We find that we can explain the broadband lightcurve
with reasonable physical parameters only if the cooling is dominated by inverse
Compton scattering. Excess X-ray emission in the broadband spectrum indicates
that we are directly observing a contribution from inverse Compton scattering.
It is the first time this has been observed in a GRB afterglow, and it implies
that the GRB exploded in a reasonably dense (n~30 cm^{-3}) medium, consistent
with a diffuse interstellar cloud environment.

lowers their energetics by several orders of magnitude, and increases their
rate by the same factor. Therefore, it is likely that one out of 100 - 1000
core collapse supernovae generates ultra-relativistic jets, which beam
gamma-rays and all other early emission into two narrow cones. After a year, or
so, the jets are decelerated and become non-relativistic, and their emission
becomes more or less isotropic. At least two GRB: 970508 (z = 0.835) and 980703

symmetric, with a series of paired shock knots and bow shocks on either side of

VLA ammonia maps of the IRAS 05413-0104 molecular gas envelope in which the
protostellar jet source is embedded. We find that the envelope, with mass of
0.2 M(sun) detected by the interferometer, is flattened perpendicular to the
jet axis with a FWHM diameter of 12000 AU and an axis ratio of 2:1, as seen in
NH3 (1,1) emission. There is a velocity gradient of about 4-5 km sec^-1 pc^-1
across the flattened disk-like core, suggestive of rotation around an axis
aligned with the jet. Flux-weighted mean velocities increase smoothly with
radius with a roughly constant velocity gradient. In young (Class 0) systems
such as HH212, a significant amount of material is still distributed in a large
surrounding envelope, and thus the observable kinematics of the system may
reflect the less centrally condensed, youthful state of the source and
obscuration of central dynamics. The angular momentum of this envelope material
may be released from infalling gas through rotation in the HH212 jet, as recent
observations suggest (Davis et al. 2000). A blue-shifted wisp or bowl of
emitting gas appears to be swept up along the blue side of the outflow,
possibly lining the cavity of a wider angle wind around the more collimated
shock jet axis. Our ammonia (2,2)/(1,1) ratio map indicates that this very cold
core is heated to 14 Kelvin degrees in a centrally condensed area surrounding
the jet source. This edge-on core and jet system appears to be young and deeply
embedded. This environment, however, is apparently not disrupting the pristine
symmetry and collimation of the jet.

in an expanding universe predict that halos should form with a diverging inner
density profile, the cusp. There are some observational indications that the
dark matter distribution in galaxies might be characterized by a finite core.
This `core catastrophe' has prompted a search for alternatives to the CDM
cosmogony. It is shown here that the discrepancy between theory and
observations can be very naturally resolved within the standard CDM model,
provided that gas is not initially smoothly distributed in the dark matter
halo, but rather is concentrated in clumps of mass $\geq 0.01 %$ the total mass
of the system. Dynamical friction acting on these lumps moving in the
background of the dark matter particles, dissipates the clumps orbital energy
and deposits it in the dark matter. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, it is shown
that the dynamical friction provides a strong enough drag, and that with
realistic baryonic mass fractions, the available orbital energy of the clumps
is sufficient to heat the halo and turn the primordial cusp into a finite,
non-diverging core --- overcoming the competing effect of adiabatic contraction
due to gravitational influence of the shrinking baryonic component. Depending
on the initial conditions, the total density distribution may either become
more or less centrally concentrated. Possible consequences of the proposed
mechanism for other problems in the CDM model and for the formation and early
evolution of the baryonic component of galaxies are also briefly discussed.

X-ray selection allows us to explore properties of radio-loud quasars 10-100
weaker in the radio band than classical samples. The most convincing
interpretation of our results is that there are no radio-loud quasars whose
synchrotron emission peak reaches the EUV-soft X-ray band at these (radio) flux
levels. Moreover, due to the comparatively weak non-thermal emission, a
quasi-thermal component appears to contribute at optical-UV energies. The
detection of sources at low radio fluxes also reveals a large population of
steep spectrum quasars and the lack of the predicted turnover in the quasar
(radio) counts. The evolution of X-ray selected radio-loud quasars does not
significantly differ from that of radio-selected ones, and flat spectrum and
steep spectrum sources appear to behave quite similarly.

dust forms easily at the condensation temperature T_cond (about 2000 K), but
the dust will soon grow larger than the critical radius r_cr at the critical
temperature T_cr (about 1800 K). The large dust grains with r > r_cr will soon
segregate from the gas and precipitate below the photosphere. For this reason,
dust exists only in the limited region of T_cr < T < T_cond in the photo-
sphere which we referred to as an active dust zone, and this means that a cloud
layer is formed deep in the photosphere rather than in the cooler surface
region. With the simple assumption that only small dust grains (r < r_cr) can
be sustained in the photosphere, a self- consistent non-grey model photosphere
in radiative-convective equilibrium can be developed without any other ad-hoc
assumption. We show that the spectra and colours of L (the cloud layer appears
in the optically thin region) and T (the dust cloud is situated too deep to be
observable) dwarfs can consistently be reproduced by a single grid of our

naturally new distributions. Finally, as a working example of the approach to

suited for angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) but also they
offer a rich ground for studying key concepts for the emerging paradigm of
non-Fermi liquid (non-FL) physics. In this article, we discuss the ARPES
technique applied to three quasi-low-D inorganic metals: a paradigm Fermi
liquid (FL) material TiTe$_{2}$, a well-known quasi-1D charge density wave
(CDW) material K$_{0.3}$MoO$_{3}$ and a quasi-1D non-CDW material
Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_{6}$O$_{17}$. With TiTe$_2$, we establish that a many body
theoretical interpretation of the ARPES line shape is possible. We also address
the fundamental question of how to accurately determine the {\bf k}$_F$ value
from ARPES. Both K$_{0.3}$MoO$_{3}$ and Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_{6}$O$_{17}$ show
quasi-1D electronic structures with non-FL line shapes. A CDW gap opening is
observed for K$_{0.3}$MoO$_{3}$, whereas no gap is observed for
Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_{6}$O$_{17}$. We show, however, that the standard CDW theory,
even with strong fluctuations, is not sufficient to describe the non-FL line
shapes of K$_{0.3}$MoO$_{3}$. We argue that a Luttinger liquid (LL) model is
relevant for both bronzes, but also point out difficulties encountered in
comparing data with theory. We interpret this situation to mean that a more
complete and realistic theory is necessary to understand these data.

and c-axis of both superconducting and antiferromagnetic phases of electron
doped Nd$_{1.85}$Ce$_{.15}$CuO$_{4+\delta}$. The results are compared to
characteristic features of the electromagnetic response in hole doped cuprates.
Within the CuO$_2$ planes the frequency dependent scattering rate,
1/$\tau(\omega)$, is depressed below $\sim$ 650 cm$^{-1}$; this behavior is a
hallmark of the pseudogap state. While in several hole doped compounds the
energy scales associated with the pseudogap and superconducting states are
quite close, we are able to show that in Nd$_{1.85}$Ce$_{.15}$CuO$_{4+\delta}$
the two scales differ by more than one order of magnitude. Another feature of
the in-plane charge response is a peak in the real part of the conductivity,
$\sigma_1(\omega)$, at 50-110 cm$^{-1}$ which is in sharp contrast with the
Drude-like response where $\sigma_1(\omega)$ is centered at $\omega=0$. This
latter effect is similar to what is found in disordered hole doped cuprates and
is discussed in the context of carrier localization. Examination of the c-axis
conductivity gives evidence for an anomalously broad frequency range from which
the interlayer superfluid is accumulated. Compelling evidence for the pseudogap
state as well as other characteristics of the charge dynamics in
Nd$_{1.85}$Ce$_{.15}$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ signal global similarities of the cuprate

renormalized by the interaction in the LL leads. In comparison with the system
with Fermi liquid (FL) leads, the current is suppressed, consistent with the
suppression of the electron tunneling density of states of the LL; and the
outset of the resonant tunneling is shifted to higher bias voltages. Besides,
the linear conductance obtained by Furusaki using master equation can be
reproduced from our result.

should be no static friction for two weakly interacting flat atomically smooth
clean solid surfaces. The absence of static friction results from the fact that
the atomic level interfacial potential energy is much weaker than the elastic
potential energy, which prevents the atoms from sinking to their interfacial
potential minima. Consequently, we have essentially two rigid solids, for which
the forces at randomly distributed ""pinning sites"" cancel. It is shown here
that even fluctuations in the concentration of atomic level defects at the
interface do not account for static friction. It is also argued that the
sliding of contacting asperities, which occurs when the problem is studied at
the multi-micron length scale, relative to each other involves the shearing of
planes of atoms. Since this results in a force for the interaction of two
asperities which varies over sliding distances of the order of an atomic
spacing, the contacting asperities at the surface are able to sink to their
interfacial potential minima, with negligible cost in elastic potential energy.
This results in static friction.

treating it as inhomogeneous composite material, containing the dielectric and
metallic stripe-like nanoparticles. The formalism of effective medium theory is
then applied for calculation of dielectric permittivity, optical and EELS
spectra of $La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_4$ with $x$ varying in a wide range. Reasonable
semi-quantitative agreement with experiment has been obtained even for the
simplest version of the theory. The model was found able to reproduce all
essential features of optical conductivity $\sigma(\omega)$ and transmittance
both for thin films (M. Suzuki, Phys. Rev. B 39, 2321 (1989)) and bulk
single-crystalline samples (S. Uchida {\it et al.} Phys. Rev. B 43, 7942

absorption for the thin-film and bulk samples is easily explained if only to
assume different shape of metallic and dielectric regions in both materials.
New peaks in optical conductivity and absorption spectra, that emerge in the
midinfrared range near 0.5 and 1.5 eV upon doping are attributed to geometrical
(Mie's) resonances. Overall, we point out that all main peculiarities of the
doping effect on optical and EELS spectra for cuprates including the spectral
changes accompanying the insulator-to-metal transition can be explained rather
prosaically by recognizing that the doping results in emergence of nanoscopic
metallic stripe-like droplets.

made on lattices with temporal size $N_t=4$ and 6, using an RG-improved action
for the gluon sector and a meanfield-improved clover action for the quark
sector. The lines of constant physics corresponding to fixed values of the
ratio $m_{\rm PS}/m_{\rm V}$ of the pseudo-scalar to vector meson masses at
zero temperature are determined, and the beta functions which describe the
renormalization-group flow along these lines are calculated. Using these
results, the energy density and the pressure are calculated as functions of
temperature along the lines of constant physics in the range $m_{\rm PS}/m_{\rm

D64 (2001) 065023","10.1103/PhysRevD.64.065023",,"hep-ph hep-th",,"  The conventional supersymmetric grand unified theories suffer from two
serious problems, the large mass splitting between doublet and triplet Higgs
multiplets, and the too long lifetime of the proton. A unification model based
on a semi-simple group SU(5)_{GUT} \times U(3)_H has been proposed to solve
both of the problems simultaneously. Although the proposed model is perfectly
consistent with observations, there are various mysteries. In this paper, we
show that such mysterious features in the original model are naturally
explained by embedding the model into the brane world in a higher dimensional
space-time. In particular, the relatively small gauge coupling constant of the
SU(5)_{GUT} at the unification energy scale is a consequence of relatively
large volume of extra dimensions. Here, we put the SU(5)_{GUT} gauge multiplet
in a 6-dimensional bulk and assume all fields in the U(3)_H sector to reside on
a 3-dimensional brane located in the bulk. On the other hand, all chiral
multiplets of quarks, leptons and Higgs are assumed to reside on a 3-brane at a
T^2/Z_4 orbifold fixed point. The quasi-N=2 supersymmetry in the hypercolor
U(3)_H sector is understood as a low-energy remnant of the N=4 supersymmetry in
a 6-dimensional space-time. We further extend the 6-dimensional model to a
10-dimensional theory. Possible frameworks of string theories are also
investigated to accommodate the present brane-world model. We find that the
type IIB string theory with D3-D7 brane structure is an interesting candidate.

generalization of conformal invariance to the anisotropic scaling {\em at} the

this filtering causes the wavenumber spectrum of the translational kinetic
energy for the NS-alpha model to roll off as k^{-3} for k \alpha > 1 in three
dimensions, instead of continuing along the slower Kolmogorov scaling law,
k^{-5/3}, that it follows for k \alpha < 1. This rolloff at higher wavenumbers
shortens the inertial range for the NS-alpha model and thereby makes it more
computable. We also explain how the NS-alpha model is related to large eddy

we show that the number of degrees of freedom in the long-time behavior of the
solutions to these equations is bounded from above by (L/\ell_{epsilon})^3,
where L is a typical large spatial scale (e.g., the size of the domain). This
estimate suggests that the Landau-Lifshitz classical theory of turbulence is
suitable for interpreting the solutions of the NS-alpha equations. Hence, one
may consider these equations as a closure model for the Reynolds averaged
Navier-Stokes equations (NSE). We study this approach, further, in other
related papers. Finally, we discuss the relation of the NS-alpha model to the
NSE by proving a convergence theorem, that as the length scale alpha tends to
zero a subsequence of solutions of the NS-alpha equations converges to a weak
solution of the three dimensional NSE.

  Proceedings: Quantum Vortex Dynamics, August 2000, Cambridge University",,,,"nlin.CD",,"  We review the Hall-Vinen-Bekarevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) equations for
superfluid Helium turbulence and discuss their implications for recent
measurements of superfluid turbulence decay.
  A new Hamiltonian formulation of these equations renormalizes the vortex line
velocity to incorporate finite temperature effects. These effects also
renormalize the coupling constant in the mutual friction force between the
superfluid and normal fluid components by a factor of rho_s / \rho (the
superfluid mass fraction) but they leave the vortex line tension unaffected.
Thus, the original HVBK form is recovered at zero temperature and its mutual
friction coefficients are renormalized at nonzero temperature. The HVBK
equations keep their form and no new parameters are added. However, a
temperature dependent trade-off does arise between the mutual friction coupling
and the vortex line tension.
  The renormalized HVBK equations obtained via this new Hamiltonian approach
imply a dynamical equation for the space-integrated vortex tangle length, which
is the quantity measured by second sound attenuation experiments in superfluid
turbulence. A Taylor-Proudman theorem also emerges for the superfluid vortices
that shows the steady vortex line velocity becomes columnar under rapid
rotation.

geometrically either as objects in a vector space, or as coset spaces of Lie
symmetry groups with respect to subgroups that leave these objects invariant.
Examples include liquid crystals, superfluids, Yang-Mills magnetofluids and

defects may move relative to the Lagrangian fluid material and thereby produce

the Hamiltonian in the maximum principle is given by the pairing of the
Eulerian impulse density with the velocity. We provide a comparative discussion
of the flow equations in their Eulerian and Lagrangian form and describe how
these forms occur naturally in the context of optimal control. We demonstrate
that the extremal equations corresponding to the optimal control problem for

amplitudes show a strong variation with momentum. This description allows to
determine in-medium cross sections beyond the quasi-particle approximation
accounting thereby for the finite width which nucleons acquire in the dense

either one of two different wave functions predicting specific values for

regarding mutually exclusive features of a physical existent. It is important
to ask whether people have the capacity to make observations of mutually
exclusive phenomena. Our everyday experience informs us that a human observer
is capable of observing only one set of physical circumstances at a time.
Evidence from psychology, though, indicates that people may have the capacity
to make observations of mutually exclusive physical phenomena, even though this
capacity is not generally recognized. Working independently, Sigmund Freud and

quantum dots, spin systems, quantum computers etc., can be considered as
``chaotic'' superpositions of mean-field basis states (Slater determinants,
products of spin or qubit states). This is due to a very high level density of
many-body states that are easily mixed by a residual interaction between
particles (quasi-particles). For such systems, we have derived simple
analytical expressions for the time dependence of energy width of wave packets,
as well as for the entropy, number of principal basis components and inverse
participation ratio, and tested them in numerical experiments. It is shown that
the energy width $\Delta (t)$ increases linearly and very quickly saturates.
The entropy of a system increases quadratically, $S(t) \sim t^2$ at small
times, and after, can grow linearly, $S(t) \sim t$, before the saturation.
Correspondingly, the number of principal components determined by the entropy,
$N_{pc} \sim exp{(S(t))}$, or by the inverse participation ratio, increases
exponentially fast before the saturation. These results are explained in terms
of a cascade model which describes the flow of excitation in the Fock space of
basis components. Finally, a striking phenomenon of damped oscillations in the
Fock space at the transition to an equilibrium is discussed.

of unequal oscillator strengths of the transitions is considered. Durations of
the probe pulse and the coupling pulse $T_{1,2}$ ($T_2>T_1$) are assumed to be
shorter than any of the relevant atomic relaxation times. We propose analytical
and numerical solutions of a self-consistent set of coupled Schr\""{o}dinger
equations and reduced wave equations in the adiabatic limit with the account of
the first non-adiabatic correction. The adiabaticity criterion is also
discussed with the account of the pulse propagation. The dynamics of
propagation is found to be strongly dependent on the ratio of the transition
oscillator strengths. It is shown that envelopes of the pulses slightly change
throughout the medium length at the initial stage of propagation. This distance
can be large compared to the one-photon resonant absorption length. Eventually,
the probe pulse is completely reemitted into the coupling pulse during
propagation. The effect of localization of the atomic coherence has been
observed similar to the one predicted by Fleischhauer and Lukin (PRL, {\bf 84},
