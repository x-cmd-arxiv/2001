(L43), K44 (L68) and L116, which are clusters projected onto the outer parts of
the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The photometry was carried out in the
Washington system $C$ and $T_1$ filters allowing the determination of ages by
means of the magnitude difference between the red giant clump and the main
sequence turnoff, and metallicities from the red giant branch locus. The
clusters have ages in the range 2-6 Gyr, and metallicities between $-1.65<$
[Fe/H] $<-1.10$, increasing the sample of intermediate-age clusters in the SMC.
L116, the outermost cluster projected onto the SMC, is a foreground cluster,
and somewhat closer to us than the Large Magellanic Cloud. Our results,
combined with those for other clusters in the literature, show epochs of sudden
chemical enrichment in the age-metallicity plane, which favour a bursting star
formation history as opposede to a continuous one for the SMC.

halo-like emission is detected from the center of the cluster at both

emission from previously known point sources. In addition to the halo and at a
much lower level, outlying steep-spectrum emission regions straddle the cluster
center and are seen only at 74 MHz. The location, morphology and spectrum of
this emission are all highly suggestive of at least one, and possibly two
cluster radio relics. Easily obtained higher resolution, higher sensitivity VLA
observations at both frequencies are required to confirm the extended nature of
the halo-like emission and the 74 MHz relic detections. However, since there is
prior evidence that this cluster is or has recently been in the process of a
major merger event, the possible discovery of relics in this system is of great
interest in light of recent observational and theoretical evidence in favor of
a merger-relic connection. We discuss the possible role the merger shock waves,
which are seen in the X-ray emission, may have played in the formation of the
halo and radio relics in A754.

the cosmological parameters Omega_m and Omega_lambda. The existence of a
multiple image system with known redshift allows, for a given (Omega_m,
Omega_lambda) cosmology, absolute calibration of the total mass deduced from
lens modelling. Recent Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of galaxy
clusters reveal a large number of multiple images, which are predicted to be at
different redshifts. If it is possible to measure spectroscopically the
redshifts of many multiple images then one can in principle constrain
(Omega_m,Omega_lambda) through ratios of angular diameter distances,
independently of any external assumptions. For a regular/relaxed cluster
observed by HST with 3 multiple image systems, each with different
spectroscopic redshifts, we show by analytic calculation that the following
uncertainties can be expected: Omega_m=0.30 +/- 0.11, Omega_lambda=0.70 +/-
0.23 or Omega_m=1.00 +/- 0.17, Omega_lambda=0.00 +/- 0.48 for the two most
popular world models. Numerical tests on simulated data confirm these good
constraints, even in the case of more realistic cluster potentials, such as
bimodal clusters, or when including perturbations by galaxies. To investigate
the sensitivity of the method to different mass profiles, we also use an
analytic ``pseudo-elliptical'' Navarro, Frenk & White profile in the
simulations. These constraints can be improved if more than 3 multiple images
with spectroscopic redshifts are observed, or by combining the results from
different clusters. Some prospects on the determination of the cosmological
parameters with gravitational lensing are given.

  We derive an astonishingly low Specific Frequency for NGC 1316 of only
Sn=0.9, which confirms with a larger field a previous finding by Grillmair et
al. (1999). Assuming a ""normal"" Sn of ~4 for early-type galaxies, we use
stellar population synthesis models to estimate in 2 Gyr the age of this
galaxy, if an intermediate-age population were to explain the low Sn we
observe. This value agrees with the luminosity-weighted mean age of NGC 1316
derived by Kuntschner & Davies (1998) and Mackie & Fabbiano (1998).

and uses a recursively refined Cartesian grid to solve Poisson's equation for
the potential, rather than obtaining the potential from a Green's function.
Refinements can have arbitrary shapes and in practice closely follow the
complex morphology of the density field that evolves. The timestep shortens by
a factor two with each successive refinement. It is argued that an appropriate
choice of softening length is of great importance and that the softening should
be at all points an appropriate multiple of the local inter-particle
separation. Unlike tree and P3M codes, multigrid codes automatically satisfy
this requirement. We show that at early times and low densities in cosmological
simulations, the softening needs to be significantly smaller relative to the
inter-particle separation than in virialized regions. Tests of the ability of
the code's Poisson solver to recover the gravitational fields of both
virialized halos and Zel'dovich waves are presented, as are tests of the code's
ability to reproduce analytic solutions for plane-wave evolution. The times
required to conduct a LCDM cosmological simulation for various configurations

different wavelengths in this spectral regime can probe different thin slices
of the early universe. The anisotropy noise contributed by continuum radiation
from foreground far--infrared sources could be taken out by subtracting maps at

distributions of the line-of-sight velocities at different distances from the

wave spiral pattern are determined: the corotation radius, the amplitudes and
phases of the gas velocity perturbations at different radii, and the velocity
of circular rotation of the disk corrected for the velocity perturbations due
to spiral arms. At a high confidence level, the presence of the two giant
anticyclones in the reference frame rotating with the spiral pattern is shown;
their sizes and the localization of their centers are consistent with the
results of the analytic theory and of numerical simulations. Besides the
anticyclones, the existence of cyclones in residual velocity fields of spiral

an elementary optical light- matter interaction provides one which is commonly
observed in the labs, but with a distortion due to the use of short, powerful
laser pulses. It is generally assumed that Raman scattering in gases is
incoherent. This assumption fails if the pressure is lowered enough to increase
the relaxation times over the length of light pulses; the ''Impulsive
Stimulated Raman Scattering'' (ISRS), generally used to study dense matter with
ultrashort laser pulses, is adapted to the low energy pulses making the
incoherent light beams; the usual light is redshifted by some very low pressure
gases while it propagates.
  To produce this adapted ISRS called ''Incoherent Light Spatially Coherent
Raman Scattering"" (ILSCRS), a molecule must have an hyperfine structure:
polyatomic molecules must be heavy or have odd numbers of electrons; light
atoms and the other molecules must be perturbed by a Stark or Zeeman effect.
  ILSCRS redshifts may be distinguished from Doppler redshifts using a very
difficult to observe dispersion of ILSCRS redshifts. This dispersion may
explain the discrepancies of the fine structures in the spectra of the quasars,
presently attributed to a variation of the fine structure constant.
  While the present interpretation of the Lyman forest in the spectra of
quasars requires clouds stressed, for instance, by sheets of dark matter,
ILSCRS interpretation requires only usual physical concepts. It produces
thermal radiations from short wavelengths, just as dust.

For adequately low mass overflow rates from the companion star long outburst
recurrence times are expected. But the fact that we find predominantly long
recurrence times or that only one X-ray nova outburst was detected at all poses
a problem. The question arises whether any braking mechanism could act in a way
that long recurrence times are favored. We suggest that a circumbinary disk
exists and brakes the orbital motion of the binary stars by tidal interaction.
The irradiation during an outburst leads to mass loss by winds from the
circumbinary disk, releaving the braking force until the removed matter is
refilled by diffusion from outer parts. We show that this reduction of braking
will self-adjust the mass transfer to the marginal rate that gives long
recurrence times.

are in the range [Fe/H] = -1.09 to -1.78 (or -0.95 to -1.58, adopting a

very metal rich limit of all RRd's for which metal abundance has been
estimated, either by direct measure (for field objects) or on the basis of the
hosting system (for objects in globular clusters or external galaxies). These
metal abundances, coupled with mass determinations from pulsational models and
the Petersen diagram, are used to compare the mass-metallicity distribution of
field and cluster RR Lyrae variables. We find that field and cluster RRd's seem
to follow the same mass-metallicity distribution, within the observational
errors, strengthening the case for uniformity of properties between field and
cluster variables At odds to what is usually assumed, we find no significative
difference in mass for RR Lyrae's in globular clusters of different metallicity
and Oosterhoff types, or there may even be a difference contrary to the
commonly accepted one, depending on the metallicity scale adopted to derive
masses. This ``unusual'' result for the mass-metallicity relation is probably
due, at least in part, to the inclusion of updated opacity tables in the
computation of metal-dependent pulsation models.

for porosity evolution have remained a mystery . Here we show by experiment,
lattice computer simulation, and a continuum model, that nanoporosity is due to
an intrinsic dynamical pattern formation process - pores form because the more
noble atoms are chemically driven to aggregate into two-dimensional clusters
via a spinodal decomposition process at the solid-electrolyte interface. At the
same time, the surface area continuously increases due to etching. Together,
these processes evolve a characteristic length scale predicted by our continuum
model. The applications potential of nanoporous metals is enormous. For
instance, the high surface area of nanoporous gold made by dealloying Ag-Au can
be chemically tailored, making it suitable for sensor applications,
particularly in biomaterials contexts.

photons $(k_1; k_2)$ participate, is considered. In relation to one-photon
processes, these processes are of the second order on $\alpha$, if the wave
intensity $\xi \ll 1$ (i.e., actually absorption from the wave only one
quantum). Otherwise, they are competing and essentially nonlinear. One-photon
processes have a number of the important physical applications. For example,
${\gamma}e$ and ${\gamma}{\gamma}$ colliders work on their basis.
  In DSB the calculation is conducted at the level of reaction amplitudes. It
essentially simplifies both the calculation and the form of obtained results;
those combinations of amplitudes which describe the spin effects are easy to
calculate. And these effects are especially essential in nonlinear processes.
The calculations are conducted in covariant form. Besides compactness, this
provides independence of the frames of reference and energy modes. The masses
of fermions are taken into account precisely and are not assumed equal each
other (heavy leptons, modes of various decays). The pattern of calculation is
given in the channel indicated in the title. The amplitudes of this channel are
also applicable for calculating of induced decay of orthopositronium into two
photons. And in this approach there is no necessity to assume the relative
momentum equal to zero.

Cabibbo angle, this angle is directly shown to scale like $\mu_1/m_s \pm
\mu_2/m_c$, where $|\mu_1| \ll m_s, |\mu_2| \ll m_c$ are independent mass
scales. For $n=3$ generations, we extend to the Yukawa matrices of $u$- and
$d$-type quarks the property that the $2\times 2$ upper-left sub-matrix of the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix $K$ is a good approximation to the Cabibbo
matrix $C$. Then, without any additional Ansatz concerning the existence of
mass hierarchies or the smallness of the mixing angles, the moduli of its

$[\beta_{13},\beta_{23},\beta_{31},\beta_{32}] \sqrt{{m_c}/{m_t}} \pm

asymptotic behaviour in the case of three generations can also be strengthened

  The basic lesson is that one Fourier mode (namely the zero mode) can be
decisive for even the ground state mass. The choice of boundary conditions is
seen to be not important, if and only if all degrees of freedom are treated
properly. This is still a problem for light-cone quantization in general.

states. At the bottom of this hierarchy are the partial density of states for
which represent the contribution to the local density of states if both the
incident and outgoing scattering channel are prescribed. On the next higher
level is the injectivity which represents the contribution to the local density
of states if only the incident channel is prescribed regardless of the final
scattering channel. The injectivity is related by reciprocity to the emissivity
of a point into a quantum channel. The sum of all partial density of states or
the sum of all injectivities or the sum of all emissivities is equal to the
local density of states. The use of the partial density of states is
illustrated for a number of different electron transport problems in mesoscopic
physics: The transmission from a tunneling tip into a mesoscopic conductor, the
discussion of inelastic or phase breaking scattering with a voltage probe, and
the ac-conductance of mesoscopic conductors. The transition from a capacitive
response (positive time-delay) to an inductive response (negative time-delay)
for a quantum point contact is used to illustrate the difficulty in associating
time-scales with a linear response analysis. A brief discussion of the
off-diagonal elements of a partial density of states matrix is presented. The
off-diagonal elements permit to investigate carrier fluctuations away from the
average carrier density. The work concludes with a discussion of the relation
between the partial density of states matrix and the Wigner-Smith delay time
matrix.
