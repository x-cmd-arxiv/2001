close to a blackbody at the star effective temperature and exhibit a
distinctive absorption feature at the proton cyclotron energy $E_{c,p}\simeq
0.63 (B/10^{14} {\rm G})$ keV. The proton cyclotron features (PCFs) are
conspicuous (equivalent width of up to many hundreds eV) and relatively broad
($\Delta E/E \sim 0.05-0.2$). The detection of the PCFs is well within the
capabilities of present X-ray spectrometers, like the HETGS and METGS on board

on one side or on both sides by a given spectrum. This code has been presented

Presently the code solves the transfer of the continuum with the Accelerated
Lambda Iteration method (ALI) and that of the lines in a two stream Eddington
approximation, without using the local escape probability formalism to
approximate the line transfer. This transfer code is coupled with a Monte Carlo
code which allows to take into account direct and inverse Compton diffusions,
and to compute the spectrum emitted up to MeV energies, in any geometry. The
influence of a few physical parameters is shown, and the importance of the
density and pressure distribution (constant density, pressure equilibrium, or
hydrostatic equilibrium) is stressed. Recent improvements in the treatment of
the atomic data are described, and foreseen developments are mentioned.

cosmic explosions. Their light curves suggest that the gamma-ray emission
occurs at early stages of the ejecta expansion, well before it decelerates in
the ambient medium. If so, the launched gamma-ray front must overtake the
ejecta and sweep the ambient medium outward. As a result a gap is opened
between the ejecta and the medium that surfs the radiation front ahead.
Effectively, the ejecta moves in a cavity until it reaches a radius
R_{gap}=10^{16}E_{54}^{1/2} cm where E is the isotropic energy of the GRB. At
R=R_{gap} the gap is closed, a blast wave forms and collects the medium swept
by radiation. Further development of the blast wave is strongly affected by the
leading radiation front: the front plays the role of a precursor where the
medium is loaded with e+- pairs and preaccelerated just ahead of the blast. It
impacts the emission from the blast at R < R_{load}=5R_{gap} (the early
afterglow). A spectacular observational effect results: GRB afterglows should
start in optical/UV and evolve fast (< min) to a normal X-ray afterglow. The
early optical emission observed in GRB 990123 may be explained in this way. The
impact of the front is especially strong if the ambient medium is a wind from a
massive progenitor of the GRB. In this case three phenomena are predicted: (1)
The ejecta decelerates at R<R_{load} producing a lot of soft radiation. (2) The
light curve of soft emission peaks at
t_{peak}=40(1+z)E_{54}^{1/2}(Gamma_{ej}/100)^{-2} s where Gamma_{ej} is the
Lorentz factor of the ejecta. Given measured redshift z and t_{peak}, one finds
Gamma_{ej}. (3) The GRB acquires a spectral break at 5 - 50 MeV because harder
photons are absorbed by radiation scattered in the wind.

function of the 1.7 day binary phase using a 6.4 day observation with the Rossi

lasting nearly an entire orbit, is followed by a return to previous flux
levels. This behavior occurs twice, at nearly the same binary phase, but it is
not present in consecutive orbits. When the X-ray flux is at lower intensity, a
periodic amplitude modulation of 7% is evident in data folded modulo the
orbital period. The higher intensity data show weaker correlation with phase.
This is the first report of X-ray variability at the orbital period of LMC X-3.
Archival RXTE observations of LMC X--3 during a high flux state in December
1996 show similar phase dependence. An ultraviolet light curve obtained with
the High Speed Photometer aboard the Hubble Space Telescope shows orbital
modulation consistent with that in the optical, caused by the ellipsoidal
variation of the spatially deformed companion.

planets promise to tell us much about the nature of these systems. We examine
how atmospheric lensing and (projected) planet oblateness/ellipticity modify
transit light curves. The large density gradients expected in planet
atmospheres can offset the unfavorably large observer-lens to source-lens
distance ratio, and allow the existence of caustics. Under such conditions,
starlight from all points in the planet's shadow is refracted into view
producing a characteristic slowing down of the dimming at ingress (vice versa
for egress). A search over several parameters, the planet radius etc., cannot
produce a nonlensed transit light curve that can mimic a lensed light curve.
The fractional change in the diminution of starlight is approximately the ratio
of atmospheric scale height to planet radius, expected to be 1 % or less.
Planet oblateness induces an asymmetry to the transit light curve about the
point of minimum flux, depending on the planet orientation. The fractional
asymmetry is around 0.5 % for a projected ellipticity of 10 %, independent of
lensing. For favorable ratios of planet to star radius, the above effects are
potentially observable with future space-based missions. This will allow us to
constrain the planet shape, and its atmospheric scale height, density and
refractive coefficient, providing information on its rotation, temperature and
composition. For HD 209458b, the only currently known transiting extrasolar
planet, caustics are absent because of the very small lens-source separation.
Finally, we provide estimates of other variations to transit light curves that
could be of comparable importance, including rings, satellites, stellar
oscillations, star spots, and weather.

angular momentum and energy from the disk. Two main regimes have been
discussed, {\it hydromagnetic outflows}, which have a significant mass flux and
have energy and angular momentum carried by both the matter and the
electromagnetic field and, Poynting outflows, where the mass flux is negligible
and energy and angular momentum are carried predominantly by the
electromagnetic field. Here we consider a Keplerian disk initially threaded by
a dipole-like magnetic field and we present solutions of the force-free
Grad-Shafranov equation for the coronal plasma. We find solutions with Poynting
jets where there is a continuous outflow of energy and toroidal magnetic flux
from the disk into the external space. This behavior contradicts the commonly
accepted ``theorem'' of Solar plasma physics that the motion of the footpoints
of a magnetic loop structure leads to a stationary magnetic field configuration
with zero power and flux outflows.
  In addition we discuss recent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations which
establish that quasi-stationary collimated Poynting jets similar to our
Grad-Shafranov solutions arise from the inner part of a disk threaded by a
dipole-like magnetic field. At the same time we find that there is a steady
uncollimated hydromagnetic outflow from the outer part of the disk. The
Poynting jets represent a likely model for the jets from active galactic

by observational data. The origin of this field has not as yet been explained
in a fully satisfactory way and represents one of the main challenges of the
astrophysical dynamo theory. In both the galactic dynamo theory and the
primordial-origin theory, a major influence is exerted by the small-scale
magnetic fluctuations. This article is devoted to constructing a systematic
second-order statistical theory of such small-scale fields. The statistics of
these fields are studied in the kinematic approximation and for the case of
large Prandtl numbers, which is relevant for the galactic and protogalactic
plasma. The advecting velocity field is assumed to be Gaussian and short-time
correlated. Theoretical understanding of this kinematic dynamo model is a
necessary prerequisite for any prospective nonlinear dynamo theory. The theory
is developed for an arbitrary degree of compressibility and formally in d
dimensions, which generalizes the previously known results, elicits the
structure of the solutions, and uncovers a number of new effects. The magnetic
energy spectra are studied as they grow and spread over scales during the
initial stage of the field amplification. Exact Green's-function solutions are
obtained. The spectral theory is supplemented by the study of magnetic-field
correlation functions in the configuration space, where the dynamo problem can
be mapped onto a particular one-dimensional quantum-mechanical problem. The
latter approach is most suitable for the description of the kinematic dynamo in
the long-time limit, i.e. when the magnetic excitation has spread over all
scales present in the system. A simple way of calculating the growth rates of
the magnetic fields in this long-time limit is proposed.

obtained with the SCUBA Polarimeter, is presented. The polarization map is
interpreted in terms of thermal radiation by magnetically aligned dust grains.
Two prominent cores associated with IRS 1 and IRS 11, IRS 1(SMM) and IRS
11(SMM), are found in the surface brightness map. Although these cores look
similar in surface brightness, their polarization shows striking differences.
In IRS 11(SMM), the polarization vectors are extremely well ordered, and the
degrees of polarization are quite high with an average of ~3.9 %. In IRS
1(SMM), on the other hand, the directions of polarization vectors are locally
disturbed, and the degrees of polarization are much lower than those of IRS
11(SMM). These differences suggest that small scale fluctuations of the
magnetic field are more prominent in IRS 1(SMM). This can be interpreted in
terms of the difference in evolutionary stage of the cores. Inside IRS 1(SMM),
which seems to be at a later evolutionary stage than IRS 11(SMM), substructures
such as subclumps or a cluster of infrared sources have already formed. Small
scale fluctuations in the magnetic field could have developed during the
formation of these substructures. The distribution of magnetic field directions
derived from our polarization map agrees well with those of molecular outflows
associated with IRS 1(SMM) and IRS 11(SMM). Comparisons of energy densities
between the magnetic field and the outflows show that the magnetic field
probably plays an important role in guiding the directions of the outflows.

less than about 10d. For reasonable assumptions concerning the period
distribution and the mass ratio distribution of the binaries, we find that the
mean detection efficiency of our survey over this range of orbital periods is
87%. Allowing for this estimated detection efficiency, the fraction of EHB
stars which are short-period binaries ($0.03 < P <10d, approximately) is
69+-9%. The value is not strongly dependent on the period distribution below
P=10d or the mean companion mass for these short-period binaries. The orbital
separation of the stars in these binaries is much less than the size of the red
giant from which the EHB star has formed. This is strong evidence that binary
star evolution is fundamental to the formation of the majority of EHB stars. If
there are also binary EHB stars whose orbital periods are more than about 10d,
the fraction of EHB stars whose evolution has been affected by the presence of
a companion may be much higher.

on-site Coulomb interaction on two inequivalent boron $p_z$-orbitals is
transformed into expressions in terms of $\pi$-band operators. For scattering
processes relevant to the problemin which a wave vector {\bf q} is parallel to
$\hat{z}$, it is found to take a relatively simple form consisting of
intra-band Coulomb scattering, interband pair scattering etc. with large
constant coupling constants. This allows to get a simple expression for the
amplitude of interband pair scattering between two $\pi$-bands, which diverges
if the interband polarization function in it becomes large enough.The latter
was approximately evaluated and found to be largely enhanced in the band
structure in MgB$_2$. These results lead to a divergent interband pair
scattering, meaning two-band-type superconducting instability with enhanced
$T_c$. Adding a subsidiary BCS attractive interaction in each band into
consideration, a semi-quantitative gap equation is given, and $T_c$ and isotope

quantities of interest in an interacting quantum field theory in curved
spacetime, it is necessary to construct Wick polynomials and their time ordered
products for the noninteracting theory. A construction of these quantities has
recently been given by Brunetti, Fredenhagen, and Kohler, and by Brunetti and
Fredenhagen, but they did not impose any ``locality'' or ``covariance''
condition in their constructions. As a consequence, their construction of time
ordered products contained ambiguities involving arbitrary functions of
spacetime point rather than arbitrary parameters. In this paper, we construct
an ``extended Wick polynomial algebra''-large enough to contain the Wick
polynomials and their time ordered products. We then define the notion of a
{\it local, covariant quantum field}, and seek a definition of {\it local} Wick
polynomials and their time ordered products as local, covariant quantum fields.
We impose scaling requirements on our local Wick polynomials and their time
ordered products as well as certain additional requirements-such as commutation
relations with the free field and appropriate continuity properties under
variations of the spacetime metric. For a given polynomial order in powers of
the field, we prove that these conditions uniquely determine the local Wick
polynomials and their time ordered products up to a finite number of
parameters. (These parameters correspond to the usual renormalization
ambiguities occurring in Minkowski spacetime together with additional
parameters corresponding to the coupling of the field to curvature.) We also
prove existence of local Wick polynomials. However, the issue of existence of
local time ordered products is deferred to a future investigation

exponentiation property in the two-jet region t = 1-T << 1. We present a
general method (DGE) to calculate a large class of logarithmically enhanced
terms, using the dispersive approach in renormalon calculus. Dressed Gluon
Exponentiation is based on the fact that the exponentiation kernel is
associated primarily with a single gluon emission, and therefore the exponent
is naturally represented as an integral over the running coupling. Fixing the
definition of Lambda is enough to guarantee consistency with the exact exponent
to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. Renormalization scale dependence is
avoided by keeping all the logs. Sub-leading logs, that are usually neglected,
are factorially enhanced and are therefore important. Renormalization-group
invariance as well as infrared renormalon divergence are recovered in the sum
of all the logs. The logarithmically enhanced cross-section is evaluated by
Borel summation. Renormalon ambiguity is then used to study power corrections
in the peak region Qt \gsim Lambda, where the hierarchy between the renormalon
closest to the origin (~1/Qt) and others (~1/(Qt)^n) starts to break down. The
exponentiated power-corrections can be described by a shape-function, as
advocated by Korchemsky and Sterman. Our calculation suggests that the even
central moments of the shape-function are suppressed. Good fits are obtained

the symmetric two-mixing-angle form of the widely discussed four-neutrino

natural because it is produced by a lepton charge symmetry violating

popular bimaximal mixing matrix for three active neutrinos that works
satisfactorily in solar and atmospheric experiments if the LSND effect is
ignored. One of three sterile neutrinos, effective in the Majorana righthanded

for the possible LSND effect by inducing one of three extra neutrino mass
states to exist actively. The corresponding form of neutrino mass matrix is
derived. If all three extra neutrino mass states get vanishing masses, the
neutrino mass matrix is dominated by its specific Majorana lefthanded part.
Then, the observed qualitative difference between mixings of neutrinos and down

construct resolved fractional M2-branes involving the use of the L^2 harmonic

actually the same local solution, with the two different complete manifolds

negative. We make a comparison with the Taub-NUT and Taub-BOLT metrics, which
by contrast do not have special holonomy. In an appendix we construct the

independent of the choice of M. We observe that the result is a significantly
simpler expression than the corresponding expression for the bosonic theory

non-trivial discrete fluxes.
  We find a number of new components in the string moduli space. Contained in
some of these components are M theory compactifications with novel kinds of
``frozen'' singularities. We are naturally led to conjecture the existence of
new dualities relating spaces with different singular geometries and fluxes. As
our study of these vacua unfolds, we also learn about additional topics
including: F theory on spaces without section, automorphisms of del Pezzo
surfaces, and novel physics (and puzzles) from equivariant K-theory. Lastly, we
comment on how the data we gain about the M theory three-form might be

structures present in the Nonlinear Maxwell Theory in continuation of work
presented in my previous articles. In particular, I display new types of both
dynamic and static solutions of the Nonlinear Maxwell Equations (NM). I point
out how the resulting theory ties to the Quantum Mechanics of Correlated
Electrons inasmuch as it provides a mesoscopic description of phenomena like
nonresistive charge transport, static magnetic flux tubes, and charge stripes
in a way consistent with both the phenomenology and the microscopic principles.
In addition, I point at a bunch of geometric structures intrinsic for the
theory. On one hand, the presence of these structures indicates that the
equations at hand can be used as `probing tools' for purely geometric
exploration of low-dimensional manifolds. On the other hand, global aspects of
these structures are in my view prerequisite to incorporating (quantum)
informational features of Correlated Electron Systems within the framework of
the Nonlinear Maxwell Theory.

(in which the density matrix is linearly related to a set of measured
quantities) and a maximum likelihood technique which requires numerical
optimization (but has the advantage of producing density matrices which are
always non-negative definite). In addition a detailed error analysis is
presented, allowing errors in quantities derived from the density matrix, such
as the entropy or entanglement of formation, to be estimated. Examples based on
