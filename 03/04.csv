biggest individual QSO survey. The aim for the survey is to have ~25000 QSO
redshifts, providing an order of magnitude increase in QSO clustering
statistics. We first describe the observational parameters of the 2dF QSO
survey. We then describe several highlights of the survey so far; we present
new estimates of the QSO luminosity function and the QSO correlation function.
We also present the first estimate of the QSO power spectrum from the 2QZ
catalogue, probing the form of the fluctuation power-spectrum out to the
\~1000h-1Mpc scales only previously probed by COBE. We find a power spectrum
which is steeper than the prediction of standard CDM and more consistent with
the prediction of Lambda-CDM. The best-fit value for the power spectrum shape
parameter for a range of cosmologies is Gamma=0.1+-0.1. Finally, we discuss how
the complete QSO survey will be able to constrain the value of Omega_Lambda by
combining results from the evolution of QSO clustering and from a geometric
test of clustering isotropy.

the gamma-ray burst GRB 980703 taken 17, 551, 710, and 716 days after the

V_gal = 23.00 +/- 0.10, (V-R)_gal = 0.43 +/- 0.13, and a centre that is
approximately 0.2 mag bluer than the outer regions of the galaxy. The galaxy
has a star-formation rate of 8-13 M_sun/yr, assuming no extinction in the host.
We find that the galaxy is best fit by a Sersic R^(1/n) profile with n ~= 1.0
and a half-light radius of 0.13 arcsec (= 0.72/h_100 proper kpc). This
corresponds to an exponential disk with a scale radius of 0.22 arcsec (=
1.21/h_100 proper kpc). Subtracting a fit with elliptical isophotes leaves
large residuals, which suggests that the host galaxy has a somewhat irregular
morphology, but we are unable to connect the location of GRB 980703 with any
special features in the host. The host galaxy appears to be a typical example
of a compact star forming galaxy similar to those found in the Hubble Deep
Field North. The R-band light curve of the optical afterglow associated with
this gamma-ray burst is consistent with a single power-law decay having a slope
of alpha = -1.37 +/- 0.14. Due to the bright underlying host galaxy the late
time properties of the light-curve are very poorly constrained. The decay of
the optical light curve is consistent with a contribution from an underlying
Type Ic supernova like SN1998bw, or a dust echo, but such contributions cannot
be securely established.

low-temperature region of the FISDW diagram is characterized by a hysteresis
behavior typical for the first order transitions, as observed in a number of
studies. In contrast to the common believe, in high temperature region of the
FISDW phase diagram, the hysteresis and, hence, the first order transitions
were found to disappear. Nevertheless, sharp changes in the resistivity slope
are observed both in the low and high temperature domains indicating that the
cascade of transitions between different subphases exists over all range of the

  C","Phys.Rev. C63 (2001) 055203","10.1103/PhysRevC.63.055203",,"nucl-th",,"  The quark mean field model, which describes the nucleon using the constituent
quark model, is applied to investigate the properties of finite nuclei. The
couplings of the scalar and vector mesons with quarks are made density
dependent through direct coupling to the scalar field so as to reproduce the
relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock results of nuclear matter. The present
model provides satisfactory results on the properties of spherical nuclei, and
predicts an increasing size of the nucleon as well as a reduction of the
nucleon mass in the nuclear environment

Gaussian beam diffraction. In addition to the well-known parallels between
pulse dispersion in optical fiber and CW beam diffraction in free space, we
review temporal lenses as a way to describe nonlinearities in the propagation
equations, and then introduce further concepts that permit the description of
pulse evolution in more complicated systems. These include the temporal
equivalent of a spherical dielectric interface, which is used by way of example
to derive design parameters used in a recent dispersion-mapped soliton
transmission experiment. Our formalism offers a quick, concise and powerful
approach to analyzing a variety of linear and nonlinear pulse propagation
phenomena in optical fibers.

applications to Quantum Computation and its efficiency problems are shown in
the second half. An interesting current topic of Holonomic Quantum Computation
is also covered.

field. By using a time-dependent unitary transformation, the Dirac equation
with the time-dependent Hamiltonian can be reduced to a Dirac-like equation
with a time-independent effective Hamiltonian. Eigenstates of the effective
Hamiltonian correspond to cyclic solutions of the original Dirac equation. The
nonadiabatic geometric phase of a cyclic solution can be expressed in terms of
the expectation value of the component of the total angular momentum along the
rotating axis, regardless of whether the solution is explictly available. For a
slowly rotating magnetic field, the eigenvalue problem of the effective
Hamiltonian is solved approximately and the geometric phases are calculated.
The same problem for a charged or neutral Dirac particle with an anomalous
magnetic moment is discussed briefly.

surprising that it gives a nonvanishing cross section when $\alpha=1$ and
$\Omega=-1$. When the contact potential is approached by a spherical square
well potential instead of the above spherical shell one, one obtains basically
the same result except that the parameter $\Omega$ that gives a nonvanishing
cross section is different. Similar problems in two and one dimensions are
studied and results of the same nature are obtained.

model employed is strictly local. The correlation is determined by its
classical expression with one decisive difference: we sum up coincidences for
each pair individually. We analyze the effects of decoherence, detector
efficiency and polarizer thresholds in detail. The Bell inequalities are
violated in these simulations. The violation depends crucially on the threshold
of the polarizer switches and can reach a value of 2.0 in the limiting case.
Existing experiments can be fully accounted for by limited coherence and
non-ideal detector switches. It seems thus safe to conclude that the Bell
inequalities are no suitable criterium to decide on the nonlocality issue.
