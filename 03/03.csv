from SDSS imaging data and confirmed for this study by matching to X-ray
sources found independently in the ROSAT all sky survey (RASS). Five color SDSS
photometry is used to make accurate photometric redshift estimates that are
used to rescale and combine the lensing measurements. The mean shear from these
clusters is detected to 2 h-1 Mpc at the 7-sigma level, corresponding to a mass
within that radius of 4.2 +/- 0.6 x 10^14 h-1 M_sun. The shear profile is well
fit by a power law with index -0.9 +/- 0.3, consistent with that of an

J0911.4+0551 using data obtained with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer
(ACIS) on board the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The 29 ks observation detects a
total of ~404 X-ray photons (0.3 to 7.0 keV) from the four images of the lensed
quasar. Deconvolution of the aspect corrected data resolves all four lensed
images, with relative positions in good agreement with optical measurements.
When compared to contemporaneous optical data, one of the lensed images
(component A3) is dimmer by a factor of ~6 in X-rays with respect to the 2
brighter images (components A1 and A2). Spectral fitting for the combined
images shows significant intrinsic absorption in the soft (0.2 to 2.4 keV)
energy band, consistent with the mini-BAL nature of this quasar, while a
comparison with ROSAT PSPC observations from 1990 shows a drop of ~6.5 in the
total soft bandpass flux. The observations also detect ~157 X-ray photons
arising from extended emission of the nearby cluster (peaked ~42"" SW of
RXJ0911.4+0551) responsible for the large external shear present in the system.
The Chandra observation reveals the cluster emission to be complex and
non-spherical, and yields a cluster temperature of kT = 2.3^{+1.8}_{-0.8} keV
and a 2.0 to 10 keV cluster luminosity within a 1 Mpc radius of L_X =
7.6_{-0.2}^{+0.6} x 10^{43} ergs/s (error bars denote 90% confidence limits).
Our mass estimate of the cluster within its virial radius is 2.3^{+1.8}_{-0.7}

previous mass estimates based on the observed cluster velocity dispersion.

the seed photons for thermal Comptonization be produced locally in the hot

V_rot*sin(i)=123 +/- 4 km/sec (1 sigma errors). Assuming synchronous rotation,
our measured value of the projected rotational velocity implies a mass ratio of

limit to the inclination of i<70.7 deg. On the other hand, the large amplitude

the mass of the secondary star is in the range 5.49 < M_2 < 8.14 solar masses

apparent conflicts of Cold Dark Matter (DM) models with observations. Endowing
the DM particles with non-negligible velocities causes free-streaming, which
suppresses the primordial power spectrum on small scales. The choice of a
root-mean-square velocity dispersion v(rms) = 0.05 km/s at redshift z=0
(corresponding to a particle mass of 1 keV if the WDM particles are fermions
decoupling while relativistic) helps alleviate most, but probably not all, of
the small-scale problems faced by CDM. An important side-effect of the particle
velocities is the severe decrease in the number of collapsed halos at high
redshift. This is caused both by the loss of small-scale power, and by the
delay in the collapse of the smallest individual halos (with masses near the
effective Jeans mass of the DM). The presence of early halos is required in
order (1) to host either early quasars or galaxies that can reionize the
universe by redshift z=5.8, and (2) to allow the growth of the supermassive
black hole believed to power the recently discovered quasar SDSS 1044-1215 at
this redshift. We quantify these constraints using a modified Press-Schechter
formalism, and find v(rms) < 0.04 km/s (or m_X > 1 keV). If future observations
uncover massive black holes at z > 10, or reveal that reionization occurred at
z > 10, this could conclusively rule out WDM models as the solution to the
small-scale crisis of the CDM paradigm.

discrete wavelet transform (DWT) representation. Although the mean DWT power
spectrum is consistent with its counterpart in Fourier representation, the
spatial distribution of the local power varies greatly, i.e. the local DWT
power spectra show remarkably spiky structures on small scales. To measure
these spiky features, we introduce the quantities, roughness, of the local
power spectrum, and the correlation between spikes on different scales. We then
test the predictions made by the correlation hierarchy model on the roughness
and the scale-scale correlations of the local power spectrum. Using the
Ly_alpha transmitted flux of the QSO HS1700, we find that the underlying cosmic
mass field of the transmitted flux at redshift around z ~ 2.2 can be described
by the hierarchical clustering model on physical scales from 2.5 h^{-1} Mpc to
few tens h^{-1} kpc in an Einstein-de Sitter universe. However, the non-linear
features of the clustering show differences on different scale ranges; 1. On
physical scales larger than ~ 1.3 h^{-1} Mpc, the field is almost Gaussian. 2.
On scales 1.3 h^{-1} Mpc - 0.3 h^{-1} Mpc, the field is consistent with the
correlation hierarchy with a constant value for the coefficient Q_4. 3. On
scales less than 300 h^{-1} kpc, the field is no longer Gaussian, but
essentially intermittent. In this case, the field can still be fitted by the
correlation hierarchy, but the coefficient, Q_4, should be scale-dependent.
These three points are strongly supported by the following result: the scale
dependencies of Q_4 given by two statistically independent measures, i.e. Q_4^R
by the roughness and Q_4^C by scale-scale correlation, are the same in the
entire scale range considered.

narrow emission line galaxies (NELGs), 5 galaxies with no visible emission
lines, 8 clusters and 8 Galactic stars. The BLAGN, NELGs and galaxies have
similar distributions of X-ray flux and spectra. Their ROSAT spectra are
consistent with their being AGN obscured by columns of 20.5<log(NH/cm^2)<23.
The hard spectrum BLAGN have a distribution of X-ray to optical ratios which is
similar to that found for AGN from soft X-ray surveys (1<alpha_OX<2). However,
a relatively large proportion (15%) of the BLAGN, NELGs and galaxies are radio
loud. This could be because the radio jets in these objects produce
intrinsically hard X-ray emission, or if their hardness is due to absorption,
it could be because radio loud objects are more X-ray luminous than radio quiet
objects. The 8 hard sources identified as clusters of galaxies are the
brightest, and softest group of sources and hence clusters are unlikely to be
an important component of the hard, faint population. We propose that BLAGN are
likely to constitute a significant fraction of the faint, hard, 0.5 - 2 keV
population and could be important to reproducing the shape of the X-ray
background, because they are the most numerous type of object in our sample
(comprising almost half the identified sources), and because all our high

fermion-photon vertex and the fermion propagator are related through a
Ward-Takahashi Identity (WTI). This relation splits the vertex into two parts:
longitudinal (Gamma_L) and transverse (Gamma_T). Gamma_L is fixed by the WTI.
The description of the longitudinal part consumes 8 of the basis vectors. The
remaining piece Gamma_T is then written in terms of 24 spin amplitudes.
Extending the work of Ball and Chiu and Kizilersu et. al., we propose a set of
basis vectors T^mu_i(P_1,P_2) at finite temperature such that each of these is
transverse to the photon four-momentum and also satisfies T^mu_i(P,P)=0, in
accordance with the Ward Identity, with their corresponding coefficients being
free of kinematic singularities. This basis reduces to the form proposed by
Kizilersu et. al. at zero temperature. We also evaluate explicitly the
coefficient of each of these vectors at the above-mentioned level of
approximation.

different informations about the geometry of the higher dimensional automaton
modeled by the precubical set. Adding inverses in this $\omega$-category to any
morphism of dimension greater than 2 and with respect to any composition laws
of dimension greater than 1 does not change these homology theories. In such a
framework, the globular nerve always satisfies the Kan condition. On the other
