galaxies, obtained using UKIRT in Hawaii. This constitutes a fair sample of the
most common types of starburst galaxies found in the nearby Universe. The
variety of near infrared spectral features shown by these galaxies implies
different bursts characteristics, which suggests that we survey galaxies with
different star formation histories or at different stages of their burst
evolution.
  Using synthetic starburst models, we conclude that the best ensemble of
parameters which describe starburst galaxies in the nearby universe are a
constant rate of star formation, a Salpeter IMF with an upper mass cutoff equal
to 30 solar mass and bursts ages between 10 Myr and 1 Gyr. The model is fully
consistent with the differences observed in the optical and FIR between the
different types of starbursts. It suggests that HII galaxies have younger
bursts and lower metallicities than SBNGs, while LIRGs have younger bursts but
higher metallicities.
  Our observations suggest that the starburst phenomenon must be a sustained or
self--sustained phenomenon: either star formation is continuous in time or
multiple bursts happen in sequence over a relatively long period of time. The
generality of our observations implies that this is a characteristic of
starburst galaxies in the nearby Universe.

describe the results of an astronomical seeing campaign, carried out with a
Differential Image Motion Monitor that operates at 0.5 micron wavelength. The
seeing at the Llano level of 5000 m, measured over 7 nights in May 1998,

seeing expected in the region; the set of measurements provides a reference

types and ages are comparable with those of HD 52721 and HD 53367. This
indicates that the presence of a disc around a star in CMa R1 may depend on the
environment of the star. In particular we find that all Halpha emission stars
are located at or outside the arc-shaped border of the H II region, which
suggests that the stars inside the arc have lost their discs through
evaporation by UV photons from nearby O stars, or from the nearby (< 25 pc)

simulations are carried out using N-body algorithms that can follow the

density cusps similar to those in low-luminosity elliptical galaxies. Formation
of a black-hole binary transfers energy to the stars and lowers the central
density; continued decay of the binary creates a ~1/r density cusp similar to
those observed in bright elliptical galaxies, with a break radius that extends
well beyond the sphere of gravitational influence of the black holes. The decay
of the black hole binary is followed over a factor of ~20 in separation after
formation of a hard binary, considerably farther than in previous simulations.
We see almost no dependence of the binary's decay rate on number of particles
in the simulation, contrary to earlier studies in which a lower initial density
of stars led to a more rapid depletion of the binary's loss cone. We
nevertheless argue that the decay of a black hole binary in a real galaxy would
be expected to stall at separations of 0.01-1 pc unless some additional
mechanism is able to extract energy from the binary. Our results support a
picture in which the observed dependence of nuclear cusp slope on galaxy
luminosity is a consequence of galaxy interactions. We also discuss the
implications of our results for the survivability of dark-matter cusps.

CL1358+62 (z=0.33), MS2053--04 (z=0.58), and MS1054--03 (z=0.83). By comparing
the correlation of Balmer line strength with velocity dispersion for E/S0s in
the three clusters, we find moderate evolution in the zero-point of the
(Hdelta_A+Hgamma_A)-sigma relation with redshift. The trend is consistent with
passive evolution of old stellar populations. Under the assumption that the
samples can be compared directly, we use single-burst stellar population
synthesis models to constrain the last major occurrences of star-formation in
the observed E/S0s to be z_f > 2.5 (95% confidence). We have compared the
evolution of the Balmer absorption with the evolution of the B-band fundamental
plane and find that simple stellar population models agree very well with the
data. While the best agreement occurs with a low value for Omega_m, the data
provide strong confirmation of the time-evolution in recent stellar population
models.

consistent with that found in a preliminary investigation of this cluster with

stellar mass function is consistently flat at the low mass end. Moreover, while
the gas mass function follows the dark matter mass function until reionization
at z~7, between z=7 and z=4, the gas mass function also flattens considerably
at the low mass end. At z=4, the gas and stellar mass functions are fit by a
Schechter function with \alpha ~ -1.2 +/- 0.1, significantly shallower than the
dark matter halo mass function and consistent with some recent observations.
The baryonic mass functions are shallower because (a) the dark matter halo mass
function is consistent with the Press-Schechter formulation at low masses n(M)
  M^-2 and (b) heating/cooling and ionization processes appear to cause baryons
to collect in halos with the relationship M_b M_d^4 at low masses. Combining
(a) and (b) gives n(M_b) M_b^-5/4, comparable to the simulation results. Thus,
the well known observational fact that low mass galaxies are underabundant as
compared to expectations from numerical dark matter simulations or
Press-Schechter modeling of CDM universes emerges naturally from these results,
implying that perhaps no ``new physics'' beyond the standard model is needed.

  The revised version includes a new analysis of stability to gravitational
  modes",,"10.1086/322267",,"astro-ph",,"  Many models of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) involve accretion onto a compact
object, usually a black hole, at a mass accretion rate of order a fraction of a
solar mass per second. If the accretion disk is larger than a few tens or
hundreds of Schwarzschild radii, the accretion will proceed via a
convection-dominated accretion flow (CDAF) in which most of the matter escapes
to infinity rather than falling onto the black hole. Models involving the
mergers of black hole white dwarf binaries and black hole helium star binaries
fall in this category. These models are unlikely to produce GRBs since very
little mass reaches the black hole. If the accretion disk is smaller, then
accretion will proceed via neutrino cooling in a neutrino-dominated accretion
disk (NDAF) and most of the mass will reach the center. Models involving the
mergers of double neutron star binaries and black hole neutron star binaries
fall in this category and are capable of producing bright GRBs. If the
viscosity parameter $\alpha$ in the NDAF has a standard value $\sim0.1$, these
mergers can explain short GRBs with durations under a second, but they are
unlikely to produce long GRBs with durations of tens or hundred of seconds. If
the accretion disk is fed by fallback of material after a supernova explosion,
as in the collapsar model, then the time scale of the burst is determined by
fallback, not accretion. Such a model can produce long GRBs. Fallback models
again require that the accretion should proceed via an NDAF rather than a CDAF
in order for a significant amount of mass to reach the black hole. This
condition imposes an upper limit on the radius of injection of the gas.

relativistic effects influencing photons emitted by the disc are taken into
account. The emerging spectrum, as seen by a distant observer, is parametrized
by the black hole mass and spin, the accretion rate, the disc inclination angle
and the inner disc radius. We fit the ASCA soft state X-ray spectra of LMC X-1

variability that characterises the X-ray lightcurves of X-ray binaries and

stationary (i.e. constant amplitude and shape) on short time-scales. We show
that the broadband noise power spectra of the black hole candidate Cyg X-1 and
the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 are intrinsically
non-stationary, in that RMS variability scales linearly with flux.
Flux-selected power spectra confirm that this effect is due to changes in
power-spectral amplitude and not shape. The lightcurves of three Seyfert
galaxies are also consistent with a linear relationship between RMS variability
and flux, suggesting that it is an intrinsic feature of the broadband noise
variability in compact accreting systems over more than 6 decades of central
object mass. The RMS variability responds to flux variations on all measured
time-scales, raising fundamental difficulties for shot-noise models which seek
to explain this result by invoking variations in the shot parameters. We
suggest that models should be explored where the longest time-scale variations
are fundamental and precede the variations on shorter time-scales. Possible
models which can explain the linear RMS-flux relation include the fractal
break-up of large coronal flares, or the propagation of fluctuations in mass
accretion rate through the accretion disk. The linear relationship between RMS
variability and flux in Cyg X-1 and SAX J1808.4-3658 is offset on the flux
axis, suggesting the presence of a second, constant-flux component to the
lightcurve which contributes 25% of the total flux. The spectrum of this
constant component is similar to the total spectrum [abridged].

do not expect the formation of pseudo gaps in a three dimensional material.
According to our arguments, the upper critical dimension d_c for the formation
of pseudo gaps is d_c=2. However, at the present stage we cannot rule out a
higher upper critical dimension, 2 < d_c <= 3. We also discuss briefly the role
of statistical interactions in pseudo gap phases.

choice of the substrate allows the growth of thin Fe overlayers with structures
different from the bcc bulk one. The Cu3Au(001) substrate is a suitable
candidate for testing these magnetic properties since it has a lattice
parameter (3.75 Angstroms) which lies closer to the ferromagnetic fcc Fe phase
(3.66 Angstroms) than to the ferromagnetic bcc phase (4.07 Angstroms). We have
investigated Fe films up to 40 Angstroms thickness by means of Grazing
Incidence X-Ray Diffraction (GIXRD) and Photo/Auger--Electron Diffraction (ED).
The combination of GIXRD and ED allows one to obtain quantitative information
on the in--plane spacing ""a"" from the former technique, and the ratio between
the vertical spacing ""c"" and ""a"", from the latter one. At low coverage the film
grows pseudomorphic to the fcc substrate up to a limit thickness of 8
Angstroms. Above this limit the film is characterized by the coexistence of the
pseudomorphic phase with another tetragonally strained phase. The latter phase
is shown to fall on the epitaxial curve of tetragonally distorted fcc Fe phase.
Finally, above 17 Angstroms the development of a body centered phase ""alpha"",

been clearly observed. ""alpha"" is the dominating phase for film thickness
higher than 25 Angstroms and its lattice constant evolves towards the

interpretation of experimental evidence leads to the conclusion that the
postulates upon which relativity theory is based, particularly the invariance
of the speed of light, are not applicable to rotating frames. Different
postulates based on the Sagnac experiment are proposed, and from these
postulates a new relativistic theory of rotating frames is developed following
steps similar to those initially followed by Einstein for rectilinear motion.
The resulting theory agrees with all experiments, resolves problems with the
traditional approach to the rotating disk, and exhibits both traditionally
relativistic and non-relativistic characteristics. Of particular note, no
Lorentz contraction exists on the rotating disk circumference, and the disk
surface, contrary to the assertions of Einstein and others, is found to be
Riemann flat. The variable speed of light found in the Sagnac experiment is
then shown to be characteristic of non-time-orthogonal reference frames, of
which the rotating frame is one. In addition, the widely accepted postulate for
the equivalence of inertial and non-inertial standard rods with zero relative
velocity, used liberally in prior rotating disk analyses, is shown to be
invalid for such frames. Further, the new theory stands alone in correctly
predicting what was heretofore considered a ""spurious"" non-null effect on the
order of 10^-13 found by Brillet and Hall in the most accurate Michelson-Morley
type test to date. The presentation is simple and pedagogic in order to make it

of the muon (MMM). In models with only SM gauge and Higgs fields in the bulk,
the contribution to the MMM from Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations of gauge bosons
is very small. This is due to the constraint on the size of the extra
dimensions from tree-level effects of KK excitations of gauge bosons on
precision electroweak observables such as Fermi constant. If the quarks and
leptons are also allowed to propagate in the (same) bulk (``universal'' extra
dimensions), then there are no contributions to precision electroweak
observables at tree-level. However, in this case, the constraint from one-loop
contribution of KK excitations of (mainly) the top quark to T parameter again
implies that the contribution to the MMM is small. We show that in models with
leptons, electroweak gauge and Higgs fields propagating in the (same) bulk, but
with quarks and gluon propagating in a sub-space of this bulk, both the above
constraints can be relaxed. However, with only one Higgs doublet, the
constraint from the process b -> s gamma requires the contribution to the MMM
to be smaller than the SM electroweak correction. This constraint can be
relaxed in models with more than one Higgs doublet.

experimental data on electron and muon deep inelastic scattering (DIS). The
distributions are given at Q^2=1 GeV^2 with a number of parameters, which are
determined by a chi^2 analysis of the data. Valence-quark distributions are
relatively well determined at medium x, but they are slightly dependent on the
assumed parametrization form particularly at small x. Although antiquark
distributions are shadowed at small x, their behavior is not obvious at medium
x from the F_2 data. The gluon distributions could not be restricted well by
the inclusive DIS data; however, the analysis tends to support the gluon
shadowing at small x. We provide analytical expressions and computer
subroutines for calculating the nuclear parton distributions, so that other
researchers could use them for applications to other high-energy nuclear

wide class of quadratic combinations involving these three sets of Dunkl

equations to the first order in perturbation. For zero cross helicity and space

length-scales (forward cascade). In addition, there are energy fluxes from
large-scale magnetic field to small-scale velocity field, large-scale velocity
field to small-scale magnetic field, and large-scale velocity field to
large-scale magnetic field. Kolmogorov's constant for magnetohydrodynamics is
approximately equal to that for fluid turbulence ($\approx 1.6$) for Alfv\'{e}n
ratio $0.5 \le r_A \le \infty$. For higher space-dimensions, the energy fluxes
are qualitatively similar, and Kolmogorov's constant varies as $d^{1/3}$. For
the normalized cross helicity $\sigma_c \to 1$, the cascade rates are
proportional to $(1-\sigma_c)/ (1+\sigma_c)$, and the Kolmogorov's constants
vary significantly with $\sigma_c$.

hyperon $\Lambda$ is more abundant than the proton at high baryon density, a
