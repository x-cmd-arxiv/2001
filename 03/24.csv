from 23 to 1.1 M_sol, and stellar evolution models produced with our newly
revised code TYCHO. ``Overshooting'' and rotational mixing were suppressed in
order to establish a baseline for isolating these and other hydrodynamic
effects. Acceptable coeval fits are found for sixteen pairs without optimizing
for heavy element or helium abundance. The precision of these tests is limited
by the accuracies of the observed effective temperatures. High dispersion
spectra and detailed atmospheric modeling should give more accurate effective
temperatures and heavy element abundances. PV Cas, a peculiar early A system,
EK Cep B, a known post-T Tauri star, and RS Cha, a member of a young OB
association, are matched by pre-main sequence models. Predicted mass loss
agrees with upper limits from IUE for CW Cep A and B. Relatively poor fits are
obtained for binaries having at least one component in the mass range 1.7 <
M/M_sol <2.6, whose evolution is sensitive to mixing. These discrepancies are
robust and consistent with additional mixing in real stars. The predicted
apsidal motion implies that massive star models are systematically less
centrally condensed than the real stars. If these effects are due to
overshooting, then the overshooting parameter alpha_OV increases with stellar
mass. The apsidal motion constants are controlled by radiative opacity under
conditions close to those directly measured in laser experiments, making this
test more stringent than possible before.

Magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations, the effects of magnetic fields on

field topologies and strengths ($B \simeq 260 \mu$G-0). The relative
differences that have been previously detected in 2-D simulations involving
distinct magnetic field configurations are diminished in the 3-D flows. While
the presence of toroidal magnetic components can modify the morphology close to
the jet head inhibiting its fragmentation in the early jet evolution, as
previously reported in the literature, the impact of the pulsed-induced
internal knots causes the appearance of a complex morphology at the jet head
(as required by the observations of H-H jets) even in the MHD jet models with
toroidal components. The detailed structure and emission properties of the
internal working surfaces can be also significantly altered by the presence of
magnetic fields. The increase of the magnetic field strength improves the jet
collimation, and amplifies the density (by factors up to 1.4, and 4) and the
H\alpha$ intensity (by factors up to 4, and 5) behind the knots of jets with
helical field and $\beta \simeq 1-0.1$ (respectively), relative to a non
magnetic jet. As a consequence, the corresponding $I_{[SII]}}/I_{H}\alpha}$
ratio (which is frequently used to determine the excitation level of HH
objects) can be decreased in the MHD models with toroidal components relative
to non-magnetic calculations. We also find that the helical mode of the K-H
instability can be triggered in MHD models with helical magnetic fields,
causing some jet wiggling. No evidence for the formation of the nose cones is
found in the 3-D flows, nor even in the $\beta \simeq 0.1$ case.

fission yeast cells in a suspension was mainly composed of two sub-dispersions.
The low-frequency sub-dispersion depended on the cell length, whereas the
high-frequency one was independent of it. The cell shape effect was
qualitatively simulated by an ellipsoidal cell model. However, the comparison
between theory and experiment was far from being satisfactory. In an attempt to
close up the gap between theory and experiment, we considered the more
realistic cells of spherocylinders, i.e., circular cylinders with two
hemispherical caps at both ends. We have formulated a Green function formalism
for calculating the spectral representation of cells of finite length. The
Green function can be reduced because of the azimuthal symmetry of the cell.
This simplification enables us to calculate the dispersion spectrum and hence
access the effect of cell structure on the dielectric behavior of cell
suspensions.

polarity of the smectic-{\it C} phase, which is not related to molecular
chirality but underlies the appearance of spontaneous polarisation in chiral
smectics. A phenomenological theory of the phase transition is formulated by
means of a Landau expansion in two tilt order parameters (primary and
secondary) and an indigenous polarity order parameter. The coupling among these
order parameters determines the possibility of sign inversions in the

observed experimentally for some chiral smectic-{\it $C^{\ast}$} materials. The

near future when the new data on the terrestrial gravitational field from the

of the measurement. As a secondary outcome of the proposed experiment, with the
so obtained value of $\ppn$ and with $\et=4\beta-\gamma-3$ from Lunar Laser

of extreme black branes. In this picture, the size of the horizon can be
interpreted as the compactification size. The large mass hierarchy is simply
translated into the large horizon size, which is provided by the magnitude of
charges carried by the black branes. Hence, the macroscopic compactification
size is a quantity calculable from the microscopic theory which has only one
physical scale, and its stabilization is guaranteed from the charge
conservation.
