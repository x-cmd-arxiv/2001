violating conventional laws of physics. The initial cosmological singularity is
resolved by introducing the uncertainty principle of quantum theory. We
postulate that, preceding the big bang at the end of the gravitational
collapse, the total observed mass including all forms of energy of the universe
condensed into the primordial black hole (PBH) in a state of isotropic and
minimal chaos (i.e., nearest to the absolute zero temperature). The frozen
energy of the collapsed state is quantized such that each quantum of frozen
energy (the cosmic particle) is characterized by the fundamental constants of
the general theory of relativity and of quantum theory. The minimum size and
minimum lifetime of the cosmic particle are estimated within the framework of
the uncertainty principle. It is considered that these cosmic particles are
bosons with intrinsic spin zero. The minimum size and thermodynamic properties
of the PBH are estimated within the framework of the Bose-Einstein statistics
by taking into account the total observed mass of the universe. The mechanism
of the big bang is given and the currently accepted Planck temperature at the
beginning of the big bang is predicted. The critical mass density, the mean
mass density, and the missing mass are calculated as a function of the Hubble
time of expansion. Our calculations show that the universe is closed but
expanding. However, the universe remains inside the event horizon of the
primordial black hole.

(1) It does not violate any known laws of physics. This contrasts with the Big
Bang model where all known laws of physics break down in the consideration of

behind the initial explosion is provided in this new model. The Big Bang model
does not explain what caused the initial explosion. (3) The homogenous nature

homogeneity of the universe. (4) This new model eliminates the mystery of why

to promptly conduct followup observations for the identified events. Compared

or a cluster of galaxies, and this poses a familiar struggle between particle
method and mean field method. In a bottom-up approach, a puzzle has been laid
on whether a quadruple lens can produce 17 images. The number of images is
governed by the gravitational lens equation, and the equation for $n$-tuple
lenses suggests that the maximum number of images of a point source potentially
increases as $n^2+1$. Indeed, the classes of $n=1, 2, 3$ lenses produce up to
$n^2+1 = 2, 5, 10$ images. We discuss the $n$-point lens system as a
two-dimensional harmonic flow of an inviscid fluid, count the caustics
topologically, recognize the significance of the limit points and discuss the
notion of image domains. We conjecture that the total number of positive images
is bounded by the number of finite limit points $2(n-1): n>1$ (1 limit point at
$\infty$ if $n=1$). A corollary is that the total number of images of a point
source produced by an $n$-tuple lens can not exceed $5(n-1):n>1$. We construct
quadruple lenses with distinct finite limit points that can produce up to 15
images and argue why there can not be more than 15 images. We show that the

the aperture mass, are sensitive to different physical halo properties

aperture mass is much wider for NFW than for isothermal haloes. We use recent
modifications to the Press-Schechter mass function in CDM models normalised to
the local abundance of rich clusters, to predict the properties of the halo
sample expected to be accessible with the aperture mass technique. While ~10
haloes should be detected per square degree if the haloes have NFW profiles,

  (1) We discuss the different effects that may have changed the gas
composition of the nebula since it was ejected
  (2) We calculate the expected abundance changes at the stellar surface due to
envelope convection in the red supergiant phase. If the observed LBV nebulae
are ejected during the RSG phase, the abundances of the LBV nebulae require a
significantly smaller amount of mass to be lost than assumed in evolutionary
models.
  (3) We calculate the changes in the surface composition during the main
sequence phase by rotation induced mixing. If the nebulae are ejected at the
end of the MS-phase, the abundances in LBV nebulae are compatible with mixing
times between 5 x 10^6 and 1 x 10^7 years. The existence of ON stars supports
this scenario.
  (4) The predicted He/H ratio in the nebulae are significantly smaller than
the current observed photospheric values of their central stars.
  Combining various arguments we show that the LBV nebulae are ejected during
the blue SG phase and that the stars have not gone through a RSG phase. The
chemical enhancements are due to rotation induced mixing, and the ejection is
possibly triggered by near-critical rotation. During the ejection, the outflow
was optically thick, which resulted in a large effective radius and a low
effective temperature. This also explains the observed properties of LBV dust.

M*_B+1, than previous studies. We compare A2218 with similar samples drawn from
local clusters to identify evolutionary changes between the samples which have
occured over the last 3Gyrs. The overall picture is one of little or no
evolution in nearly all galaxy parameters. Zeropoint offsets in the
Faber--Jackson, Mg_b-sigma and Fundamental Plane relations are all consistent
with passively evolving stellar populations. The slopes of these relations have
not changed significantly. We do however find a significant spread in the
estimated luminosity-weighted ages of the stellar populations in the galaxies,
based on line diagnostic diagrams. This age spread is seen in both the disky
early-type galaxies (S0) and also the ellipticals. We observe both ellipticals
with a strong contribution from a young stellar population and lenticulars
dominated by old stellar populations. On average, we find no evidence for
systematic differences between the populations of ellipticals and lenticulars.
This points to a common formation epoch for the bulk of the stars in most of
the early-type galaxies in A2218. This result can be reconciled with the claims
of rapid morphological evolution in distant clusters if the suggested
transformation from spirals to lenticulars does not involve significant new

thermodynamic phase transition, or by intermediate phases, as was recently
shown in a polymeric system. Here we report a first-order inverse melting of
the magnetic flux line lattice in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 superconductor. At low
temperatures, the material disorder causes significant pinning of the vortices,
which prevents observation of their equilibrium properties. Using a newly
introduced 'vortex dithering' technique we were able to equilibrate the vortex
lattice. As a result, direct thermodynamic evidence of inverse melting
transition is found, at which a disordered vortex phase transforms into an
ordered lattice with increasing temperature. Paradoxically, the structurally
ordered lattice has larger entropy than the disordered phase. This finding
shows that the destruction of the ordered vortex lattice occurs along a unified
first-order transition line that gradually changes its character from
thermally-induced melting at high temperatures to a disorder-induced transition
at low temperatures.

calculate the tunneling current due to the elastic and inelastic co-tunneling

considered: (i) for a low excitation energy, the excited state can decay only
by inelastic co-tunneling due to Coulomb blockade (ii) for a higher excitation
energy the excited state can decay by sequential tunneling. We consider two
spin-degenerate orbitals that are active in the transport. The nonequilibrium
state of the dot is described using master equations taking spin degrees of
freedom into account. The transition rates are calculated up to second order in
perturbation theory. To calculate the current we derive a closed set of master

beliefs about her own epistemic state as well as the external world. The second
is the status of observations. (Are observations known to be true, or just
believed? In the latter case, how firm is the belief?) Issues regarding the

inflation and gravitational fields has been created. This invariant theory
allows one to compare gauges used in the work of other researchers and to find
the unambiguous criteria to separate the physical and coordinate effects. It is
shown, in particular, that the so-called longitudial gauge, commonly used when
considering inflation instability, leads to a fundamental overestimation of the
effect because of non-physical perturbations of the proper time in the frame of
reference specified by this gauge. Back reaction theories employing this sort
of gauge [1] also involve coordinate effects. The invariant theory created here
shows that the classical Lifshitz (1946) [2] gauge does not lead to
non-physical perturbations of the proper time and can be used to analyze the
inflation regime and the back reaction of perturbations on this regime
properly. The first theory of back reaction on background of all types of
perturbations (scalar, vector and tensor) based on this gauge was published in
1975 [3] and has been applied recently to the inflation [4]. The investigation
of long-length perturbations, which characterize the stability of the
inflationary process, and quantum fluctuations, which form the
Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum at the end of inflation, is performed in the
invariant form. The invariant theory proposed allows one to examine the effect
of quantum fluctuations on the inflationary stage when the periodic regime
changes to an aperiodic one. That only the invariant theory must be used to
analyze space experiments is one of the conclusions of the present work.

effective longitudinal pressure remains significantly below the lattice QCD
pressure until the plasma cools to near the confinement scale. Therefore, the
transverse energy per unit of rapidity and its dependence on beam energy
provides a sensitive test of gluon saturation models: the fractional transverse
energy loss due to final state interactions is smaller and exhibits a weaker
energy dependence than if ideal (nondissipative) hydrodynamics applied
throughout the evolution.

mechanics. Emphasis is placed on the (Schr\""odinger picture) states of the

the field operator $\hat{\psi}(x)$ (which is superfluous in this approach). The
vacuum state `at time $\tau$' is defined as the Slater determinant of a basis
for the span of the negative spectrum of the `first quantized' Hamiltonian
$\hat{H}(\tau)$, thus providing a concrete realisation of the Dirac Sea. The
general S-matrix element of the theory is derived in terms of time-dependent
Bogoliubov coefficients, demonstrating that the S-matrix follows directly from
the definition of inner product between Slater determinants. The process of
`Hermitian extension', inherited directly from conventional multiparticle
quantum mechanics, allows second quantized operators to be defined without
appealing to a complete set of orthonormal modes, and provides an extremely
straightforward derivation of the general expectation value of the theory. The
concept of `radar time', advocated by Bondi in his work on k-calculus, is used
to generalise the particle interpretation to an arbitrarily moving observer. A
definition of particle results, which depends {\it only} on the observer's
motion and the background present, not on any choice of coordinates or gauge,
or of the particle detector. We relate this approach to conventional methods by
comparing and contrasting various derivations. Our particle definition can be
viewed as a generalisation to arbitrary observers of Gibbons' approach.

two, the conditions (1) $V$ is ACM, and (2) $V$ is ""licci"" (i.e. $V$ is in the

codimension, (2) implies (1) but the converse is false. For Gorenstein liaison
the analog of (2) is: $(2')$ $V$ is ""glicci"" (i.e. $V$ is in the Gorenstein
liaison class of a complete intersection). It remains true that $(2')$ implies
(1) but now the converse is an important open question.
  Previously the authors described a mechanism for lifting monomial ideals to
reduced unions of linear varieties. We show here that if the monomial ideal is
Artinian then the corresponding union is glicci. As a consequence, any Hilbert
function that occurs among ACM schemes in fact occurs among glicci schemes.
This is not true if we restrict to complete intersection links. We also show
that any Cohen-Macaulay Borel-fixed monomial ideal is glicci. As a consequence,
all ACM subschemes of projective space are glicci up to flat deformation.

foundation for these objects by exhibiting their symmetry properties, their
intimate ties with the symmetry groups of their domains of definition, and
subsequently their decomposition into irreducible parts and algebraic
classification theory. In a first part we recall the characterisation of the
family of self-scaled cones as the set of symmetric cones and develop a
primal-dual symmetric viewpoint on self-scaled barriers, results that were
first discovered by the second author. We then show in a short, simple proof
that any pointed, convex cone decomposes into a direct sum of irreducible

We then show that any self-scaled barrier function decomposes in an essentially
unique way into a direct sum of self-scaled barriers defined on the irreducible
components of the underlying symmetric cone. Finally, we present a complete
algebraic classification of self-scaled barrier functions using the

As this equation is very cumbersome, we also study, in parallel to it, its
simplified version which keeps the most essential term: the term which accounts
for the {\it nonlinear diffraction}. The full equation additionally includes
terms generated by a deviation from the paraxial approximation and by a
longitudinal electric-field component in the beam. Solitary-wave stationary
solutions to both the full and simplified equations are found, treating the
terms which modify the nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation as perturbations.
Within the framework of the perturbative approach, a conserved power of the
beam is obtained in an explicit form. It is found that the nonlinear
diffraction affects stationary beams much stronger than nonparaxiality and
longitudinal field. Stability of the beams is directly tested by simulating the
simplified equation, with initial configurations taken as predicted by the
perturbation theory. The numerically generated solitary beams are always stable
and never start to collapse, although they display periodic internal
vibrations, whose amplitude decreases with the increase of the beam power.

paradoxes which are solved by a careful analysis of what is a truly
self-adjoint operator. We then describe the self-adjoint extensions and their
spectra for the momentum and the Hamiltonian operators in different physical
situations. Some consequences are worked out, which could lead to experimental
checks.
