43 GHz made with the Very Large Array at approximately 0.5 arcsec resolution.
The SiO emission appears to trace primarily internal bowshocks in the outflow,
suggesting that the dust and molecular gas are accelerated via prompt
entrainment at internal working surfaces in the jet. There is also some
evidence for limb-brightening of the SiO emission, indicating that SiO emission
may also arise from entrainment in the jet's boundary layer. Excitation
temperatures of >~150-200 K are inferred from the SiO emission. Enhancements in
the SiO abundance of ~10^6 over interstellar values are observed, and the
possible origin of the SiO is discussed.

photons. In other cases, such as supernova remnants, gamma ray bursters, and
active galaxies, all of which may involve compact objects or black holes at

  Eliminated implication that ratio of column length to correlation length

  unresolved. Added discussion of dependence of autocorrelation function with
  parameters of the turbulence",,"10.1086/321688",,"astro-ph",,"  (Abridged) We discuss the probability distribution function (PDF) of column
density resulting from density fields with lognormal PDFs, applicable to
isothermal gas (e.g., probably molecular clouds). We suggest that a
``decorrelation length'' can be defined as the distance over which the density
auto-correlation function has decayed to, for example, 10% of its zero-lag
value, so that the density ``events'' along a line of sight can be assumed to
be independent over distances larger than this, and the Central Limit Theorem
should be applicable. However, using random realizations of lognormal fields,
we show that the convergence to a Gaussian is extremely slow in the high-
density tail. Thus, the column density PDF is not expected to exhibit a unique
functional shape, but to transit instead from a lognormal to a Gaussian form as
the ratio $\eta$ of the column length to the decorrelation length increases.
Simultaneously, the PDF's variance decreases. For intermediate values of
$\eta$, the column density PDF assumes a nearly exponential decay. We then
discuss the density power spectrum and the expected value of $\eta$ in actual
molecular clouds. Observationally, our results suggest that $\eta$ may be
inferred from the shape and width of the column density PDF in
optically-thin-line or extinction studies. Our results should also hold for gas
with finite-extent power-law underlying density PDFs, which should be
characteristic of the diffuse, non-isothermal neutral medium (temperatures
ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand degrees). Finally, we note that
for $\eta \gtrsim 100$, the dynamic range in column density is small
($\lesssim$ a factor of 10), but this is only an averaging effect, with no
implication on the dynamic range of the underlying density distribution.

been known to provide a natural explanation for the origin of stellar

timescales are comparable. We present models which invoke simultaneous star
formation, viscous redistribution of gas and cosmologically-motivated gaseous
infall and explore the predictions such models make for the scale length
evolution and radial star formation history of galactic stellar discs. While
the inclusion of viscous flows is essential for ensuring that the stellar disc
is always exponential over a significant range in radius, we find that such
flows play essentially no role in determining the evolution of the disc scale
length. In models in which the main infall phase precedes the onset of star
formation and viscous evolution, we find the exponential scale length to be
rather invariant with time. On the other hand, models in which star
formation/viscous evolution and infall occur concurrently result in a smoothly
increasing scale length with time, reflecting the mean angular momentum of
material which has fallen in at any given epoch. The disc stellar populations
in these models are predominantly young (ie. ages < 5 Gyr) beyond a few scale
lengths. In both cases, viscous flows are entirely responsible for transporting
material to very large radii. We discuss existing observational constraints on
these models from studies of both local and moderate redshift disc galaxies. In
particular, a good agreement is found between the solar neighbourhood star
formation history predicted by our infall model and the recent observational
determination of this quantity by Rocha-Pinto et al (2000).

no relativistic extension, and so makes no firm lensing predictions, but
galaxy-galaxy lensing data can be used to empirically the deflection law of a

the deflection experienced by a photon is twice that experienced by a massive

both discrete and continuously varying features.Moreover, the gaussian
approximation implies negative firing rates, which is biologically implausible.

renormalization of the noise parameter. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of
averaging the distribution across the discrete dimension, evaluating the mutual

interest. Fluorescence occurs when electrons drop from one level to another
without changing spin. Only electron gases in a state of equilibrium are
considered. When the system may exchange electrons with a large reservoir, the
electron-gas fluorescence is easily obtained from the well-known Fermi-Dirac
distribution. But this is not so when the number of electrons in the system is
prevented from varying, as is the case for isolated systems and for systems
that are in thermal contact with electrical insulators such as diamond. Our
accurate expressions rest on the assumption that single-electron energy levels
are evenly spaced, and that energy coupling and spin coupling between electrons
are small. These assumptions are shown to be realistic for many systems.
Fluorescence from short, nearly isolated, quantum wires is predicted to drop
abruptly in the visible, a result not predicted by the Fermi-Dirac
distribution. Our exact formulas are based on restricted and unrestricted
partitions of integers. The method is considerably simpler than the ones
proposed earlier, which are based on second quantization and contour
integration.

is developed that unifies ballistic and diffusive transport and thus
generalizes the Drude model. The unified model is valid for arbitrary magnitude

Universal formulas are obtained for the current-voltage characteristic in the
nondegenerate case and for the zero-bias conductance in the degenerate case,
which describe in a transparent manner the interplay of ballistic and diffusive
transport. The semiclassical approach is adopted, but quantum corrections
allowing for tunneling are included. Examples are considered, in particular the
case of chains of grains in polycrystalline or microcrystalline semiconductors
with grain size comparable to, or smaller than, the mean free path. Substantial
deviations of the results of the unified model from those of the ballistic
thermionic-emission model and of the drift-diffusion model are found. The
formulation of the model is one-dimensional, but it is argued that its results

(LTLRR), decreased from 10 K to 150 K and increased from 150 K to 195 K in
La0.5Ca0.5MnO3. This change in behavior was found to be related to the complete
suppression of the antiferromagnetic phase above 150 K and in the presence of a
5 T magnetic field. At 195 K, the magnetization first decreased, and after a
few minutes increased slowly as a function of time. Moreover, between 200 K and
245 K, the magnetization increased throughout the measured time span. The
change in the slope of the curves, from negative to positive at about 200 K was
found to be related to the suppression of antiferromagnetic fluctuations in
small magnetic fields. A similar temperature dependence of the LTLRR was found
for the Nd0.5Sr0.5MnO3 sample. However, the temperature where the LTLRR reached
the minimum in Nd0.5Sr0.5MnO3 was lower than that of La0.5Ca0.5MnO3. This
result agrees with the stronger ferromagnetic interactions that exist in

suggested that the general temperature dependence of the LTLRR and the
underlying physics were mainly independent of the particular charge ordering
system considered. All relaxation curves could be fitted using a logarithmic
law at long times. This slow relaxation was attributed to the coexistence of
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions between Mn ions, which
produced a distribution of energy barriers.

integrable submodels of the nonlinear Grassmann models in any dimension. We
call them the Grassmann submodels. To show that our submodels are integrable,
we construct an infinite number of conserved currents in two ways. One is that
we make full use of the Noether currents of the nonlinear Grassmann models. The
other is that we use a method of multiplier. Next we investigate symmetries of
the Grassmann submodel. By using the symmetries, we can construct a wide class
of exact solutions for our submodels. In part III, keeping some properties of
our submodels, we generalize our submodels to higher-order equations. First we
prepare the Bell polynomials and the generalized Bell polynomials which play
the most important roles in our theory of generalized submodels. Next we
generalize the $\mathbf{C}P^1$-submodel to higher-order equations. Lastly we
generalize the Grassmann submodel to higher-order equations. By using the
generalized Bell polynomials, we can show that the generalized Grassmann
submodels are also integrable. As a result, we obtain a hierarchy of systems of
integrable equations in any dimension which includes Grassmann submodels. These
results lead to the conclusion that the integrable structures of our

residues form a subgroup F_k with |F_k|=|G_k|/p. The subgroup of order p-1, the
core A_k of G_k, extends Fermat's Small Theorem (FST) to mod p^{k>1},
consisting of p-1 residues with n^p = n mod p^k. The concept of ""carry"", e.g.
n' in FST extension n^{p-1} = n'p+1 mod p^2, is crucial in expanding residue
arithmetic to integers, and to allow analysis of divisors of 0 mod p^k. . . . .

nonzero pairsums of core residues are shown to be distinct, upto commutation.
The known FLT case_1 is related to this, and the set F_k + F_k mod p^k of p-th

canonical (weak) $V\otimes V$-modules called ${\cal{D}}_{Q(z)}(W)$ parametrized
by a nonzero complex number $z$. We prove that for $V$-modules $W,W_{1}$ and
$W_{2}$, a $Q(z)$-intertwining map of type ${W'\choose W_{1}W_{2}}$ in the
sense of Huang and Lepowsky exactly amounts to a $V\otimes V$-homomorphism from
$W_{1}\otimes W_{2}$ to ${\cal{D}}_{Q(z)}(W)$ and that a $Q(z)$-tensor product
of $V$-modules $W_{1}$ and $W_{2}$ in the sense of Huang and Lepowsky amounts
to a universal from $W_{1}\otimes W_{2}$ to the functor ${\cal{F}}_{Q(z)}$,
where ${\cal{F}}_{Q(z)}$ is a functor from the category of $V$-modules to the
category of weak $V\otimes V$-modules defined by
${\cal{F}}_{Q(z)}(W)={\cal{D}}_{Q(z)}(W')$ for a $V$-module $W$. Furthermore,
Huang-Lepowsky's $P(z)$ and $Q(z)$-tensor functors for the category of
$V$-modules are extended to functors $T_{P(z)}$ and $T_{Q(z)}$ from the
category of $V\otimes V$-modules to the category of $V$-modules. It is proved
that functors ${\cal{F}}_{P(z)}$ and ${\cal{F}}_{Q(z)}$ are right adjoints of
$T_{P(z)}$ and $T_{Q(z)}$, respectively.

require the time from about square root to logarithm of the time of classical

the time required for distinguishing two devices with the same given spectrum

violation of a generalized form of Zukowski's teleportation inequality can only
occur if the channel state, considered by itself, violates a Bell-CHSH
inequality. On the other hand, although it is sufficient for a teleportation
process to have a nonclassical fidelity-defined as a fidelity exceeding
2/3-that the channel state employed violate a Bell-CHSH inequality, we show
that such a violation does not imply a violation of Zukowski's teleportation
inequality or any of its generalizations. The implication does hold, however,
if the fidelity of the teleportation exceeds $2/3(1+1/2\sqrt{2})\approx .90$,
suggesting the existence of a regime of nonclassical values of the fidelity,
less than .90, for which the standard teleportation protocol can be modelled by
local hidden variables.

explanation for such correlations. Measurement-type interactions lead, not to
many worlds but, rather, to many local copies of experimental systems and the
observers who measure their properties. Transformations of the
Heisenberg-picture operators corresponding to the properties of these systems
and observers, induced by measurement interactions, ""label"" each copy and
provide the mechanism which, e.g., ensures that each copy of one of the
observers in an EPRB or GHZM experiment will only interact with the ""correct""
copy of the other observer(s). The conceptual problem of nonlocality is thus
replaced with a conceptual problem of proliferating labels, as correlated
systems and observers undergo measurement-type interactions with
newly-encountered objects and instruments; it is suggested that this problem
