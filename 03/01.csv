wide range of initial conditions, including the initial spin, the total mass of
the halo, the redshift of virialization, the power spectrum of the DM

in the simulation. We find characteristic values for the temperature, T ~ a few
100 K, and the density, n ~ 10^3-10^4 cm^-3, characterising the gas at the end
of the initial free-fall phase. These values are rather insensitive to the
initial conditions. The corresponding Jeans mass is M_J ~ 10^3 M_sun. The
existence of these characteristic values has a robust explanation in the
microphysics of H2 cooling, connected to the minimum temperature that can be
reached with the H2 coolant, and to the critical density at which the
transition takes place betweeb levels being populated according to NLTE, and
according to LTE.
  In all cases, the gas dissipatively settles into an irregular, central
configuration which has a filamentary and knotty appearance. The fluid regions
with the highest densities are the first to undergo runaway collapse due to
gravitational instability, and to form clumps with initial masses ~ 10^3 M_sun,

the empirical Nuker function, which proves to be an adequate representation of
the surface-brightness profile for most early-type galaxies. The accurate
modeling of the bulge light allows us to obtain the magnitude of the unresolved

Our classification of early-type galaxies into core-type and power-law galaxies
agrees with the results from previous work based on HST optical images, with
core profiles occurring in luminous galaxies and power-law profiles occurring
in low-luminosity galaxies with disky isophotes. We do not find a clear
dichotomy in the distribution of inner slopes. Unresolved nuclear point sources
are evident in about one-third of the sample galaxies, with H magnitudes in the

encounters between binaries and single stars or other binaries provide a very
significant energy source for the cluster. These dynamical interactions also
lead to the production of large numbers of exotic systems such as ultracompact

Instead the evolution time scale is reproduced in stellar models by making the

chemical appearance, in particular the high lithium abundance and the short
time scale of only a few years on which the transition from the dwarf
configuration into the born again giant appearance has occurred. A new
nucleosynthesis mode of hot hydrogen-deficient He3 burning can explain the
extraordinary lithium abundance. During the thermal pulse He3 is ingested from
the envelope together with the protons into the hot He-flash convection zone.
The first network calculations show that due to the large C12 abundance protons
are rather captured by carbon than destroy newly formed Be7 and ultimately Li7.
Moreover, the short evolution time scale has been reproduced by making the
assumption that the convective efficiency for element mixing is smaller by two
to three orders of magnitude than predicted by the mixing-length theory. As a
result the main energy generation from fast convective proton capture will
occur at a larger mass coordinate, closer to the surface and the expansion to

darker than $1{MJy}{\rm sr}^{-1}$ for observations in the ecliptic plane at
$5{\rm AU}$, and 83% is darker than $0.1{\rm MJy}{\rm sr}^{-1}$. At $1{\rm

common with the observed G-band bright points. In particular, the contrast
referred to the quiet Sun is about twice the contrast in continuum wavelengths.
The agreement with observations does not depend on the specificities of the

Magnetic Atmospheres. However, the agreement requires that the real G-band
bright points are not spatially resolved, even in the best observations. Since
the predicted G-band intensities exceed by far the observed values, we foresee
a notable increase of contrast of the G-band images upon improvement of the
angular resolution. According to the LTE modeling, the G-band spectrum emerges
from the deep photosphere that produces the continuum. Our syntheses also
predict solar magnetic concentrations showing up in continuum images but not in
the G-band . Finally, we have examined the importance of the CH
photo-dissociation in setting the amount of G-band absorption. It turns out to
play a minor role.

nature of crack growth and nucleation. Bringing a field theory point of view to
fracture illuminates things in what I hope will be an entertaining way.
  Formally, what is the crack nucleation rate? Fracture is an instability of
elastic theory under tension. For thermally nucleated cracks, there is an
analogy with supercooled liquids. Here the crack nucleation rate can be thought
of as an imaginary part of the free energy - giving the decay rate of the
metastable, stretched material. As an amusing consequence, we can formally
calculate the asymptotic form for the high-order nonlinear elastic
coefficients, and explicitly show that elastic theory has zero radius of
convergence.
  Formally, can we derive the the crack growth laws from symmetry? We can
describe mixed-mode three-dimensional fracture as a moving curve in space,
decorated with a description of the local crack plane, and driven by the stress
intensity factors along the crack. Imposing the symmetries gives us the form of
the crack growth laws in two dimensions, explaining the (well-known) fact that
cracks under shear (mode II) abruptly turn until the stress becomes purely
extensional (mode I). The form of the crack growth law in three dimensions will
be derived, and linear stability analysis for mixed-mode fracture will be
briefly summarized, with connection to factory-roof morphologies.

as a U(1) gauge field, $A_i$. The charge-spin separation occurs below certain

phase develops as the Higgs phase of the gauge-field dynamics, and $A_i$
acquires a mass $m_A$. The effective field theory near $T_{\rm SG}$ takes the
form of Ginzburg-Landau theory of a complex scalar field $\lambda$ coupled with
$A_i$, where $\lambda$ represents d-wave pairings of spinons. Three
dimensionality of the system is crucial to realize a phase transition at

  By using this field theory, we calculate the dc resistivity $\rho$. At $T >
T_{\rm SG}$, $\rho$ is proportional to $T$. At $T < T_{\rm SG}$, it deviates
downward from the $T$-linear behavior as $\rho \propto T \{1 -c(T_{\rm SG}-T)^d

of the phase of the field $\lambda$, the exponent $d$ deviates from its
mean-field value 1/2 and becomes a nonuniversal quantity which depends on

superconductors with weak point pinning disorder is outlined. We propose that
the ``Bragg glass'' phase generically transforms via two separate thermodynamic
phase transitions into a disordered liquid on increasing the temperature. The
first transition is into a glassy phase, topologically disordered at the
largest length scales; current evidence suggests that it lacks the long-ranged
phase correlations expected of a ``vortex glass''. This phase has a significant
degree of short-ranged translational order, unlike the disordered liquid, but
no quasi-long range order, in contrast to the Bragg glass. This glassy phase,
which we call a ``multi-domain glass'', is confined to a narrow sliver at
intermediate fields, but broadens out both for much larger and much smaller
field values. The multi-domain glass may be a ``hexatic glass''; alternatively,
its glassy properties may originate in the replica symmetry breaking envisaged
in recent theories of the structural glass transition. Estimates for
translational correlation lengths in the multi-domain glass indicate that they
can be far larger than the interline spacing for weak disorder, suggesting a
plausible mechanism by which signals of a two-step transition can be obscured.
Calculations of the Bragg glass-multi-domain glass and the multi-domain
glass-disordered liquid phase boundaries are presented and compared to
experimental data. We argue that these proposals provide a unified picture of
the available experimental data on both high-T$_c$ and low-T$_c$ materials,
simulations and current theoretical understanding.

perpendicular rolls in Rayleigh-B\'enard convection above onset. The problem is
treated either analytically from the corresponding amplitude equations, or
numerically by solving the Swift-Hohenberg equation. We find that if the rolls
are curved by a slow transversal modulation, a net translation of the boundary
follows. We show analytically that although this motion is a nonlinear effect,
it occurs in a time scale much shorter than that of the linear relaxation of
the curved rolls. The total distance traveled by the boundary scales as
$\epsilon^{-1/2}$, where $\epsilon$ is the reduced Rayleigh number. We obtain
analytical expressions for the relaxation rate of the modulation and for the
time dependent traveling velocity of the boundary, and especially their
dependence on wavenumber. The results agree well with direct numerical
solutions of the Swift-Hohenberg equation. We finally discuss the implications
of our results on the coarsening rate of an ensemble of differently oriented
domains in which grain boundary motion through curved rolls is the dominant
coarsening mechanism.

bounds on \tan\beta and m_{1/2}, while the lower bound on a_{\mu} gives rise to
an upper bounds on m_{1/2}. These bounds are sensitive to A_0, e.g. for m_h >
114 GeV, the 95% C.L. is \tan\beta > 7(5) for A_0 = 0(-4m_{1/2}), and for m_h >
120 GeV, \tan\beta > 15(10). The positive sign of the a_{\mu} deviation implies
\mu > 0, eliminating the extreme cancellations in the dark matter
neutralino-proton detection cross section so that almost all the SUSY parameter
space should be accessible to future planned detectors. Most of the allowed
parts of parameter space occur in the co-annihilation region where m_0 is
strongly correlated with m_{1/2}. The lower bound on a_{\mu} then greatly
reduces the allowed parameter space. Thus using 90% C. L. bounds on a_{\mu} we
find for A_0 = 0 that \tan\beta \geq 10 and for \tan\beta \leq 40 that m_{1/2}

symmetry-restoring counterterms to all trilinear interactions. In order to
obtain unique results it is crucial to use the Slavnov-Taylor identity, which
does not only contain supersymmetric and gauge Ward identities but also
describes the symmetry algebra. In dimensional regularization this procedure
yields unique non-zero values for the counterterms. In contrast, in dimensional
reduction we find that no non-symmetric counterterms are needed, neither for
the symmetry transformations nor for the physical interactions. For the

not describe strings on quotient spaces, but rather seem to describe strings on
objects called quotient stacks, a result that follows from simply unraveling
definitions, and is further justified by a number of results. Quotient stacks
are very closely related to quotient spaces; for example, when the orbifold
group acts freely, the quotient space and the quotient stack are homeomorphic.
We explain how sigma models on quotient stacks naturally have twisted sectors,
and why a sigma model on a quotient stack would be a nonsingular CFT even when
the associated quotient space is singular. We also show how to understand twist
fields in this language, and outline the derivation of the orbifold Euler
characteristic purely in terms of stacks. We also outline why there is a sense
in which one naturally finds B nonzero on exceptional divisors of resolutions.
These insights are not limited to merely understanding existing string
orbifolds: we also point out how this technology enables us to understand
orbifolds in M-theory, as well as how this means that string orbifolds provide
the first example of an entirely new class of string compactifications. As
quotient stacks are not a staple of the physics literature, we include a
lengthy tutorial on quotient stacks.

geometric conception and a new T-geometric one are considered. T-geometry is
built only on the basis of information included in the metric (distance between
two points). Such geometric concepts as dimension, manifold, metric tensor,
curve are fundamental in the Riemannian conception of geometry, and they are
derivative in the T-geometric one. T-geometry is the simplest geometric
conception (essentially only finite point sets are investigated) and
simultaneously it is the most general one. It is insensitive to the space
continuity and has a new property -- nondegeneracy. Fitting the T-geometry
metric with the metric tensor of Riemannian geometry, one can compare
geometries, constructed on the basis of different conceptions. The comparison
shows that along with similarity (the same system of geodesics, the same
metric) there is a difference. There is an absolute parallelism in T-geometry,
but it is absent in the Riemannian geometry. In T-geometry any space region is
isometrically embeddable in the space, whereas in Riemannian geometry only
convex region is isometrically embeddable. T-geometric conception appears to be
more consistent logically, than the Riemannian one.

density varies on scale t^{1/d}.The optimal strategy is such that t^-1/d W^a(t)
is delocalised in the limit as t->infty.This is markedly different from the
optimal strategy for large deviations |W^a(t)|<=f(t) with f(t)=o(t),where
W^a(t) is known to fill completely a ball of volume f(t) and nothing outside,so
that W^a(t) has no holes and f(t)^{-1/d}W^a(t) is localised in the limit as

that I^{kappa_a} has an infinite slope at kappa_a and,remarkably,for d>=5 is
nonanalytic at some critical point in (0,kappa_a),above which it follows a pure
power law.This crossover is associated with a collapse transition in the
optimal strategy.We also derive the analogous moderate deviation result for
d=2.In this case E|W^a(t)|~2pi t/log t (t->infty),and we prove that

superpositions, consisting of 1000 eigenstates, is followed through
two-dimensional images. The first- and second-order coherences are captured

provided by time integrated detection projects out single ro-vibronic
transitions, while time-gated detection allows the projection of arbitrary

the control and imaging of chemistry, the controlled manipulation of massive
quantum coherences suggests the possibility of quantum computing. We argue that
the universal logic gates necessary for arbitrary quantum computing - all
single qubit operations and the two-qubit controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate - are
available in time resolved four-wave mixing in a molecule. The molecular
rotational manifold is naturally ""wired"" for carrying out all single qubit
