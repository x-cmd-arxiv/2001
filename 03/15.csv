Paschen-alpha) images of the circumnuclear starburst rings in two nearby spiral
galaxies, NGC 1512 and NGC 5248, obtained with WFPC2 and NICMOS on HST.
Combined with HST images at 2300 Ang, these data provide a particularly wide
wavelength range with which to study the properties of the stellar populations,
the gas, and the dust in the rings. Some large (50-pc scale) line emitting
regions have little associated continuum emission, but a Pa equivalent width
indicating a few-Myr-old embedded stellar population. The Ha/Pa intensity
ratios suggest the gas is mixed with dust, making it effective at obscuring
some of the young clusters. We identify about 1000 compact continuum sources
(super star clusters and individual stars) and analyze their spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) from 0.2 to 1.6 micron by fitting them with a grid of
spectral synthesis models with a range of ages and extinctions. Most of the
visible clusters are only mildly reddened, with A_V=0 to 1 mag, suggesting that
the processes that clear out the gas and dust of the stellar birth clouds are
efficient and fast. The patchiness of the dust distribution makes it difficult
to estimate reliably the star formation rate, based on UV continuum slope or
hydrogen emission-line ratios. The cluster SEDs are consistent with a range in
ages, from 1 Myr to 300 Myr, but with only a minority older than a few tens of
Myr. However, after accounting for an age bias, the fraction of old clusters is
consistent with continuous star formation in the rings over the past ~300 Myr.
Some of the brightest young clusters have excess emission in the IR that may be
radiation by circumstellar dust. The cluster mass functions follow an m^-2
power-law distribution, distinct from those of old globular clusters.

  Journal",,"10.1086/323223",,"astro-ph",,"  Relativistic binary pulsars, such as B1534+12 and B1913+16 are characterized
by having close orbits with a binary separation of ~ 3 R_\sun. The progenitor
of such a system is a neutron star, helium star binary. The helium star, with a
strong stellar wind, is able to spin up its compact companion via accretion.
The neutron star's magnetic field is then lowered to observed values of about
10^{10} Gauss. As the pulsar lifetime is inversely proportional to its magnetic
field, the possibility of observing such a system is, thus, enhanced by this
type of evolution. We will show that a nascent (Crab-like) pulsar in such a
system can, through accretion-braking torques (i.e. the ""propeller effect"") and
wind-induced spin-up rates, reach equilibrium periods that are close to
observed values. Such processes occur within the relatively short helium star
lifetimes. Additionally, we find that the final outcome of such evolutionary
scenarios depends strongly on initial parameters, particularly the initial
binary separation and helium star mass. It is, indeed, determined that the
majority of such systems end up in the pulsar ""graveyard"", and only a small
fraction are strongly recycled. This fact might help to reconcile theoretically
expected birth rates with limited observations of relativistic binary pulsars.

responsible for neutron-capture synthesis and the progenitors of the halo

show that the heaviest neutron-capture elements (including Ba and heavier) are
consistent with a scaled solar system r-process abundance distribution, while
the lighter such elements do not conform to the solar pattern. These
comparisons suggest two r-process sites or at least two different sets of
astrophysical conditions. The large star-to-star scatter observed in the
neutron-capture/iron ratios at low metallicities -- which disappears with
increasing [Fe/H] -- suggests an early, chemically unmixed and inhomogeneous
Galaxy. The stellar abundances indicate a change from the r-process to the slow

that the present data are consistent with such an interpretation. The sources
have FIR luminosities indicating the presence of B2.5 to O8.5V0 stars, are
associated with dense gas and dust, have (sub-)mm continuum spectra indicating
temperatures of ca. 30K, and have no detectable radio continuum emission. All
observed sources are associated with well-defined molecular clumps. Masses,
sizes, and other parameters depend on the tracer used, but typically the cores
have average diameters of ca. 0.5-1 pc, and masses of a few tens to a few
thousand solar masses. Compared to a similar analysis of sources which are
mostly identifyable with UC HII regions, the present sample has molecular
clumps that are more massive, larger, cooler, and less turbulent. They also
tend to have a smaller ratio of virial-to-luminous mass, indicating they are
less dynamically stable than their counterparts embedded in the UC HII-like
sources. The large sizes suggest these clumps should still undergo substantial
contraction. The lower temperatures and small linewidths are also expected in
objects in an earlier evolutionary state. We find that the masses of the
molecular clumps associated with our objects increase with Lfir [M(clump)
propto Lfir^(1.17)], and that there is a (weak) relation between the clump mass
and the mass of the embedded protostellar object M(proto) propto

regions absorbs significant amount of Lyman continuum photons directly. To
examine the second issue, we approximate $f$ to a function of only the
dust-to-gas mass ratio (i.e., metallicity), assuming a parameter fit for the
Galactic H {\sc ii} regions. We find that a characteristic $\hat{f}$, which is
defined as $f$ averaged over a galaxy-wide scale, is 0.3 for the nearby spiral
galaxies. This relatively small $\hat{f}$ indicates that a typical increment
factor due to LCE for estimating the global SFR ($1/\hat{f}$) is large ($\sim
3$) for the nearby spiral galaxies. Therefore, we conclude that the effect of
LCE is not negligible relative to other uncertainties of estimating the SFR of
galaxies.

followed by long (~ 100 s) softer tails of hard X-rays, modulated on the
stellar rotation period. Prototypical MFs could have been detected by BATSE out
to ~ 13 Mpc, nearly reaching the Virgo cluster. The likely number of isotropic,
standard-candle MFs detected by the BATSE experiment is ~ 12. Bayes' Theorem
implies that there is a 99% chance for at least 1 MF in the BATSE catalog, and
a 16% chance for more than 20. These short-duration, fast-rising gamma-ray
bursts could in principle be identified by their positional coincidences with
nearby galaxies. The ensuing soft tail emission would not have been detected by
BATSE for sources more distant than M31.
  It is possible that MFs also emit an intense, hard, BEAMED component during
the intial spike phase. If this beamed component has opening angle ~ 8 degrees
and peak luminosity comparable to the power of the isotropic component, then
BATSE would detect such beamed sources out to redshift z ~ 0.1, at a full-sky

studied, the appearance of the SN envelope also changed markedly with
wavelength. At visible wavelengths (lambda ~ 5000 Angstrom) the ejecta became
progressively more elongated, reaching an ellipticity epsilon ~ 0.25 by day

radio-quiet quasars with M_V < -23.5 are virtually all massive elliptical
galaxies. The masses of these spheroids are as expected given the relationship
between black-hole and spheroid mass found for nearby quiescent galaxies, as is
the growing prevalence of disc components in the hosts of progressively fainter
AGN. There is also now compelling evidence that quasar hosts are practically
indistinguishable from normal ellipticals, both in their basic structural
parameters and in the old age of their dominant stellar populations; at low z
the nuclear activity is not associated with the formation of a significant
fraction of the host galaxy. While the long-held view that quasar radio power
might be a simple function of host morphology is now dead and buried, I argue
that host-galaxy studies may yet play a crucial role in resolving the
long-standing problem of the origin of radio loudness. Specifically there is
growing evidence that radio-loud objects are powered by more massive black
holes accreting at lower efficiency than their radio-quiet couterparts of
comparable optical output. A black-hole mass > 10^9 solar masses appears to be
a necessary (although perhaps not sufficient) condition for the production of
radio jets of sufficient power to produce an FRII radio source within a massive

investigate the location of star formation activity through the history of the
Universe. This approach is motivated by the following: (i) GRBs are thought to
be associated with the deaths of massive stars and so the GRB rate ought to
follow the massive star formation rate, (ii) GRBs are the final evolutionary
phase of these short-lived stars, which do not travel far from their
birthplace, and so should be located where the stars formed, and (iii) The
differential effects of dust extinction on GRB afterglows between the X-ray and
optical wavebands can reveal whether or not large amounts of gas and dust are
present in GRB host galaxies. From recent evidence, we estimate that a
significant fraction (about 75%) of stars in the Universe formed in galaxies
that are brightest at rest-frame far-infrared (IR) wavelengths. This value is
marginally consistent with observations: 60 +/- 15% of GRBs have no detected
optical afterglow, whereas almost all have an X-ray afterglow. If the X-ray
afterglows of a large number of GRBs disappear at soft X-ray wavelengths (<2
keV), then this would provide strong evidence for dominant heavily obscured
star-formation activity. Far-IR and submillimetre studies of GRB hosts would
also test this idea: about 20% of hosts should be detectable using SCUBA.

metal-poor stars. The interesting trends of the observed ratios [Zn, Co, Mn,
Cr, V/Fe] can be related to the variation of the relative mass of the complete
and incomplete Si-burning regions in supernova ejecta. We find that [Zn/Fe] is
larger for deeper mass-cuts, smaller neutron excess, and larger explosion
energies. The large [Zn/Fe] and [O/Fe] observed in the very metal-poor halo
stars suggest deep mixing of complete Si-burning material and a significant
amount of fall-back in Type II supernovae. Furthermore, large explosion
energies (E_51 >~ 2 for M ~ 13 Msun and E_51 >~ 20 for M >~ 20 Msun) are
required to reproduce [Zn/Fe] ~ 0.5. The observed trends of the abundance
ratios among the iron-peak elements are better explained with this high energy
(``Hypernova'') models rather than the simple ``deep'' mass-cut effect, because
the overabundance of Ni can be avoided in the hypernova models. We also present
the yields of pair-instability supernova explosions of M = 130 - 300 Msun

highest redshift object is a previously unknown quasar at z=1.2. The sample of
objects for which spectroscopy has been obtained forms a complete subsample of
the original survey with an R band magnitude limit of 19.6. We are thus able to
use accessible volume methods to determine the luminosity function. We find
that the luminosity function is close to the low redshift 12 micron luminosity
function determined by IRAS (Fang et al., 1998; Rush et al., 1993), but with a
possible excess at the highest luminosities, which also correspond to the
highest redshifts. This excess is compatible with the rapid luminosity
evolution of L ~ (1+z)^{4.5} claimed by Xu (2000) and suggested by Elbaz (1999)
on the basis of number counts. These conclusions remain tentative because of
small number statistics at the highest redshifts. Almost all of the galaxies in
this survey are emission line objects. We use the spectra to determine emission
line diagnostics for the underlying ionisation source. We find that the
majority of objects have HII region-like spectra (roughly 2/3) but there is a
significant fraction (about 1/3) that contain an AGN. This confirms suspicions
that deep mid-IR surveys will be a powerful way to find obscured AGN. Part of
the survey area has been imaged deeply by the INT Wide Field Camera. Nearly all
12 micron sources in this area have good optical identifications. The prospects

number of virtually undamped quasinormal modes (that exist for nonzero values
of the azimuthal eigenvalue m) combine in such a way that the field (as
observed at infinity) oscillates with an amplitude that decays as 1/t at late
times. This is in clear contrast with the standard late time power-law fall-off
familiar from studies of non-rotating black holes. This long-lived oscillating
``tail'' will, however, not be present for non-extreme (presumably more
astrophysically relevant) black holes, for which we find that many quasinormal
modes (individually excited to a very small amplitude) combine to give rise to
an exponentially decaying field. This result could have implications for the
detection of gravitational-wave signals from rapidly spinning black holes,
since the required theoretical templates need to be constructed from linear
combinations of many modes. Our main results are obtained analytically, but we
support the conclusions with numerical time-evolutions of the Teukolsky
equation. These time-evolutions provide an interesting insight into the notion
that the quasinormal modes can be viewed as waves trapped in the spacetime
region outside the horizon. They also suggest that a plausible mechanism for
the behaviour we observe for extreme black holes is the presence of a
``superradiance resonance cavity'' immediately outside the black hole.

elusive in simulations of lattice QCD. We study mixing between the string state

crossing. While our study does not show direct effects of internal quark loops,
our results, combined with unitarity, give clear confirmation of string

deformed theory are the ordinary smooth manifolds. The quasitriangular WZW
model is exactly solvable and it admits the chiral decomposition.Its classical
action is not invariant with respect to the left and right action of the loop
group, however it satisfies the weaker condition of the Poisson-Lie symmetry.
The structure of the deformed WZW model is characterized by several ordinary
and dynamical r-matrices with spectral parameter. They describe the q-deformed
current algebras, they enter the definition of q-primary fields and they
characterize the quasitriangular exchange (braiding) relations. Remarkably, the
symplectic structure of the deformed chiral WZW theory is cocharacterized by
the same elliptic dynamical r-matrix that appears in the Bernard generalization
of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation, with q entering the modular parameter
of the Jacobi theta functions. This reveals a tantalizing connection between
the classical q-deformed WZW model and the quantum standard WZW theory on

sections at incident pion laboratory kinetic energies from T_pi= 141.15 to
267.3 MeV is described. Data were obtained detecting the scattered pion and
recoil proton in coincidence at 12 laboratory pion angles from 55 to 155
degrees for pi+p, and six angles from 60 to 155 degrees for pi-p. Single arm
measurements were also obtained for pi+p energies up to 218.1 MeV, with the
scattered pi+ detected at six angles from 20 to 70 degrees. A flat-walled,
super-cooled liquid hydrogen target as well as solid CH2 targets were used. The
data are characterized by small uncertainties, ~1-2% statistical and ~1-1.5%
normalization. The reliability of the cross section results was ensured by
carrying out the measurements under a variety of experimental conditions to
identify and quantify the sources of instrumental uncertainty. Our lowest and
highest energy data are consistent with overlapping results from TRIUMF and
LAMPF. In general, the Virginia Polytechnic Institute SM95 partial wave
analysis solution describes our data well, but the older Karlsruhe-Helsinki PWA
solution KH80 does not.

much larger spin-orbit splitting than observed in older measurements of light
hypernuclei. Taking into account particle threshold effects and the
density-dependence of in-medium coupling constants the apparent suppression of
spin-orbit strength in light hypernuclei as well as the spin-orbit structure
observed in medium to heavy nuclei are explained in a unified manner within the
density dependent relativistic hadron field theory. It is concluded that the
most valuable information on the Lambda spin-orbit dynamics in finite nuclei
has to be extracted from medium to heavy mass nuclei.

the natural numbers in quantum mechanics is extended here to k-ary
representations of all natural numbers, and to integers and rational numbers.
Since the length L is indeterminate, representations of states and operators
using creation and annihilation operators for bosons and fermions are defined.
Emphasis is on definitions and properties of operators corresponding to the
basic operations whose properties are given by the axioms for each type of
number. The importance of the requirement of efficient implementability for
physical models of the axioms is emphasized. Based on this, successor
operations for each value of j corresponding to addition of k^{j-1} if j>0 and
k^{j} if j<0 are defined. It follows from the efficient implementability of
these successors, which is the case for all computers, that implementation of
the addition and multiplication operators, which are defined in terms of
polynomially many iterations of the successors, should be efficient. This is
not the case for definitions based on the successor for j=1 only. This is the
only successor defined in the usual axioms of arithmetic.

The discussion is based on the introduction of a pseudospin operator, which has
the same algebra as the Pauli operator, for each of the $N$ modes of a light
field. Then the Bell-CHSH (Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt) inequality is
presented for the $N$ modes, each of which has a continuous degree of freedom.
Following Mermin's argument, it is demonstrated that for $N$-mode
parity-entangled GHZ states (in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space) of the
light field, the contradictions between quantum mechanics and local realism
grow exponentially with $N$, similarly to the usual $N$-spin cases.
