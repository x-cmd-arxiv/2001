which have been suggested to be surrounded by massive rotating accretion disks.
The aim of these new observations is to study the structure and kinematics of
the molecular clumps surrounding the HCs and nearby UCHII regions at moderately
high angular resolution. Our observations reveal that the clumps within which
the HCs and UCHII regions are embedded have a complex kinematical structure.
The total mass of the clumps is estimated to be in the range 1000-3000 Msun,
consistent with previous findings. Our observations also show compelling
evidence that the clump in G29.96-0.02 is contracting onto the HC position,
suggesting that the accretion process onto the massive young stellar object
embedded in the HC is still ongoing. In these objects the kinematical structure
that we observe is also compatible with the presence of a massive rotating disk
within the HC, even though we cannot prove this suggestion with our data. The
case of G31.41+0.31 is more complicated, and our data, although consistent with
the presence of an inner disk and an infalling envelope around it, do not have
the required spatial resolution to resolve the different structures.

``enabled'' in the presence of both strong magnetic and electric fields. Our
attempt in fitting the overall optical+UV low state spectrum with single
temperature magnetic WD models remains rather unsatisfactory, indicating either
a shortcoming in the present models or a new physical process acting in AR UMa.
As a result, our estimate of the WD temperature remains somewhat uncertain,
Twd=20000+-5000K. We detect a broad emission bump centered at ~1445A and
present throughout the entire binary orbit, and a second bump near ~1650A,
which appears only near the inferior conjunction of the secondary star. These
are suggestive of low harmonic cyclotron emission produced by low-level
(M-dot~1e-13 Msun/yr) accretion onto both magnetic poles. However, there is no
evidence in the power spectrum of light variations for accretion in gas blobs.
The observed Ly alpha emission line shows a strong phase dependence with
maximum flux and redshift near orbital phase phi~0.3, strongly indicating an
origin on the trailing hemisphere of the secondary star. An additional Ly alpha
absorption feature with similar phasing as the Ly alpha emission, but a
\~700km/s blueshift could tentatively be ascribed to absorption of WD emission

Ber F stars have suffered significantly more Li depletion than their
counterparts in the Hyades. The G and early-K stars of Coma Ber have undergone
less Li depletion than those of the Hyades, but much more than that predicted

strong evidence for additional mixing and Li depletion operating in these stars

that these GCs may be metal-rich analogues of omega Cen. The low gravity
problem can be largely explained by the radiative levitation of Fe in the

levitation and the drop in HB rotation velocities at Teff ~ 11,000 K coincide
with the disappearance of surface convection. The low rotation velocities of

estimating its value from transport measurements is not very easy. In such
cases, the value of Jc, called Jcm for magnetic Jc, is usually obtained from
the measured magnetic hysteresis loop measurements by using a proper critical
state model such as Bean's model (ref. 1). However, for bulk polycrystalline
high temperature superconductors, the values of Jcm are much higher than the
values, Jct, obtained from the transport measurements. This is due to the fact
that the Jct is interrupted by weakly linked grain boundaries. However, for the
recently discovered superconductor MgB2 (ref. 2), the grain boundary effect is
negligible and these two values seem to coincide. Moreover, Jc increases
drastically with decreasing the temperature. Consequently, the critical current
densities for bulk wires can be very high, suggesting that numerous
applications for the power transport. In this letter, we report the origin of
the large current carrying capability of MgB2 based on direct measurements of
the current-voltage relation in high magnetic fields. A strong coupling between
the grains may be one reason for the absence of the weak link effect. Another
reason may be the fact that, instead of a weak pinning mechanism such as
thermally activated flux hopping, strong pinning due to a vortex glass phase is
found in this material. The vortex phase diagram obtained from transport
measurements shows that, in H-T space, a wide region below the Hc2 line is

the opposite effect, with a rigid-band like shift of E_F to below the gap. In

to $\Pi$ also. The limit program $\Pi$ is still Horn but may be infinite. In
this paper, we consider if the least Herbrand model of the limit of a given
Horn logic program sequence $\{\Pi_n\}$ equals the limit of the least Herbrand
models of each logic program $\Pi_n$. It is proved that this property is not
true in general but holds if Horn logic programs satisfy an assumption which
can be syntactically checked and be satisfied by a class of Horn logic
programs. Thus, under this assumption we can approach the least Herbrand model
of the limit $\Pi$ by the sequence of the least Herbrand models of each finite
program $\Pi_n$. We also prove that if a finite Horn logic program satisfies
this assumption, then the least Herbrand model of this program is recursive.
Finally, by use of the concept of stability from dynamical systems, we prove
that this assumption is exactly a sufficient condition to guarantee the
stability of fixed points for Horn logic programs.

study of black hole threshold phenomena for a self-gravitating, massive complex
scalar field in spherical symmetry. We construct Type I critical solutions
dynamically by tuning a one-parameter family of initial data consisting of a
boson star and a massless real scalar field, and numerically evolving this
data. The resulting critical solutions appear to correspond to boson stars on
the unstable branch, as we show via comparisons between our simulations and
perturbation theory. For low-mass critical solutions, we find small ``halos''
of matter in the tails of the solutions, and these distort the profiles which
otherwise agree with unstable boson stars. These halos seem to be artifacts of
the collisions between the original boson stars and the massless fields, and do
not appear to belong to the true critical solutions. From this study, it
appears that unstable boson stars are unstable to dispersal (``explosion'') in
addition to black hole formation. Given the similarities in macroscopic
stability between boson stars and neutron stars, we suggest that similar
phenomena could occur in models of neutron stars.

due to an equivalence principle between the absolute effects of motion and
gravitation. The scalar is also a potential for the gravity acceleration
vector. Motion is governed by an extension of the special-relativistic form of
Newton's second law. This provides a new equation for continuum dynamics, that
gives the gravitational modification of Maxwell's equations, consistent with
photon dynamics. The same effects on light rays as in GR are predicted at the

elegant and simple enough to have caused Fermat's enthusiastic remark in the
margin of his Bachet edition of Diophantus' ""Arithmetica"". It is based on an
extension of Fermat's Small Theorem (FST) to mod p^k for any k>0, and the cubic
roots of 1 mod p^k for primes p=1 mod 6. For this solution in residues the
exponent p distributes over a sum, which blocks extension to equality for
integers, providing a partial proof of FLT case1 for all p=1 mod 6. This simple
solution begs the question why it was not found earlier. Some mathematical,
historical and psychological reasons are presented. . . . . In a companion
paper, on the triplet structure of Arithmetic mod p^k, this cubic root solution
is extended to the general rootform of FLT (mod p^k) (case1), called ""triplet"".
While the cubic root solution (a^3=1 mod p^k) involves one inverse pair:
a+a^{-1} = -1 mod p^k, a triplet has three inverse pairs in a 3-loop: a+b^{-1}
= b+c^{-1} = c+a^{-1} = -1 (mod p^k) where abc = 1 (mod p^k), which reduces to
the cubic root form if a=b=c (\neq 1) mod p^k. The triplet structure is not
restricted to p-th power residues (for some p \geq 59) but applies to all
residues in the group G_k(.) of units in the semigroup of multiplication mod
p^k.

and the ``apparent'' scaling of the trend. We study how the characteristics of
these crossovers depend on (i) the slope of the linear trend; (ii) the
amplitude and period of the periodic trend; (iii) the amplitude and power of
the power-law trend and (iv) the length as well as the correlation properties
of the noise. Surprisingly, we find that the crossovers in the scaling of noisy
signals with trends also follow scaling laws -- i.e. long-range power-law
dependence of the position of the crossover on the parameters of the trends. We
show that the DFA result of noise with a trend can be exactly determined by the
superposition of the separate results of the DFA on the noise and on the trend,
assuming that the noise and the trend are not correlated. If this superposition
rule is not followed, this is an indication that the noise and the superimposed
trend are not independent, so that removing the trend could lead to changes in
the correlation properties of the noise.

inequalities for the results of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen type of experiments. We
find that the introduction of time-like random variables permits the
construction of a broader mathematical model which accounts for all
correlations of variables that are contained in the time dependent parameter
set of the backward light cone. It also permits to obtain the quantum result
for the spin pair correlation, a result that contradicts Bell's inequality. Two
key features of our mathematical model are (i) the introduction of time
operators that are indexed by the measurement settings and appear in addition
to Bell's source parameters and (ii) the related introduction of a probability
measure for all parameters that does depend on the analyzer settings. Using the
theory of B-splines, we then show that this probability measure can be
constructed as a linear combination of setting dependent subspace product
measures and that the construction guarantees Einstein-separability.

dimensions is of the order of de Broglie wavelength for cold electrons. By
using semiconductors, composed of more than one material combined with a metal
slip-gate, two-dimensional quantum tubes may be built. We present a method for
predicting the transmission of low-temperature electrons in such a tube. This
problem is mathematically related to the transmission of acoustic or
electromagnetic waves in a two-dimensional duct. The tube is asymptotically
straight with a constant cross-section. Propagation properties for complicated
tubes can be synthesised from corresponding results for more simple tubes by
the so-called Building Block Method. Conformal mapping techniques are then
applied to transform the simple tube with curvature and varying cross-section
to a straight, constant cross-section, tube with variable refractive index.
Stable formulations for the scattering operators in terms of ordinary
differential equations are formulated by wave splitting using an invariant
imbedding technique. The mathematical framework is also generalised to handle
tubes with edges, which are of large technical interest. The numerical method
consists of using a standard MATLAB ordinary differential equation solver for
the truncated reflection and transmission matrices in a Fourier sine basis. It
is proved that the numerical scheme converges with increasing truncation.

phenomenon is, that bunched and antibunched light is emitted in different
spatial directions. The calculations are performed analytically. It is pointed
out, that the correlations are induced by state reduction due to the
measurement process when the detection of the photons does not distinguish
between the atoms. It is interesting to note, that the phenomena show up even
without any interatomic interaction.

a radiatively damped atom driven by an unknown Rabi frequency $\Omega$ (as
would occur for an atom at an unknown point in a standing light wave). By
measuring the environment of the system, knowledge about the system state, and
about the uncertain dynamical parameter, can be acquired. We find that these
two sorts of knowledge acquisition (quantified by the posterior distribution
for $\Omega$, and the conditional purity of the system, respectively) are quite
distinct processes, which are not strongly correlated. Also, the quality and
quantity of knowledge gain depend strongly on the type of monitoring scheme. We
compare five different detection schemes (direct, adaptive, homodyne of the $x$
quadrature, homodyne of the $y$ quadrature, and heterodyne) using four
different measures of the knowledge gain (Shannon information about $\Omega$,
variance in $\Omega$, long-time system purity, and short-time system purity).
