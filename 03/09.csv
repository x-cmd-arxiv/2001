translucent clouds, for the line of sight toward HD 110432. This star lies
beyond the Coalsack dark nebula, and with E(B-V) = 0.40, and A_V = 1.32 this
line of sight bridges the gap between less extinguished diffuse cloud lines of
sight with A_V \sim 1, such as Zeta Oph, and the translucent clouds with A_V
\gtrsim 2 such as HD 73882. Through profile fitting and a curve-of-growth
analysis, we have derived rotational populations for H2 for J = 0--7. The line
of sight has a total molecular hydrogen column density, log N(H2) = 20.68 \pm
0.05 cm^{-2}, nearly identical to that toward Zeta Oph, but a factor of three
less than HD 73882. The ratio of N(J=1) to N(J=0) yields a kinetic temperature
T_{kin} = 63 \pm 7 K, similar to other lines of sight with A_V \gtrsim 1. The
high-J lines show considerable excitation above this temperature. The high-J
excitation is similar to that toward Zeta Oph, but much smaller than that
toward HD 73882. Chemical modeling indicates that the physical conditions in
the cloud(s) are very similar to those in the cloud(s) toward Zeta Oph. An
analysis of IUE spectra of the Lyman-alpha line gives log N(H I) = 20.85 \pm
0.15 cm^{-2}. Combined with N(H2), we derive a hydrogen molecular fraction,
f_{H2} = 0.58 pm 0.12, statistically identical to that found for the lines of
sight toward Zeta Oph and HD 73882. We also report column densities for the HD
and CO molecules. From the combined measurements of hydrogen and carbon-
containing molecules, the line of sight toward HD 110432 appears quite similar
to the diffuse cloud line of sight toward Zeta Oph, and quite dissimilar to the
translucent cloud line of sight toward HD 73882.

R and N. In this paper we discuss the results for the R stars. The most
important result is that the early R stars (i.e., R0 - R3) have absolute
magnitudes and V-K colors locating them among red clump giants in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Stars with subtypes R4 - R9 tend to be cooler and
have similar luminosity to the N-type carbon stars, as confirmed by their
position in the (J-H, H-K) color-color diagram. The sample of early R-type
stars selected from the Hipparcos Catalogue appears to be approximately
complete to magnitude K_0 ~ 7, translating into a completeness distance of 600
pc if all R stars had M_K= -2 (400 pc if M_K= -1). With about 30 early R-type
stars in that volume, they comprise about 0.04% (0.14% for M_K= -1) of the red
clump stars in the solar neighborhood. Identification with the red clump
locates these stars at the helium core burning stage of stellar evolution,
while the N stars are on the asymptotic giant branch, where helium shell
burning occurs. The present analysis suggests that for a small fraction of the
helium core burning stars (far lower than the fraction of helium shell-burning
stars), carbon produced in the interior is mixed to the atmosphere in
sufficient quantities to form a carbon star.

the spacetime by means of outgoing null hypersurfaces. The code contains an
equation of state which includes effects due to radiation, electrons and
baryons, and detailed microphysics to account for electron-positron pairs. In
addition energy losses by thermal neutrino emission are included. We are able
to follow the collapse of SMS from the onset of instability up to the point of
black hole formation. Several SMS with masses in the range $5\times 10^5
M_{\odot}- 10^9 M_{\odot}$ are simulated. In all models an apparent horizon
forms initially, enclosing the innermost 25% of the stellar mass. From the
computed neutrino luminosities, estimates of the energy deposition by
$\nu\bar{\nu}$-annihilation are obtained. Only a small fraction of this energy
is deposited near the surface of the star, where, as proposed recently by
Fuller & Shi (1998), it could cause the ultrarelativistic flow believed to be
responsible for $\gamma$-ray bursts. Our simulations show that for collapsing
SMS with masses larger than $5\times 10^5 M_{\odot}$ the energy deposition is
at least two orders of magnitude too small to explain the energetics of
observed long-duration bursts at cosmological redshifts. In addition, in the
absence of rotational effects the energy is deposited in a region containing
most of the stellar mass. Therefore relativistic ejection of matter is
impossible.

the specific heat at Tc: dTc/dp becomes zero when DeltaCp*Tc is maximal,
whereas dTc/dp has a peak at lower oxygen contents where DeltaCp*Tc vanishes.
Substituting Nd for Y and doping with Ca leads to a shift of these specific
oxygen contents, since oxygen order and hole doping by Ca influences the hole
content nh in the CuO2 planes. Calculating nh from the parabolic Tc(nh)
behavior, the features coalesce for all samples at nh=0.11 and nh=0.175,
irrespective of substitution and doping. Hence, this behavior seems to reflect
an intrinsic property of the CuO2 planes. Analyzing our results we obtain
different mechanisms in three doping regions: Tc changes in the optimally doped
and overdoped region are mainly caused by charge transfer. In the slightly
underdoped region an increasing contribution to dTc/dp is obtained when well
ordered CuO chain fragments serve as pinning centers for stripes. This behavior
is supported by our results on Zn doped NdBa2Cu3Ox and is responsible for the
well known dTc/dp peak observed in YBa2Cu3Ox at x=6.7. Going to a hole content
below nh=0.11 our results point to a crossover from an underdoped
superconductor to a doped antiferromagnet, changing completely the physics of

Pauli exclusion between their electrons and holes, criteria based on the
underlying fermionic character of the exciton should be even more relevant. Two
significant quantities are the boson departure $1- [B,B^{\dagger}]$ and boson
number $B^{\dagger} B$, where $B^{\dagger}$ is the exciton creation operator.
Their expectation values in the $N$-exciton state are close to their boson

the basis of the Hubbard model which includes only the on-site repulsive
interaction $U$. We consider the pairing scenario for the pseudogap. The
pseudogap arises from the resonance scattering due to the strong
superconducting fluctuations.
  First, the electronic state and the anti-ferromagnetic spin fluctuations are
calculated by using the FLEX approximation. The T-matrix (the propagator of the
superconducting fluctuations) is calculated by extending the $\acute{{\rm
E}}$liashberg equation. The self-energy due to the superconducting fluctuations
is calculated by the T-matrix approximation. The pseudogap is shown in the
single particle properties and the magnetic properties by the microscopic
calculation. A comprehensive explanation of the doping dependence of the
pseudogap is obtained. Furthermore, we apply the theory to the electron-doped
cuprates and obtain the consistent results with the recent experiments.
Finally, the self-consistent calculation for the spin fluctuations,
superconducting fluctuations and the single particle properties are carried out
within the FLEX and the self-consistent T-matrix approximations. The calculated
superconducting critical temperature $T_{{\rm c}}$ is remarkably reduced from
the results of the mean field (FLEX) calculation. It is shown that the critical
temperature decreases with decreasing doping in the under-doped region with
large $U$.

we discuss status of torsion in the theory of gravity. At first, we emphasize
that up to now we have no experimental evidence for the existence of torsion in
Nature. Contrary, the all experiments performed in weak gravitational field
(Solar System) or in strong regime (binary pulsars) and tests of the Einstein
Equivalence Principle ({\bf EEP}) confirmed {\bf GR} and Lorentzian manifold
$(M_4;g)$ as correct geometrical model of the physical space-time. Then, we
give theoretical arguments against introducing of torsion into geometrical
model of the physical space-time. At last, we conclude that the
general-relativistic model of the physical space-time is sufficient and it
seems to be the most satisfactory.

the simulation of peripheral and central heavy ion reactions are compared. The
experimental finding of enhancement of mid-rapidity matter shows the necessity
to include nonlocal corrections. While the in-medium cross section changes the
number of collisions and not the transferred energy, the nonlocal scenario
changes the energy transferred during collisions. The renormalisation of
quasiparticle energies by using the Pauli-rejected collisions leads to a
further enhancement of mid-rapidity matter distribution and is accompanied by a
dynamical softening of the equation of state.
  The simulation results are parameterised in terms of time dependent
thermodynamical variables in the Fermi liquid sense. This allows one to discuss
dynamical trajectories in phase space. A combination of thermodynamical
observables is constructed which locates instabilities and points of possible
phase transition under iso-nothing conditions. Two different mechanisms of
instability, a short time surface-dominated instability and later a
spinodal-dominated volume instability is found. The latter one occurs only if
the incident energies do not exceed significantly the Fermi energy and might be
attributed to spinodal decomposition.

electron Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) solitary waves, also called the BGK
phase space electron holes (EH). It is shown that the charge density variation
in the vicinity of the solitary potential is a net balance of the negative
charge from trapped electrons and positive charge due to the decrease of the
passing electron density. A BGK EH consists of electron density enhancements as
well as a density depletion, instead of only the density depletion as
previously thought. The shielding of the positive core is not a thermal
screening by the ambient plasma, but achieved by trapped electrons oscillating
inside the potential energy trough. The total charge of a BGK EH is therefore
zero. Two separated EHs do not interact and the concept of negative mass is not
needed. These features are independent of the strength of the nonlinearity. BGK
EHs do not require thermal screening, and their size is thus not restricted to
be greater than the Debye length $\lambda_D$. Our analysis predicts that BGK
EHs smaller than $\lambda_D$ can exist. A width($\delta$)-amplitude($\psi$)
relation of an inequality form is obtained for BGK EHs in general. For
empty-centered EHs with potential amplitude $\gg 1$, we show that the
width-amplitude relation of the form $\delta\propto\sqrt{\psi}$ is common to
bell-shaped potentials. For $\psi\ll 1$, the width approaches zero faster than
$\sqrt{\psi}$.

points have a specificed tensor product form. Two mathematical problems in the

von Neumann reformulated quantum theory as a theory of an evolving objective
universe interacting with human consciousness. This interaction is associated
both in Copenhagen quantum theory and in von Neumann quantum theory with a
sudden change that brings the objective physical state of a system in line with
a subjectively felt psychical reality. The objective physical state is thereby
converted from a material substrate to an informational and dispositional
substrate that carries both the information incorporated into it by the
psychical realities, and certain dispositions for the occurrence of future
psychical realities. The present work examines and proposes solutions to two
problems that have appeared to block the development of this conception of
nature. The first problem is how to reconcile this theory with the principles
of relativistic quantum field theory; the second problem is to understand
whether, strictly within quantum theory, a person's mind can affect the

resolving a certain nonlocality question. The proposed solution to the second
