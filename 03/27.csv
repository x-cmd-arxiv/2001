intermittently, accelerating shells of plasma with different mass, energy and
velocity. Faster but later shells can then catch up slower earlier ones. In the
resulting collisions shocks develop, converting some of the ordered bulk
kinetic energy into magnetic field and random energy of the electrons which
then radiate. We propose that this internal shock scenario, which is the
scenario generally thought to explain the observed gamma-ray burst radiation,
can work also for radio sources in general, and for blazar in particular. We
investigate in detail this idea, simulating the birth, propagation and
collision of shells, calculating the spectrum produced in each collision, and
summing the locally produced spectra from those regions of the jet which are
simultaneously active in the observer's frame. We can thus construct snapshots
of the overall spectral energy distribution as well as time dependent spectra
and light curves. This allows us to characterize the predicted variability at
any frequency, study correlations among the emission at different frequencies,
specify the contribution of each region of the jet to the total emission, find
correlations between flares at high energies and the birth of superluminal
radio knots and/or radio flares. The model has been applied to qualitatively
reproduce the observed properties of 3C 279. Global agreement in terms of both
spectra and temporal evolution is found. In a forthcoming work, we explore the
constraints which this scenario sets on the initial conditions of the plasma
injected in the jet and the shock dissipation for different classes of blazars.

star formation either 1-2x10^8 years after the first encounter or very late

ultraluminous activity appears to be centrally concentrated on the nucleus of

  The presence of a significant population of very young ultraluminous mergers,

substantial fraction of the merger lifetime may be spent in a phase identified

brightness dwarfs (LSBs) into dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) and high surface
brightness dwarfs (HSBs) into dwarf ellipticals (dEs) in less than 10 Gyr. The
final central velocity dispersions of the remnants are in the range 8-30 km/s
and their final $v/\sigma$ falls to values $< 0.5$, matching well the
kinematics of early-type dwarfs. The transformation requires the orbital time
of the dwarf to be $\simlt 3-4$ Gyr, which implies a halo as massive and
extended as predicted by hierarchical models of galaxy formation to explain the
origin of even the farthest dSph satellites of the Milky Way, Leo I and Leo II.
Only dwarfs with central dark matter densities as high as those of Draco and
Ursa Minor can survive for 10 Gyr in the proximity of the Milky Way: this is
naturally achieved within hierarchical models, where the densest objects should
have small orbital times due to their early formation epochs. Part of the gas

strong burst of star formation in HSBs and smaller, multiple bursts in LSBs.

throughout the Universe at a rate much higher than is detected. Since the
emission from the optical afterglow is thought to be more isotropic than the
gamma-ray emission, it has been hypothesized that a search for orphan
afterglows (those without the triggering GRB) would allow strong constraints to
be placed on the degree of GRB collimation. We show here that, within the
context of leading models of GRB jet evolution, measurement of the GRB beaming
angle using optical orphan searches is extremely difficult, perhaps impossible
in practice. This is because in the leading model of GRB jets, the effective
afterglow beaming angle scales with the jet angle for small angles, and so the
ratio of detected orphan afterglows to GRBs is independent of the jet opening
angle. Thus, the number of expected afterglow detections is the same for
moderate jet angles (e.g. 20 deg) as for arbitrarily small jet angles (<< 0.1
deg). For nearly isotropic GRB geometry, or for radio afterglow searches in
which the jet has become non-relativistic, the ratio of afterglows to GRBs may
give information on collimation. However, using a simple model we estimate the
expected number of orphan detections in current supernova surveys, and find
this number to be less than one, for all jet opening angles. Even for future
supernova surveys, the small detection rate and lack of dependence on
collimation angle appear to ruin the prospects of determining GRB beaming by
this method. Radio searches may provide the best hope to find the missing
orphans.

Blending is the close association of a Cepheid with one or more intrinsically
luminous stars. High-resolution HST images are compared to our ground-based
data, obtained as part of the DIRECT project, for a sample of 102 Cepheids in
the M33 galaxy. The average (median) flux contribution from luminous companions
not resolved on the ground-based images in the B, V and I bands (S_B, S_V, S_I)
is about 29% (15%), 24% (14%), 30% (21%) of the flux of the Cepheid. For 64
Cepheids with periods in excess of 10 days the average (median) values of S_B,
S_V, S_I are 20% (10%), 16% (7%), 23% (14%). This shows that, depending on the
sample of objects chosen, the distance derived from our ground-based V-band
magnitudes for the M33 Cepheids would be systematically underestimated by about
8%-11% (3%-6%). Using artificial star tests we study crowding and blending as
separate phenomena. These tests indicate that the effect of blending could be
more significant than crowding in regions of lower surface brightness, below
21.6 mag/arcsec^2. We also find indications that in the case of long period
Cepheids (P>10^d) companions from blending are on average bluer than companions
introduced by crowding. Our ground-based resolution in M33 corresponds to the
HST resolution at about 11 Mpc. We estimate the effect of blending at
resolutions corresponding to a range of distances as observed with the HST
using the HST M33 data as the template unblended population. We compare our
results to those obtained by other groups.

galaxies which due to observational selection effects were previously
disregarded in environmental studies of SFDGs. A subsample at low redshift,
cz<2000 km/s, was chosen to partially eliminate the observational bias against
distant dwarf companions. We find companion candidates for approximately 30% of
the objects within a projected linear separation s_p<100 kpc and a redshift
difference (Delta cz)<500 km/s. The limited completeness of the available data
sets, together with the non-negligible frequency of HI clouds in the vicinity
of SFDGs indicated by recent radio surveys, suggest that a considerably larger
fraction of these galaxies may be accompanied by low-mass systems. This casts
doubt on the hypothesis that the majority of them can be considered truly
isolated. The velocity differences between companion candidates and sample
SFDGs amount typically to (Delta cz)<250 km/s, and show a rising distribution
towards lower (Delta cz). This is similarly found for dwarf satellites of
spiral galaxies, suggesting a physical association between the companion
candidates and the sample SFDGs. SFDGs with a close companion do not show
significant differences in their Hbeta equivalent widths and B-V colours as
compared to isolated ones. However, the available data do not allow us to rule
out that interactions with close dwarf companions can influence the star
formation activity in SFDGs.

that, despite a very strong ultrasoft X-ray excess below 0.3 keV and a soft
0.3--2 keV spectral index in earlier ROSAT data, the hard X-ray spectrum
(alpha~ -0.8; 0.6-10 keV) is typical of type 1 AGN, and the soft component has
since disappeared. Optical data taken at two different epochs show that the big
blue bump is also highly variable. The strength of the ultrasoft X-ray
component and the extreme variability in RE J2248-511 are reminiscent of the
behaviour observed in many narrow line Seyfert 1s (NLS1s). However, the high
energy end of the ROSAT spectrum, the ASCA spectrum and the Balmer line full
widths at half maximum of ~3000 km/s in RE J2248-511, are typical of normal
Seyfert 1 AGN.
  The change in the soft X-ray spectrum as observed in the ROSAT and ASCA data
is consistent with the behaviour of Galactic Black Hole Candidates (GBHCs) as
they move from a high to a low state, ie. a fall in the ultrasoft component and
a hardening of the X-ray continuum. This GBHC analogy has also been proposed
for NLS1s. Alternatively, the variability may be caused by opacity changes in a
hot, optically-thin corona which surrounds a cold, dense accretion disc; this
was first suggested by Guainazzi et al. for 1H0419-577, an object which shows
remarkably similar properties to RE J2248-511.

depolarization in the cores of AGN which reduces linear polarization but leaves
circular polarization unchanged. In comparing ours and other recent results to

high-redshift galaxies via optical spectroscopy, contains sufficient
information to allow the degeneracy between age and metallicity to be lifted.
We do this by testing the ability of evolutionary synthesis models to reclaim
the correct metallicity when fitted to the near-UV spectra of F stars of known
(sub-solar and super-solar) metallicity. F stars are of particular interest
because the rest-frame near-UV spectra of the oldest known elliptical galaxies
at z > 1 appear to be dominated by F stars near to the main-sequence turnoff.
  We find that, in the case of the F stars, where the HST ultraviolet spectra
have high signal:noise, model-fitting with metallicity allowed to vary as a
free parameter is rather successful at deriving the correct metallicity. As a
result, the estimated turnoff ages of these stars yielded by the model fitting
are well constrained. Encouraged by this we have fitted these same variable-
metallicity models to the deep, optical spectra of the z \simeq 1.5 mJy radio
galaxies 53W091 and 53W069 obtained with the Keck telescope. While the
age-metallicity degeneracy is not so easily lifted for these galaxies, we find
that even when metallicity is allowed as a free parameter, the best estimates
of their ages are still \geq 3 Gyr, with ages younger than 2 Gyr now strongly
excluded. Furthermore, we find that a search of the entire parameter space of
metallicity and star formation history using MOPED (Heavens et al., 2000) leads
to the same conclusion. Our results therefore continue to argue strongly
against an Einstein-de Sitter universe, and favour a lambda-dominated universe
in which star formation in at least these particular elliptical galaxies was
completed somewhere in the redshift range z = 3 - 5.

energy levels that dominate the tunneling shift abruptly with temperature. In
the presence of a transverse field and/or large longitudinal field these energy

heat pumps. In general, ratchets may be described as non-equilibrium systems in
which directed particle motion is generated using spatial or temporal
asymmetry. In a rocked ratchet, which may also be described as a non-linear
rectifier, an asymmetric potential is tilted symmetrically and periodically.
The potential deforms differently during each half-cycle, producing a net
current of particles when averaged over a full period of rocking. Recently it
was found that in the quantum regime, where tunnelling contributes to
transport, the net current may change sign with temperature. Here we show that
a Landauer model of an experimental tunnelling ratchet [Linke et. al., Science
286, 2314 (1999)] predicts the existence of a net heat current even when the
net particle current goes through zero. We quantify this heat current and
define a coefficient of performance for the ratchet as a heat pump, finding
that more heat is deposited in each of the two electron reservoirs due to the
process of rocking than is pumped from one reservoir to the other by the
ratchet.

Observations of the evolution of particle velocities over time reveal distinct
motion events, intervals where previously stationary particles move for a short
duration before jamming again. The cross-correlation between the velocities of
two particles at a given distance $r$ from the moving wall reveals a
characteristic lengthscale over which the particles are correlated. The
autocorrelation of a single particle's velocity reveals a characteristic
timescale $\tau$ which decreases with distance from the inner moving wall. This

the pion constituents. To the leading logarithmic accuracy (in energy), the
contribution coming from small transverse separations between the quark and the
antiquark in the pion acquires the expected factorized form, the longitudinal
momentum distribution of the jets being proportional to the pion distribution
amplitude. The hard gluon exchange can in this case be considered as a part of
the unintegrated gluon distribution. Beyond the leading logarithms (in energy)
this proportionality does not hold. Moreover, the collinear factorization
appears to be broken by the end-point singularities. Remarkably enough, the
longitudinal momentum distribution of the jets for the non-factorizable

formalism, and recent analytical lattice arguments, suggesting, after Abelian
gauge fixing, a description of pure gluodynamics by means of a Georgi-Glashow
like model, the corresponding vacuum fields are defined in a non-local way.
Using lattice information on the gauge invariant field strength correlator in
full QCD, the resolution scale $\La_b$, at which these fields become relevant
in the vacuum, is determined. For SU(3) gauge theory it is found that
$\La_b\sim$ 2.4 GeV, 3.1 GeV, and 4.2 GeV for ($N_F=4, m_q=18$ MeV), ($N_F=4,
m_q=36$ MeV), and pure gluodynamics, repectively. Implications for the operator
product expansion of physical correlators are discussed. It is argued that the
emergence of magnetic (anti)monopoles in the vacuum at resolution $\La_b$ is a
direct consequence of the randomness in the formation of a low entropy Higgs
condensate. This implies a breaking of chiral symmetry and a proliferation of
the axial U(1) anomaly at this scale already. Justifying Abelian projection, a
decoupling of non-Abelian gauge field fluctuations from the dynamics occurs.
The condensation of (anti)monopoles at $\La_c<\La_b$ follows from the demand
that vacuum fields ought to have vanishing action at any resolution. As
monopoles condense they are reduced to their cores, and hence they become
massless. Apparently broken gauge symmetries at resolutions $\La_c<\La\le\La_b$
are restored in this process.

description of fundamental physics in terms of continuous fields are a natural
outcome of discrete fields with discrete interactions. The discrete scalar
field is ultimately the gravitational field of general relativity, necessarily,
and there is no place for any other fundamental scalar field, in this context.
Part of the paper comprehends a more generic discussion about the nature, if
continuous or discrete, of fundamental interactions. There is a critical point
defined by the equivalence between the two descriptions. Discrepancies between
them can be observed far away from this point as a continuous-interaction is
always stronger below it and weaker above it than a discrete one. It is
possible that some discrete-field manifestations have already been observed in
the flat rotation curves of galaxies and in the apparent anomalous acceleration
of the Pioneer spacecrafts. The existence of a critical point is equivalent to
the introduction of an effective-acceleration scale which may put Milgrom's
MOND on a more solid physical basis. Contact is also made, on passing, with
inflation in cosmological theories and with Tsallis generalized one-parameter
statistics which is regarded as proper for discrete-interaction systems. The

do this by computing a destabilizing Coleman-Weinberg effective potential for

calculations of Tseytlin and Zarembo and interpreting them in terms of the
large-N behavior of twisted-sector modes. The dynamically generated potential
involves double-trace operators, which affect large-N correlators involving
twisted fields but not those involving only untwisted fields, in line with
large-N inheritance arguments. We point out a simple reason that no such small
radius instability exists in gauge theories arising from freely acting
orbifolds, which are tachyon-free at large radius. When an instability is
present, twisted gauge theory operators with the quantum numbers of the
large-radius tachyons aquire VEVs, leaving a gauge theory with fewer degrees of
freedom in the infrared, analogous to but less extreme than ``decays to
nothing'' studied in other systems with broken supersymmetry. In some cases one
is left with pure glue QCD plus decoupled matter and U(1) factors in the IR,

narrow annulus of the order of $N^{-1}$ around the unit circle on the complex
plane, and we find an explicit formula for the scaled density of the zeros
distribution along the radius in the limit $N\to\infty$.
  Our results are supported through various numerical simulations. We then
extend results of Hannay \cite{H} and Bleher, Shiffman, Zelditch \cite{BSZ2} to
derive different formulae for correlations between zeros of the SU(1,1) random
analytic functions, by applying the generalized Kac-Rice formula. We express
the correlation functions in terms of some Gaussian integrals, which can be
evaluated combinatorially as a finite sum over Feynman diagrams or as a
supersymmetric integral. Due to the SU(1,1) symmetry, the correlation functions
depend only on the hyperbolic distances between the points on the unit disk,
and we obtain an explicit formula for the two point correlation function. It
displays quadratic repulsion at small distances and fast decay of correlations
at infinity. In an appendix to the paper we evaluate correlations between the
outer zeros $|z_j|>1$ of the SU(1,1) random polynomial, and we prove that the
inner and outer zeros are independent in the limit when the degree of the

J., 114 (2002), 387--437",,,"math.AP",,"  On any compact Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ of dimension $n$, the
$L^2$-normalized eigenfunctions $\{\phi_{\lambda}\}$ satisfy
$||\phi_{\lambda}||_{\infty} \leq C \lambda^{\frac{n-1}{2}}$ where $-\Delta
\phi_{\lambda} = \lambda^2 \phi_{\lambda}.$ The bound is sharp in the class of
all $(M, g)$ since it is obtained by zonal spherical harmonics on the standard
$n$-sphere $S^n$. But of course, it is not sharp for many Riemannian manifolds,
e.g. flat tori $\R^n/\Gamma$. We say that $S^n$, but not $\R^n/\Gamma$, is a
Riemannian manifold with maximal eigenfunction growth. The problem which
motivates this paper is to determine the $(M, g)$ with maximal eigenfunction
growth. Our main result is that such an $(M, g)$ must have a point $x$ where
the set ${\mathcal L}_x$ of geodesic loops at $x$ has positive measure in
$S^*_x M$. We show that if $(M, g)$ is real analytic, this puts topological
restrictions on $M$, e.g. only $M = S^2$ (topologically) in dimension 2 can
possess a real analytic metric of maximal eigenfunction growth. We further show
that generic metrics on any $M$ fail to have maximal eigenfunction growth. In
addition, we construct an example of $(M, g)$ for which ${\mathcal L}_x$ has
positive measure for an open set of $x$ but which does not have maximal
eigenfunction growth, thus disproving a naive converse to the main result.

"math/0103173","Michael Roitman","Michael Roitman","Combinatorics of free vertex algebras",,,,,"math.QA",,"  This paper illustrates the combinatorial approach to vertex algebra - study
of vertex algebras presented by generators and relations. A necessary
ingredient of this method is the notion of free vertex algebra. Borcherds
\cite{bor} was the first to note that free vertex algebras do not exist in
general. The reason for this is that vertex algebras do not form a variety of
algebras, because the locality axiom (see sec 2 below) is not an identity.
However, a certain subcategory of vertex algebras, obtained by restricting the
order of locality of generators, has a universal object, which we call the free
vertex algebra corresponding to the given locality bound. In [J. of Algebra,
217(2):496-527] some free vertex algebras were constructed and in certain
special cases their linear bases were found. In this paper we generalize this
construction and find linear bases of an arbitrary free vertex algebra.
  It turns out that free vertex algebras are closely related to the vertex
algebras corresponding to integer lattices. The latter algebras play a very
important role in different areas of mathematics and physics. Here we explore
the relation between free vertex algebras and lattice vertex algebras in much
detail. These results comply with the use of the word ""free"" in physical
literature refering to some elements of lattice vertex algebras, like in ""free
field"", ""free bozon"" or ""free fermion"".
  Among other things, we find a nice presentation of lattice vertex algebras in
terms of generators and relations, thus giving an alternative construction of
these algebras without using vertex operators. We remark that our construction
works in a very general setting; we do not assume the lattice to be positive
definite, neither non-degenerate, nor of a finite rank.

  Sala Mayato, and I. L. Egusquiza. Springer-Verlag",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Under unitary evolution, systems move gradually from state to state. An
unstable atom has amplitude in its original state after many lifetimes
($\tau_L$). But in the laboratory, transitions seem to go instantaneously, as
suggested by the term ""quantum jump.""
  The problem studied here is whether the ""jump"" can be assigned a duration, in
theory and in experiment. Two characteristic times are defined, jump time
($\tau_J$) and passage time ($\tau_P$). Both use Zeno time, $\tau_Z$, defined
in terms of $H$ and its initial state as $\tau_Z \equiv \hbar/\sqrt{<\psi|
(H-E_\psi)^2 |\psi>}$, with $E_\psi \equiv <\psi|H|\psi>$.
  $\tau_J$ is defined in terms of the time needed to slow (\`a la the quantum
Zeno effect) the decay: $\tau_J \equiv \tau_Z^2/\tau_L$. It appears in several
contexts. It is related to tunneling time in barrier penetration. Its inverse
is the bandwidth of the Hamiltonian, in a time-energy uncertainty principle.
$\tau_J$ is also an indicator of the duration of the quadratic decay regime in
both experiment and in numerical calculations (cf. Fig.~2 of PRA 57,1509
(1998).)
  The passage time, $\tau_P$, arises from unitary evolution sans
interpretation. It is based on a bound of Fleming (Nuov. Cim. 16 A, 232
(1973)): for any $H$ and $\psi$ a system cannot evolve to a state orthogonal to
$\psi$ for $t< \tau_P \equiv \pi \tau_Z/2$. By including apparatus in $H$,
$\tau_P$ limits the observation of decay according to the quantum measurement
ideas proposed in ""Time's Arrows and Quantum Measurement,"" Cambridge U. Press,
1997, thereby allowing an experimental test of these ideas.
