Observations, in particular of Supernova~1987A, suggest that mixing processes
play an important role in the expanding star, and multi-dimensional simulations
show that these are linked to convective instabilities in the immediate
vicinity of the neutron star. Convectively enhanced energy transport inside the
neutron star can have important consequences for the neutrino emission and thus
the neutrino-heating mechanism. This also holds for a suppression of the
neutrino interactions at nuclear densities. Multi-dimensional hydrodynamics,
general relativity, and a better understanding of the neutrino interactions in

difference between the absolute magnitude from the uvby photometry and the
actual absolute magnitude of the star. We have found that the anomaly inversely
correlates with the binary components separation. There is evidence that the
correlation reflects actual population differences between close and wide
binary pairs, in which case it indicates that the anomaly is somehow associated
with the interaction of binary's components. The anomaly has also been found to
correlate with both kinematics and metallicity. The sense of the correlations
implies that the anomaly increases as the star evolves, suggesting a peculiar
evolution of a primary F star in a tight binary pair. This conclusion has
further been supported by the study of the age-velocity relation (AVR) of F
stars that are cataloged in the HIPPARCOS as single. Among these stars, those
with brightness anomaly were previously shown to be most likely unidentified
close binaries. We have found that the AVR of these binary candidates is
different from that of the ``truly single'' F stars. The discrepancy between
the two AVRs indicates that the putative binaries are, on average, older than
similar normal single F stars at the same effective temperature and luminosity,
which is consistent with the inferred peculiar evolution in close binaries. It
appears that this peculiarity is caused by the impact of the components
interaction in a tight pair on stellar evolution, which results in the
prolonged main sequence lifetime of the primary F star.

the foreseeable future, therefore, this field will be led by observational

through a simple linear biasing model with b = 1.5 and b = 3.6 for Abell/ACO
versus APM and Abell/ACO versus the PSCz respectively. Furthermore, the shape
of these power spectra are remarkably similar despite the fact that they are
comprised of significantly different objects (individual galaxies through to
rich clusters). Individually, each of these surveys show visible evidence for
``valleys'' in their power spectra. We use a newly developed statistical
technique called the False Discovery Rate, to show that these ``valleys'' are
statistically significant. One favored cosmological explanation for such
features in the power spectrum is the presence of a non-negligible baryon
fraction (Omega_b/Omega_m) in the Universe which causes acoustic oscillations
in the transfer function of adiabatic inflationary models. We have performed a
maximum-likelihood marginalization over four important cosmological parameters
of this model (Omega_m, Omega_b, n_s, H_o). We use a prior on H_0 = 69(+/-15),
and find Omega_mh^2 = 0.12(+0.03/-0.02), Omega_bh^2 =0.029(+0.011/-0.015), n_s

with the favored values of these cosmological parameters from the recent Cosmic

ejected from small newborn multiple systems which have decayed in dynamical
interactions. In this view, brown dwarfs are stellar embryos for which the star
formation process was aborted before the hydrostatic cores could build up
enough mass to eventually start hydrogen burning. The disintegration of a small
multiple system is a stochastic process, which can be described only in terms
of the half-life of the decay. A stellar embryo competes with its siblings in
order to accrete infalling matter, and the one that grows slowest is most
likely to be ejected. With better luck, a brown dwarf would therefore have
become a normal star. This interpretation of brown dwarfs readily explains the
rarity of brown dwarfs as companions to normal stars (aka the ``brown dwarf
desert''), the absence of wide brown dwarf binaries, and the flattening of the
low mass end of the initial mass function. Possible observational tests of this
scenario include statistics of brown dwarfs near Class 0 sources, and the
kinematics of brown dwarfs in star forming regions while they still retain a
kinematic signature of their expulsion. Because the ejection process limits the
amount of gas brought along in a disk, it is predicted that substellar
equivalents to the classical T Tauri stars should be very rare.

galaxies using archival WFPC2 images in the V and I-bands. The V-I color
distributions of at least 50% of the galaxies appear to be bimodal {\it at the
present level of photometric accuracy}. We argue that this is indicative of
multiple epochs of cluster formation early in the history of these galaxies,
possibly due to mergers. We also present the first evidence of bimodality in
low luminosity galaxies and discuss its implication on formation scenarios. The
mean color of the 28 cluster systems studied by us is V-I = 1.04$\pm$0.04
(0.01) mag corresponding to a mean metallicity of Fe/H = -1.0$\pm$0.19 (0.04).
We find that the turnover magnitudes of the globular cluster luminosity
functions (GCLF) of our sample are in excellent agreement with the distance
measurements using other methods and conclude that the accuracy of the GCLF is
at least as good as the surface brightness fluctuation method. The absolute
magnitude of the turnover luminosity of the GCLF is M$_V^0$ = -7.41 (0.03) in V
and M$_I^0$ = -8.46 (0.03) in I. The mean local specific frequency of our
sample of elliptical galaxies within the WFPC2 field-of-view is 2.4$\pm$1.8
(0.4), considerably higher than the 1.0$\pm$0.6 (0.1) derived for a comparable
sample of S0s in a similar analysis. It shows no obvious correlation with
metallicity, host galaxy mass or membership in a galaxy cluster. The median
size of clusters in all galaxies appears to be remarkably constant at $\sim$2.4
pc. We suggest that in the future it might be possible to use the sizes of

diverts the wind blown by the primary star, by accreting from the wind and
possibly by blowing its own collimated fast wind (CFW). The effect of these
processes depends on the orbital separation, hence on the orbital phase of the
eccentric orbit. The variation of the mass outflow from the binary system with
the orbital phase leads to a large-scale departure from axisymmetry along the
equatorial plane, as is observed in Eta Car. I further speculated that such a
companion may have accreted a large fraction of the mass that was expelled in
the Great Eruption of 1850 and the Lesser Eruption of 1890. The accretion
process was likely to form an accretion disk, with the formation of a CFW, or
jets, on the two sides of the accretion disk. The CFW may have played a crucial
role in the formation of the two lobes.

the ISO/SWS spectrograph on-board ISO. These spectra reveal a plethora of
emission features with bands at 11.0, 11.2, 12.0, 12.7, 13.5 and 14.2 micron.
These features are observed to vary considerably in relative strength to
each-other from source to source. In particular, the 10-15 micron spectra of
the evolved stars are dominated by the 11.2 micron band while for H II regions
the 12.7 is typically as strong as the 11.2 micron band. Analysing the ISO data
we find a good correlation between the 11.2 micron band and the 3.3 micron
band, and between the 12.7 micron and the 6.2 micron band. There is also a
correlation between the ratio of the UIR bands to the total dust emission and
the 12.7 over 11.2 micron ratio. Bands in the 10-15 micron spectral region are
due to CH out-of-plane (OOP) bending modes of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs). We summarise existing laboratory data and theoretical quantum chemical
calculations of these modes for neutral and cationic PAHs. Due to mode
coupling, the exact peak position of these bands depends on the number of
adjacent CH groups and hence the observed interstellar 10-15 micron spectra can
be used to determine the molecular structure of the interstellar PAHs emitting
in the different regions. We conclude that evolved stars predominantly inject
compact ~100-200 C-atom PAHs into the ISM where they are subsequently
processed, resulting in more open and uneven PAH structures.

in the submillimeter lines are stronger by a factor of 3-4 than that of the CO

this outflow consists of moderately dense gas of n(H_2) = (1-3)x10^4 cm^-3

us with direct evidence that the molecular gas at the head of the jet-driven

around known cluster members and a pattern of blind fields along the major and
minor axes of the cluster were studied with mosaic CCD cameras on the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. The dynamical crossing time for the Ursa Major
Cluster is only slightly less than a Hubble time. Most galaxies in the local
Universe exist in similar moderate density environments. The Ursa Major Cluster
is therefore a good place to study the statistical properties of dwarf galaxies
since this structure is at an evolutionary stage representative of typical
environments yet has enough galaxies that reasonable counting statistics can be
accumulated. The main observational results of our survey are: (i) The galaxy
luminosity function is flat, with a logarithmic slope alpha = -1.1 for -17 <
M_R < -11, from a power-law fit. The error in alpha is likely to be less than
0.2 and is dominated by systematic errors, primarily associatedd with
uncertainties in assigning membership to specific galaxies. This faint end
slope is quite different to what was seen in the Virgo Cluster where
alpha=-2.26. (ii) Dwarf galaxies are as frequently found to be blue dwarf
irregulars as red dwarf spheroidals in the blind cluster fields. The density of
red dwarfs is significantly higher in the fields around luminous members than
in the blind fields. The most important result is the failure to detect many
dwarfs. If the steep luminosity function claimed for the Virgo Cluster were
valid for Ursa Major then in our blind fields we should have found about 1000
galaxies with -17 < M_R <-11 where we have found two dozen.

problem is such that our results are not generically exact, but must only be
considered as excellent approximations which nonetheless are valid all the way
through crossover regimes.
  The key to our approach is to identify the excitations that correspond to
scattering states and then to compute their associated scattering amplitudes.
We are able to do so both in and out of equilibrium. In equilibrium and at zero
temperature, we reproduce the Friedel sum rule for an arbitrary magnetic field.
At finite temperature, we study the linear response conductance at the
symmetric point of the Anderson model, and reproduce Costi et al.'s numerical
renormalization group computation of this quantity. We then explore the
out-of-equilibrium conductance for a near-symmetric Anderson model, and arrive
at quantitative expressions for the differential conductance, both in and out
of a magnetic field. We find the expected splitting of the differential
conductance peak into two in a finite magnetic field, $H$. We determine the
width, height, and position of these peaks. In particular we find for H >> T_k,
the Kondo temperature, the differential conductance has maxima of e^2/h
occuring for a bias V close to but smaller than H. The nature of our

Deviations from parabolicity (simple bowing) are of order 10 % in the most
extreme case of AlInN alloy, much less at all other compositions. Piezoelectric
polarization is also strongly non-linear. At variance with the spontaneous

almost quenched by the Kondo effect in the strong coupling region ($T_{\rm

all the $T_{\rm K}/\Delta$ region. Here $T_{\rm K}$ and $\Delta$ are the Kondo

dynamics of the paired electrons, generating the spin of the ground state. This

competing effects determine the common collective soundwave-like mode with

sufficiently large O-O hoppings, two bands can come together at one point on
the diagonal of the square Brillouin zone, but they cannot cross. The range of
the parameters for which the band touching occurs is determined. The model
relates the band touching at the bottom of the two bands to the appearance of
the extended, one-dimensional-like van Hove singularity at the lower edge of
the density of states. With 1+\delta holes (\delta small) the extended van Hove
singularity can thus occur close to the Fermi level only if the latter cuts two
bands.The topology of the Fermi surfaces observed by ARPES in the high-Tc

one-dimensional, driven, two-species lattice model [Lahiri and Ramaswamy, PRL
79 (1997) 1150] in which the mobility of each species depends on the density of
the other. The model shows three phases. The first is characterised by phase
separation of an exceptionally robust sort, termed Strong Phase Separation,
which survives at all temperature. The second phase has trivial static
correlations, but density fluctuations are transported by a pair of kinematic
waves involving both species. In the most interesting case, the two linearised
eigenmodes, although nonlinearly coupled, have different dynamic exponents. The
third ``phase'' arises at the phase boundary between the first two. Here, the
first species evolves autonomously, but its fluctuations influence the
evolution of the second, as in the passive scalar problem. The second species
then shows phase separation of a delicate sort, with density fluctuations
persisting even in the large-size limit. This fluctuation-dominated phase
ordering is associated with power law decays in cluster size distributions and
a breakdown of the Porod law.

three possible wave patterns corresponding to the propagation of the different

general, when solving the Riemann problem numerically, the determination of the
specific wave pattern produced is obtained through some initial guess which can
be successively discarded or improved. We here discuss a new procedure,
suitable for implementation in an exact Riemann solver in one dimension, which
removes the initial ambiguity in the wave pattern. In particular we focus our
attention on the relativistic velocity jump between the two initial states and
use this to determine, through some analytic conditions, the wave pattern
produced by the decay of the initial discontinuity. The exact Riemann problem
is then solved by means of calculating the root of a nonlinear equation.
Interestingly, in the case of two rarefaction waves, this root can even be
found analytically. Our procedure is straightforward to implement numerically
and improves the efficiency of numerical codes based on exact Riemann solvers.

Reece, Reiner and Melissinos, who, {in 1984}, built a detector of this kind.
They showed that an harmonic modulation of the cavity length l produced an
energy transfer between two modes of the cavity, provided that the frequency of
the modulation was equal to the frequency difference of the two modes. They
achieved a sensitivity to fractional deformations of dl/l~10^{-17} Hz^{-1/2}.

to the central feature of out of equilibrium TFT. We analyze the pinching
phenomenon. In the case of naive pinching we reproduce known results. In
Schwinger-Dyson equations the Keldysh component of self-energy is well defined
even for multiple self-energy insertion contributions. We calaculate explicitly
single self-energy contribution to Keldysh component of propagator which

  Physics","10 pages, 1 figure",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Beside the rise of total cross sections or interaction radii of colliding
high energetic particles and the shrinkage of mean-free-paths of ultra
relativistic particles (nucleii) in material media (anomalons), which have been
shown to be of special relativistic origin [1], still other phenomena in high
energy physics may arise from relativistic kinematics. In particular this seems
to be the case with the EMC-effect and the so called atmosperic neutrino
anomaly.

  system",,,,,"quant-ph",,"  In a recent paper (quant-ph/0102133) Chen, Liang, Li and Huang suggest a
necessary and sufficient separability criterion, which is supposedly practical
in judging the separability of any mixed state. In this note we briefly
recapitulate their main result and show that it is a reformulation of the
problem rather than a practical criterion.

  Han","Remark On Quantum Battle of The Sexes Game",,,,,"quant-ph",,"  Recently Quantum Battle of The Sexes Game has been studied by Luca Marinatto
and Tullio Weber. Yet some important problems exist in their scheme. Here we
propose a new scheme to quantize Battle of The Sexes Game, and this scheme will
truly remove the dilemma that exists in the classical form of the game.

transformations in terms of local filtering operations and whether the optimal
entanglement for an arbitrary two-qubit state could be realised. We introduce
an experimentally realisable scheme for manipulating the entanglement of an
arbitrary state of two polarisation entangled qubits. This scheme is then used
to provide some perspective to the mathematical concepts inherent in this field
with respect to a laboratory environment. Specifically, we look at how to
extract enhanced entanglement from systems with a fixed rank and in the case
where the rank of the density operator for the state can be reduced, show how
the state can be made arbitrarily close to a maximally entangled pure state. In
this context we also discuss bounds on entanglement in mixed states.
