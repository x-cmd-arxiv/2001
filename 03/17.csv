as the feedback by stellar winds and SN explosions follows the star formation.
Their impact is amplified by the same large scale accretion shocks that
thermalize the gravitational energy of gas falling into the growing potential

the ICM temperature, the $y-T$ relation, which departs from the self-similar

model-independently relate this with the analogous behaviour of the L_x - T

  From the relative number of Seyfert 1's and Seyfert 2's we calculate that the
torus half opening angle is 48deg. We show that, as seen in previous papers,
there is a lack of edge-on Seyfert 1 galaxies, suggesting dust and gas along
the host galaxy disk probably play an important role in hiding some nuclei from
direct view. We find that there is no statistically significant difference in
the distribution of host galaxy morphological types and radio luminosities of
Seyfert 1's and Seyfert 2's, suggesting that previous results showing the
opposite may have been due to selection effects. The average extension of the
radio emission of Seyfert 1's is smaller than that of Seyfert 2's by a factor
of ~2-3, as predicted by the Unified Model. A search for galaxies around our
Seyferts allows us to put a lower and an upper limit on the possible number of
companions around these galaxies of 19% and 28%, respectively, with no
significant difference in the number of companion galaxies between Seyfert 1's

be aligned closer to the host galaxy disk axis in late type Seyferts, unlike

results can be summarised as follows. Type 1 and type 2 Seyferts produce
compact radio components which are indistinguishable in strength and aspect,
indicating that their central engines are alike as proposed by the unification
model. Infrared IRAS fluxes are more closely correlated with low-resolution
radio fluxes than high-resolution radio fluxes, suggesting that they are
dominated by kiloparsec-scale, extra-nuclear emission regions; extra-nuclear
emission may be stronger in type 2 Seyferts. Early-type Seyfert galaxies tend
to have stronger nuclear radio emission than late-type Seyfert galaxies.
V-shaped extended emission-line regions, indicative of `ionisation cones', are
usually found in sources with large, collimated radio outflows. Hidden broad
lines are most likely to be found in sources with powerful nuclear radio
sources. Type 1 and type 2 Seyferts selected by their IRAS 12-micron flux
densities have well matched properties.

have analyzed archival ASCA data for several known AXPs and SGRs, and fitted
them with a model in which all or part of the X-ray flux originates as thermal
emission from a magnetar. Our magnetar spectral model includes the effects of
the anisotropy of the heat flow through an ultramagnetized neutron star
envelope, reprocessing by a light element atmosphere, and general relativistic
corrections to the observed spectrum. We obtain good fits to the data with
radii for the emitting areas which are generally consistent with those expected
for neutron stars, in contrast to blackbody (BB) fits, which imply much smaller
radii. Furthermore, the inclusion of atmospheric effects results in inferred
temperatures which are lower than those implied by BB fits, but however still
too high to be accounted by thermal cooling alone. An extra source of heating
(possibly due to magnetic field decay) is needed. Despite the harder tail in
the spectrum produced by reprocessing of the outgoing flux through the
atmosphere, spectral fits still require a considerable fraction of the flux to
be in a power-law component.

emission should demonstrate signatures of curvature from the emitting shell.
Specifically, the shape of the pulse decay must bear a strict dependence on the
degree of curvature of the gamma-ray emitting surface. We compare the spectral
evolution of the decay of individual GRB pulses to the evolution as expected
from curvature. In particular, we examine the relationship between photon flux
intensity (I) and the peak of the \nu F\nu distribution (E_{peak}) as predicted
by colliding shells. Kinematics necessitate that E_{peak} demonstrate a
power-law relationship with I described roughly as: I=E_{peak}^{(1-\zeta)}
where \zeta represents a weighted average of the low and high energy spectral
indices. Data analyses of 24 BATSE gamma-ray burst pulses provide evidence that
there exists a robust relationship between E_{peak} and I in the decay phase.
Simulation results, however, show that a sizable fraction of observed pulses
evolve faster than kinematics allow. Regardless of kinematic parameters, we
found that the existence of curvature demands that the I - E_{peak} function
decay be defined by \sim (1-\zeta). Efforts were employed to break this
curvature dependency within simulations through a number of scenarios such as
anisotropic emission (jets) with angular dependencies, thickness values for the
colliding shells, and various cooling mechanisms. Of these, the only method
successful in dominating curvature effects was a slow cooling model. As a
result, GRB models must confront the fact that observed pulses do not evolve in
the manner which curvature demands.

well as from the occupation states for site-percolation on the square lattice.
The first and second order static phase transitions of the Potts model are
located by a sharp change in the value of the roughness exponent $\alpha$
characterizing those profiles. The low temperature phase of the Potts model
corresponds to flat ($\alpha\simeq 1$) profiles, whereas its high temperature
phase is associated to rough ($\alpha\simeq 0.5$) ones. For the p=10 clock
model, in addition to the flat (ferromagnetic) and rough (paramagnetic)
profiles, an intermediate rough ($0.5< \alpha <1$) phase - associated to a soft
spin-wave one - is observed. Our results for the transition temperatures in the
Potts and clock models are in agreement with the static values, showing that
this approach is able to detect the phase transitions in these models directly
from the spin configurations, without any reference to thermodynamical
potentials, order parameters or response functions. Finally, we show that the
roughness exponent $\alpha$ is insensitive to geometric critical phenomena.

collapse of a very massive body. Without needing to change the concept of the
collapsing process itself, that is, without invoking thin layers nor resorting
to asymptoticity (as has been usually done in the literature), it is proven
that a model can be built in which the quantum vacuum is able to produce a
negative stress that may stop the collapse of the black hole, reaching a final
state of the spacetime structure that is a static de Sitter model. The solution
is found by looking into a generic family of spacetimes: that of maximal
spherically symmetric ones expanded by a geodesic radial null one-form from
flat spacetime. They are called here GRNSS spaces, and are proven to constitute
a distinguished family of Kerr-Schild metrics. The models considered previously
in the literature are easily recovered in this approach, which yields,
moreover, an infinite set of possible candidates for the interior of the black
hole. First steps towards their semiclassical quantization are undertaken. It
is shown that the quantization protocol may be here more easily carried out

method'', we study the diagrams that contribute to Compton scattering off a

$N$--particle bound states described by the covariant Bethe--Salpeter equation
with a method equivalent to minimal substitution in the one--particle case and
yield the correct contributions (including subtraction terms) in the order
${\cal O}(e^2)$. We give the Ward--Takahashi identities for the general
two--photon vertex as well as the corresponding constraints for the two--photon
irreducible interaction kernel and the Bethe--Salpeter amplitude describing the
bound state. From this we can show that gauge invariance holds for the full
two--photon vertex. We furthermore study in detail the low--energy limit of the
Compton scattering tensor in this approach (including a discussion of the pole
terms) and can prove that the full amplitude yields the correct Born--Thomson
limit as we shall explicitly show for the spin--0 case.
  The calculations are completed by the investigation of certain approximations
that can be formulated for arbitrary $N$--particle bound states. We neglect for
instance contributions from $n$--photon irreducible interaction kernels and
show that in this case gauge invariance is only realized if either the
interaction kernel in the Bethe--Salpeter equation is independent of the total
momentum and additionally is of local type, or if the photon energies vanish;
furthermore, we find the correct low--energy limit in this approximation. To
clarify our approach, we also give the results in the order ${\cal O} (e)$; as
examples, we will quote some resulting lowest order expressions for a $q\bar q$
