Employing more general repulsive fluids (""dark energy"") encompassing the Lambda
component we quantitatively compare both approaches with each other.
  Fitting the SN-data by a minimum-component model consisting of dark energy +
dust yields a closed universe with a large amount of dust exceeding the
baryonic content constrained by big-bang nucleosynthesis. The nature of the
dark energy is hardly constrained. Only when enforcing a flat universe there is
a clear tendency to a dark-energy Lambda fluid and the `canonical' value
Omega_M = 0.3 for dust.
  Conversely, fitting the quasar-data by a minimum-component model yields a
sharply defined, slightly closed model with a low dust density ruling out
significant pressureless dark matter. The dark-energy component obtains an
equation-of-state P = -0.96 epsilon close to that of a Lambda-fluid. Omega_M =
0.3 or a precisely flat spatial geometry are inconsistent with
minimum-component models.
  It is found that quasar and supernova data sets cannot be reconciled with
each other via (repulsive ideal fluid+dust+radiation)-world models.
Compatibility could be reached by drastic expansion of the parameter space with
at least two exotic fluids added to dust and radiation as world constituents.
If considering such solutions as far-fetched one has to conclude that the
quasar absorption line and the SN-Ia constraints are incompatible.

Measurements of polarized far-infrared radiation from thermally aligned dust
grains are used to map the orientation of the field and estimate its strength,

reliability of this method, we apply it to simulated far-infrared polarization
maps derived from three-dimensional simulations of supersonic
magnetohydrodynamical turbulence, and compare the estimated values to the known
magnetic field strengths in the simulations. We investigate the effects of
limited telescope resolution and self-gravity on the structure of the maps.
Limited observational resolution affects the field structure such that small
scale variations can be completely suppressed, thus giving the impression of a
very homogeneous field. The Chandrasekhar-Fermi method of estimating the mean
magnetic field in a turbulent medium is tested, and we suggest an extension to
measure the rms field. Both methods yield results within a factor of 2 for
field strengths typical of molecular clouds, with the modified version
returning more reliable estimates for slightly weaker fields. However, neither
method alone works well for very weak fields, missing them by a factor of up to
150. Taking the geometric mean of both methods estimates even the weakest
fields accurately within a factor of 2.5. Limited telescope resolution leads to
a systematic overestimation of the field strengths for all methods. We discuss
the effects responsible for this overestimation and show how to extract
information on the underlying (turbulent) power spectrum.

systematically in the axial gauge. We show that there is no IR/UV mixing in
this theory in this gauge. In fact, we show, using the usual BRST identities as
well as the identities following from vector supersymmetry, that this is a free
theory. As a result, the tree level Chern-Simons coefficient is not
renormalized. It also holds that the Chern-Simons coefficient is not modified
at finite temperature. As a byproduct of our analysis, we prove that the ghosts
completely decouple in the axial gauge in a noncommutative gauge theory.

four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory can be spontaneously broken in a nonlinear
partial gauge due to ghost-anti-ghost condensation. However, we show that the
spontaneous BRST symmetry breaking can be avoided if we adopt the modified
Maximal Abelian gauge which is an orthosymplectic $OSp(4|2)$ invariant
renormalizable gauge proposed by the author to derive quark confinement. We
compare the Maximal Abelian gauge with the conventional $OSp(4|2)$ invariant
gauge proposed by Delbourgo-Jarvis and Baulieu-Thierry-Mieg. Finally, an
implication to the Gribov problem is briefly mentioned.

C64 (2001) 014301","10.1103/PhysRevC.64.014301",,"nucl-th",,"  The molecule-like structure of the C isotopes (A=12, 14, 16) is investigated
using a microscopic $\alpha+\alpha+\alpha+n+n+\cdot \cdot \cdot$ model. The
valence neutrons are classified based on the molecular-orbit (MO) model, and
both $\pi$-orbit and $\sigma$-orbit are introduced around three
$\alpha$-clusters. The valence neutrons which occupy the $\pi$-orbit increase
the binding energy and stabilize the linear-chain of 3$\alpha$ against the
breathing-like break-up. However, $^{14}$C with the $\pi$-orbit does not show
clear energy minimum against the bending-like path. The combination of the
valence neutrons in the $\pi$- and the $\sigma$-orbit is promising to stabilize
the linear-chain state against the breathing- and bending- modes, and it is
found that the excited states of $^{16}$C with the
$(3/2^-_\pi)^2(1/2^-_\sigma)^2$ configuration for the four valence neutrons is
one of the most promising candidates for such structure.

  respect to v/c","4 pages, 3 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the first version of this paper (arXiv: 1003.2899v1, 15.03.2010) there is
described first, traditional method of measuring the non-zero shift of
interference fringe in the Michelson interferometer, operating on the effects
of second order with respect to v/c, and are revealed hidden causes of the
failure to measure the shift of interference fringe in the period from 1881
till 1960. It is shown that at the latitude of Obninsk within a 24-hour
observation period the horizontal projection of aether wind velocity varies
from 140 km/s to 480 km/s. The second version of this paper (arXiv:
1003.2899v2, 15.04.2010) is supplemented with a second method of finding the
velocity of the aether wind -- through measuring the largest seasonal decrease
in the ratio of the summer shift of the interference fringe to the winter one
(equaled ~12%). It gave the same interval of values of the projections of the
aether wind velocity as the first method. More than hundred years there
persists a belief that Michelson-type interferometer can not be adjusted such
as to detect effects of the first order with respect to v/c. Below I show that
it is possible, and more successfully than on the interferometer of the second
order. In contrast to the traditional approach, in the interferometer of the
first order the light after splitting on a semi-transparent plate propagates in
both arms to the reflecting mirrors in one optical medium, and returns after
reflection from the mirrors through another optical medium. The shift of the
interference fringe was found to be proportional to the difference of
dielectric permittivities of these media. The horizontal projection of the
Earth's velocity relative to luminiferous aether measured by the first order
interferometer agrees with that found by the first two methods.
