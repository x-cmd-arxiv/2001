canonical ensemble by using a thermodynamical approach. Our study extends the
earlier work of Padmanabhan [Astrophys. J. Supp. 71, 651 (1989)] in the
microcanonical ensemble. By studying the second variations of the free energy,
we find that instability sets in precisely at the point of minimum temperature
in agreement with the theorem of Katz [ Mon. Not. R. astr. Soc. 183, 765
(1978)]. The perturbation that induces instability at this point is calculated
explicitly; it has not a ``core-halo'' structure contrary to what happens in
the microcanonical ensemble. We also study Jeans type gravitational instability
of isothermal gaseous spheres described by Navier-Stokes equations. We show
analytically the equivalence between dynamical stability and thermodynamical
stability and the fact that the stability of isothermal gas spheres does not
depend on the viscosity. This confirms the findings of Semelin et al.
[astro-ph/9908073] who used numerical methods. We also give a simpler
derivation of the geometric hierarchy of scales inducing instability discovered
by these authors. The density profiles that trigger these instabilities are
calculated analytically; they present more and more oscillations that also
follow a geometric progression. This suggests that the system will fragmentate
in a series of `clumps' and that these `clumps' will themselves fragmentate in
substructures. The fact that both the domain sizes leading to instability and
the `clumps' sizes within a box follow a geometric progression with the same
ratio suggests a fractal-like behaviour. This gives further support to the
interpretation of de Vega et al. [Nature, 383, 56 (1996)].

of cosmic rays at and just above the ``knee'' in the observed cosmic ray
spectrum at $10^{15}$--$10^{16}$ eV. We suggest that iron nuclei may be
accelerated in the outer gaps of pulsars, and then suffer partial
photo-disintegration in the non-thermal radiation fields of the outer gaps. As
a result, protons, neutrons, and surviving heavier nuclei are injected into the
expanding supernova remnant. We compute the spectra of nuclei escaping from
supernova remnants into the interstellar medium, taking into account the
observed population of radio pulsars.
  Our calculations, which include a realistic model for acceleration and
propagation of nuclei in pulsar magnetospheres and supernova remnants, predict
that heavy nuclei accelerated directly by gamma-ray pulsars could contribute
about 20% of the observed cosmic rays in the knee region. Such a contribution
of heavy nuclei to the cosmic ray spectrum at the knee can significantly
increase the average value of $<\ln A>$ with increasing energy as is suggested
by recent observations.

understood as caused by a thermal instability in the accretion disk, the same
mechanism as in dwarf novae outbursts. During quiescence the accretion occurs
via a cool disk in the outer region but changes to a coronal flow/ADAF in the
inner region. The transition to the coronal flow is caused by evaporation of
matter from the cool disk. This process is an important feature for the disk
evolution. We point out that if the disk is depleted during the outburst, e.g.
by irradiation, its evolution during quiescence is independent of the detailed
outburst luminosity decline. The mass accumulation during quiescence has to
meet several constraints as the accretion rate, the recurrence time and the
total outburst energy. We present a critical discussion of different ways to
model X-ray transient outburst cycles and compare with the requirements from
observations. For the case of only little mass left over after the outburst the
observations indicate a frictional parameter in the cool disk of order
alpha(cold) =0.05, similar to that in dwarf nova disks during quiescence, with
no need to resort to much lower alpha values of order 0.005.

memory, plus or minus two. We counted the number of bunsetsus (phrases) whose
modifiees are undetermined in each step of an analysis of the dependency
structure of Japanese sentences, and which therefore must be stored in
short-term memory. The number was roughly less than nine, the upper bound of
seven plus or minus two. We also obtained similar results with English
sentences under the assumption that human beings recognize a series of words,
such as a noun phrase (NP), as a unit. This indicates that if we assume that
the human cognitive units in Japanese and English are bunsetsu and NP
respectively, analysis will support Miller's $7 \pm 2$ theory.

gauged supergravity theories and then up-lift them to ten dimensions. In
particular, we find solutions for field configurations with either non-Abelian

is up-lifted to the massless type IIA string theory. This is the first example
of such a kind. The cases studied provide new examples of the AdS/CFT duality

from q and a normalisation factor our $\hat{R}$ contains two free parameters,
instead of only one such parameter for deformed unitary algebras studied in a
previous paper [1] where the nonzero right hand side of the $MBE$ had a linear
term proprotional to $(\hat{R}_{(12)} - \hat{R}_{(23)})$. In the present case
the r.h.s. is, in general, nonliear. Several particular solutions are given
(Sec.2) and the general structure is analysed (App.A). Our formulation of the

general change their shape after interaction due to a change in the intensity
distribution among the modes even though the total energy is conserved.
However, the standard shape-preserving collision (elastic collision) property
of the (1+1)-dimensional solitons is recovered when restrictions are imposed on
some of the soliton parameters. As a consequence the following further
properties can be deduced using this shape-changing collision. (i) The exciting
possibility of switching of solitons between orthogonally polarized modes of
the birefringent fiber exists. (ii) When additional effects due to periodic
rotation of birefringence axes are considered, the shape changing collision can
be used as a switch to suppress or to enhance the periodic intensity exchange
between the orthogonally polarized modes. (iii) For ultra short optical soliton
pulse propagation in non-Kerr media, from the governing equation an integrable
system of coupled nonlinear Schroedinger equation with cubic-quintic terms is
identified. It admits a nonlocal Poisson bracket structure. (iv) If we take the
higher-order terms in the coupled nonlinear Schroedinger equation into account
then their effect on the shape-changing collision of solitons, during optical
pulse propagation, can be studied by using a direct perturbational approach.

parametric down-conversion are analyzed in detail.
  The second part shows that the dynamical rules of quantum physics can be
derived from its static properties and the condition that superluminal
communication is forbidden.
  In the third part a very simple form of the Kochen-Specker theorem is
presented, which leads to a proposal for a simple experimental test of
non-contextual hidden variables.
  The fourth part shows how hidden-variable theorems can be derived in a
completely operational way. In particular a Kochen-Specker theorem is derived
that applies to experiments with finite precision.

emission of Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation in a coherently driven medium. We show
that in this case the aperture of the group cone on which the intensity of the
radiation peaks is much smaller than that of the usual wave cone associated
with the Cherenkov coherence condition. We show that such a singular behaviour
may be observed in a coherently driven ultracold atomic gas.

formalism and propose a type of nonlinear spin coherent state by the nonlinear
time evolution of spin coherent states. By a new version of spectroscopic
squeezing criteria we study the spin squeezing in both the spin coherent state
and nonlinear spin coherent state. The results show that the spin coherent
state is not squeezed in the x, y, and z directions, and the nonlinear spin
coherent state may be squeezed in the x and y directions.
