structures that might be indicative of the presence of a supernova remnant

We also carried out HI-line observations of the region looking for a local
minimum created by an explosive event. Our results indicate that there is, in
fact, a bubble in the large-scale HI distribution around GRO J1655-40. We
suggest that this structure might be created by the original supernova
explosion occurred a few hundred thousand years ago and whose signatures can be
traced by the overabundance of alpha-elements recently found by Israelian et
al. (1999) in the companion star.

circumstellar disks, such as occur around Be stars. For radially streaming
radiation, line forces are only effective if there is a strong radial velocity
gradient, as occurs, for example, in a line-driven stellar wind. However,
within an orbiting disk, the radial shear of the azimuthal velocity leads to
strong line-of-sight velocity velocity gradients along nonradial directions. As
such, in the proximity of a stellar surface extending over a substantial cone
angle, the nonradial stellar radiation can impart a significant line force,
even in the case of purely circular orbits. Given the highly supersonic nature
of orbital velocity variations, we use the Sobolev approximation, thereby
extending to the disk case the standard CAK formalism developed for line-driven
winds. We delineate the parameter regimes for which radiative forces might
alter disk properties; but even when radiative forces are small, we
analytically quantify higher-order effects in the linear limit, including the
precession of weakly elliptical orbits. We find that optically thick line
forces can have observable implications for the dynamics of disks around Be
stars, including the generation of either prograde or retrograde precession in
slightly eccentric orbits. However, our analysis suggests a net retrograde
effect, in apparent contradiction with observed long-term variations of
violet/red line profile asymmetries from Be stars, which are generally thought
to result from prograde propagation of a so-called ``one arm mode''. We also
conclude that radiative forces may alter the dynamical properties at the
surface of the disk where disk winds originate, and may even make low-density
disks vulnerable to being blown away.

solutions to a relativistic Schr\""odinger equation with invariant evolution
parameter, and represent mass eigenstates whose eigenvalues correspond to the

nonrelativistic case, the off-diagonal perturbation leads to a lifting of the
degeneracy in the mass spectrum. In the covariant case, not only do the
spectral lines split, but they acquire an imaginary part which is lnear in the
applied electric field, thus revealing induced bound state decay in first order
perturbation theory. This imaginary part results from the coupling of the
external field to the non-compact boost generator. In order to recover the
conventional first order Stark splitting, we must include a scalar potential
term. This term may be understood as a fifth gauge potential, which compensates
for dependence of gauge transformations on the invariant evolution parameter.
