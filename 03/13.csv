both features: (1) In this theory the vierbein is interpreted as the

Analogous to the
Circumstellar Habitable Zone (CHZ), the GHZ is that region in the Milky Way
where an Earth-like planet can retain liquid water on its surface and provide a
long-term habitat for animal-like aerobic life. In this paper we examine the
dependence of the GHZ on Galactic chemical evolution. The single most important
factor is likely the dependence of terrestrial planet mass on the metallicity
of its birth cloud. We estimate, very approximately, that a metallicity at
least half that of the Sun is required to build a habitable terrestrial planet.
The mass of a terrestrial planet has important consequences for interior heat
loss, volatile inventory, and loss of atmosphere. A key issue is the production
of planets that sustain plate tectonics, a critical recycling process that
provides feedback to stabilize atmospheric temperatures on planets with oceans
and atmospheres. Due to the more recent decline from the early intense star
formation activity in the Milky Way, the concentration in the interstellar
medium of the geophysically important radioisotopes, $^{40}$K, $^{235, 238}$U,
$^{232}$Th, has been declining relative to Fe, an abundant element in the
Earth. Also likely important are the relative abundances of Si and Mg to Fe,
which affects the mass of the core relative to the mantle in a terrestrial
planet. All these elements and isotopes vary with time and location in the
Milky Way; thus, planetary systems forming in other locations and times in the
Milky Way with the same metallicity as the Sun will not necessarily form
habitable Earth-like planets.

revised downward by a factor of 10, due to previous omission of thermal speeds
in ion-neutral momentum-exchange rates. The physical origin of the temperature
plateau is outlined. Predictions are then compared with T~Tauri star
observations, with emphasis on the necessity of suitable beam convolution. Jet
widths and variations in line profiles with distance and line tracer are well
reproduced. However, predicted maximum velocities are too high, total densities
too low, and the low-velocity [OI] component is too weak. Denser, slower MHD

of the critical density, is very smoothly distributed, and has large negative
pressure. Its nature is very much unknown. Most of its discernible consequences
follow from its effect on evolution of the expansion rate of the Universe,
which in turn affects the growth of density perturbations and the age of the
Universe, and can be probed by the classical kinematic cosmological tests.
Absent a compelling theoretical model (or even a class of models), we describe
dark energy by an effective equation of state w=p_X/rho_X which is allowed to
vary with time. We describe and compare different approaches for determining
w(t), including magnitude-redshift (Hubble) diagram, number counts of galaxies

sample of several thousand type Ia supernova with redshifts z < 1.7, as might
be gathered by the proposed SNAP satellite. Among other things, we derive
optimal strategies for constraining cosmological parameters using type Ia
supernovae. While in the near term CMB anisotropy will provide the first

spectral and timing properties of GRS 1915+105 during the hard steady states.
According to the results of our simultaneous X-ray spectral and timing analysis
the behavior the source during the hard steady states can be reduced to a
couple of major distinct types. i) Type I states: The dominant hard component
of the energy spectrum has characteristic quasi- exponential cut-off at 50-120
keV. The broad-band power density spectrum of the source shows significant high
frequency noise component with a cut-off at 60-80 Hz. ii) Type II states: The
hard spectral component has a break in its slope at ~12-20 keV. The high
frequency part of the power density spectrum fades quickly lacking significant
variability at frequencies higher than ~30 Hz. These two types of the X-ray
hard states are also clearly distinguished by their properties in the radio
band: while during the type I observations the source tends to be
'radio-quiet', the type II observations are characterized by high level of
radio flux ('plateau' radio states). In this work we demonstrate aforementioned
differences using the data of 12 representative hard steady state observations.
We conclude that the difference between these two types can be probably
explained in terms of different structure of the accretion flow in the
immediate vicinity of the compact object due to presence of relativistic
outflow of matter.

wavebands. We find that the ratio of the soft X-ray to the far-infrared flux
spans about 5 orders of magnitude and reaches values of about unity. This ratio
is a good indicator of the main energy source of ULIRGs. Those with soft X-ray
to far-infrared flux exceeding 0.01 are probably powered by accretion onto
central supermassive black holes while those with ratios smaller than 0.001 are
probably caused by starbursts or other heating processes, or are Compton thick
sources. Some ULIRGs have energy contributions from both. This ratio is low for
most ULIRGs and hyperluminous infrared galaxies, which explains their low
detection rate by ROSAT and ASCA. We also find that some ULIRGs have a similar
soft X-ray luminosity vs. temperature relation to that for groups of galaxies

the light curves of the fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars and their basic stellar
parameters has been extended to considerably larger data sets. The most
significant contribution to the absolute magnitude M_v comes from the period P
and from the first Fourier amplitude A_1, but there are statistically
significant contributions also from additional higher order components, most
importantly from A_3 and in a lesser degree from the Fourier phase phi_51. When
different colors are combined in reddening-free quantities, we obtain basically
period-luminosity-color relations. Due to the log T_eff (B-V, log g, [Fe/H])
relation from stellar atmosphere models, we would expect some dependence also
on phi_31. Unfortunately, the data are still not extensive and accurate enough
to decipher clearly the small effect of this Fourier phase. However, with the
aid of more accurate multicolor data on field variables, we show that this
Fourier phase should be present either in V-I or in B-V or in both. From the
standard deviations of the various regressions, an upper limit can be obtained
on the overall inhomogeneity of the reddening in the individual clusters. This
yields sigma_E(B-V)}< 0.012 mag, which also implies an average minimum
observational error of sigma_V > 0.018 mag.

predictions that the group velocity in transparent optical media can exceed c.
Special relativity is not violated by these phenomena. Moreover, in the
electronic domain, the causality principle does not forbid negative group
delays of analytic signals in electronic circuits, in which the peak of an
output pulse leaves the exit port of a circuit before the peak of the input
pulse enters the input port. Furthermore, pulse distortion for these
superluminal analytic signals can be negligible in both the optical and
electronic domains. Here we suggest an extension of these ideas to the
microelectronic domain. The underlying principle is that negative feedback can
be used to produce negative group delays. Such negative group delays can be
used to cancel out the positive group delays due to transistor latency (e.g.,
the finite RC rise time of MOSFETS caused by their intrinsic gate capacitance),
as well as the propagation delays due to the interconnects between transistors.
Using this principle, it is possible to speed up computer systems.

formulation and light-front quantization because this may produce a convergent
Fock-space expansion. The QCD Hamiltonian is systematically renormalized to
second order in the strong coupling and the Fock-space expansion is truncated
to lowest order to produce a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian matrix. The
renormalized Hamiltonian is used to calculate the spectra of the $b\bar{b}$ and
$c\bar{c}$ mesons as a lowest-order test of our procedure for full QCD.
  The analytic determination of the renormalized Hamiltonian matrix generates
expressions that must be numerically integrated to generate quantitative
results. The efficiency of the numerical calculation depends on how well the
basis functions can approximate the real state. We examine the effectiveness of
using Basis-Splines (B-Splines) to represent QCD states. After briefly
describing these functions, we test them using the one- and two-dimensional
harmonic oscillator problems. We test their ability to represent realistic

Chapter 2, with an introduction to the classical gravity with torsion, that
includes also interaction of torsion with matter fields. In Chapter 3, the
renormalization of quantum theory of matter fields and related topics, like
renormalization group, effective potential and anomalies, are considered.
Chapter 4 is devoted to the action of particles in a space-time with torsion,
and to possible physical effects generated by the background torsion. In
particular, we review the upper bounds for the background torsion which are
known from the literature. In Chapter 5, the comprehensive study of the
possibility of a theory for the propagating completely antisymmetric torsion
field is presented. We show, that the propagating torsion may be consistent
with the principles of quantum theory only in the case when the torsion mass is
much greater than the mass of the heaviest fermion coupled to torsion. Then,
universality of the fermion-torsion interaction implies that torsion itself has
a huge mass, and can not be observed in realistic experiments. In Chapter 6, we
briefly discuss the string-induced torsion and the possibility to induce
torsion action and torsion itself through the quantum effects of matter fields.

algebra of G, we associate a category, Coh_t. It is defined as a suitable
quotient of the category of graded modules over (a graded version of) the
deformed preprojective algebra introduced by Crawley-Boevey and Holland. The
category Coh_t should be thought of as the category of coherent sheaves on a
`noncommutative projective 2-space', equipped with a framing at the line at
infinity. Our first result establishes an isomorphism between the moduli space
of torsion free objects of Coh_t and the Nakajima quiver variety arising from G
via the McKay correspodence.
  We apply the above isomorphism to deduce generalized Crawley-Boevey & Holland
conjecture, saying that the moduli space of `rank 1' projective modules over
the deformed preprojective algebra is isomorphic to a particular quiver
variety. This reduces, for G=1, to the recently obtained parametrisation of the
isomorphism classes of right ideals in the first Weyl algebra, A_1, by points
of the Calogero-Moser space, due to Cannings-Holland and Berest-Wilson. Our
approach is algebraic and is based on a monadic description of torsion free

a situation where our proposed theory leads to a well-defined algebro-geometric

a generic disc bounding a special Lagrangian submanifold in a Calabi-Yau

whole range of values of the coupling parameter, from C=0 (uncoupled limit) up
to values close to the continuum limit (forced and damped sine-Gordon model).
As this parameter is varied, the existence of different bifurcations is
investigated numerically. Using Floquet spectral analysis, we give a complete
characterization of the most relevant bifurcations, and we find (spatial)
symmetry-breaking bifurcations which are linked to breather mobility, just as
it was found in Hamiltonian systems by other authors. In this way moving
breathers are shown to exist even at remarkably high levels of discreteness. We
study mobile breathers and characterize them in terms of the phonon radiation
they emit, which explains successfully the way in which they interact. For
instance, it is possible to form ``bound states'' of moving breathers, through
the interaction of their phonon tails. Over all, both stationary and moving
breathers are found to be generic localized states over large values of $C$,
and they are shown to be robust against low temperature fluctuations.
