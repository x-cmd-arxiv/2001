the Earth's atmosphere, they interact at high altitude with the air nuclei as
targets. By repeated interaction of the secondaries an `extensive air shower'
(EAS) is generated with huge particle numbers in the maximum of the shower
development. Such cascades are quantitatively simulated by the Monte Carlo
computer program CORSIKA. The most important uncertainties in simulations arise
from modeling of high-energy hadronic interactions: a) The inelastic hadron-air
cross sections. b) The energies occurring in EAS may extend far above the
energies available in man-made accelerators, and when extrapolating towards
higher energies one has to rely on theoretical guidelines. c) In collider
experiments which are used to adjust the interaction models the very forward
particles are not accessible, but just those particles carry most of the
hadronic energy, and in the EAS development they transport a large energy
fraction down into the atmosphere. CORSIKA is coupled alternatively with 6
high-energy hadronic interaction codes (DPMJET, HDPM, neXus, QGSJET, SIBYLL,
VENUS). The influence of those interaction models on observables of simulated
EAS is discussed.

the classicaly estimated spin-down power ~ -10^{34} erg s^{-1} exceeds the
accretion luminosity of the primary by a factor ~ 10^2 and, as a dominating
power, should lead either to observable luminosity changes or to other
detectable effects. This so-called ""spin-down problem"" can be relaxed under the
assumption that the primary is now in a phase of rapidly decreasing its
differential rotation under constant angular momentum, undergoing a
nonaxisymmetric transition (i.e., turning over its magnetic symmetry axis with

comparable to the observed luminosities and the spin-down problem is
drastically simplified. We present a detailed numerical study of such a

of Omega if there are features on scales of a few Mpc in the primordial power
spectrum. Conversely, if we know the cosmological model parameters from other

the power spectrum that are in the nonlinear regime at the present epoch, and
hence difficult to discern directly from current epoch measurements.
  We have investigated the influence of an artificially introduced Gaussian
feature on an otherwise unperturbed SCDM power spectrum. Using these modified
spectra as an input to cosmological N-body simulations, we are able to show
that in terms of the cluster abundance evolution, a SCDM model displays
characteristics similar to an OCDM model. However, strong modifications would
also be visible at a redshift z=0 in the dark matter power spectrum whereas
minor alterations to the usual SCDM spectrum are washed away by non-linear
evolution effects. We therefore conclude that features with characteristics
such as discussed here might not be detectable using observations of the galaxy
power spectrum, the local cluster abundance or the large-scale velocity field
as measured by the velocity distribution of galaxy clusters. The only quantity
that shows a pronounced difference at the present epoch between our models
under investigation is the halo-halo correlation function which appears to be
strongly biased with respect to an unmodified SCDM model. This is due to a lack
of power on certain scales which subsequently modifies the relative amplitude
of high-and low-k waves. Apart from observations of the evolution of cluster
abundance, measurements of the Lyman-alpha forest at high redshift could put
constraints on possible features in the power spectrum, too.

In this paper we present a simple analytic model which describes a star's
abundances in terms of its ``ancestry,'' i.e., the number of nucleosynthesis
events (e.g., supernova explosions) which contributed to the star's
composition. This model leads to a very simple analytic expression for the
abundance scatter versus Fe/H, which is in good agreement with the data and
with more sophisticated numerical models. We investigate two classes of
scenarios for r-process nucleosynthesis, one in which r-process synthesis
events occur in only \sim 4% of supernovae but iron synthesis is ubiquitous,
and one in which iron nucleosynthesis occurs in only about 9% of supernovae.

massive relic particles in the dark halo of the Galaxy, or they may be produced
by supermassive black holes in the nuclei of nearby galaxies. The anisotropy in
the arrival directions is studied in four dark halo models (cusped, isothermal,
triaxial and tilted) and in four galaxy samples (galaxies intrinsically
brighter than Centaurus A within 50 and 100 Mpc, and brighter than M32 within
50 and 100 Mpc). In decaying dark matter models, the amplitude of the
anisotropy is controlled by the size of the Galactic halo, while the phase is
controlled by the shape. In the northern hemisphere, the amplitude is about 0.5
for cusped haloes, but falls to roughly 0.3 for isothermal haloes. The phase
points in the direction of the Galactic Centre, with deviations of up to 30
degrees possible for triaxial and tilted haloes. The effect of the halo of M31
is too weak to provide conclusive evidence for the decaying dark matter origin
of UHECRs. In extragalactic models, samples of galaxies brighter than Centaurus
A produce substantial anisotropies (roughly 1.8), much larger than the limits
set by the available data. If all galaxies brighter than M32 contribute, then
the anisotropy is more modest (roughly 0.5) and is directed toward mass
concentrations in the supergalactic plane, like the Virgo cluster. Predictions
are made for the southern hemisphere station of the Pierre Auger Observatory.
If the UHECRs have a Galactic origin, then the phase points towards the
Galactic Centre. If they have an extragalactic origin, then it points in the
rough direction of the Fornax cluster. This provides an unambiguous
discriminant and requires about 350-500 events at South Auger.

close enough to it and none exhibits disturbances that could indicate a close

unusual absence of HI and star formation activity in the outer disk of NGC 3175

black hole mass, M_bh, and radio-luminosity. In this paper we discuss the
correlation for quasars from the FIRST Bright Quasar Survey (FBQS), using black
hole mass estimates from Hbeta linewidths. The FBQS objects fill in the gap
between the radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars in the radio-luminosity -
optical-luminosity plane, and we find that they fill the corresponding gap in
the M_bh - radio luminosity correlation. There is thus a continuous variation
of radio luminosity with M_bh, and no evidence for a ``switch'' at some set of
critical parameter values which turns on powerful radio jets. By combining the
FBQS data with that for quasars from the Palomar-Green survey we find evidence
for a dependence of radio-luminosity on accretion rate relative to the
Eddington limit, L/L_Edd, as well as on M_bh, consistent with the well-known
radio-optical correlation for radio-loud quasars. We therefore suggest a new
scheme to ``unify'' radio-loud and radio-quiet objects in which radio
luminosity scales proportional to M_bh^{1.9+/-0.2}(L/L_Edd)^{1.0} for
L/L_Edd~0.1, with an apparently weaker accretion rate dependence at low
L/L_Edd. The scatter about this relation is +/-1.1 dex, and may well hide
significant contributions from other physical effects, such as black hole spin
and radio source environment.

rotation curve. In contrast to previous analyses of this problem by Zang
(\cite{1976PhDT........26Z}) and Evans & Read (\cite{1998MNRAS.300...83E},
\cite{1998MNRAS.300..106E}), we approximate the orbits to obtain almost closed
expressions for the kernel of the integral equation governing the behaviour of
the modes. Otherwise we, like them, follow Kalnajs' programme to simultaneously
solve the Boltzmann and Poisson equations.
  We investigate the modes admitted by both the self-consistent and a cut-out
Mestel disk, the difference being that in the latter, a part of the matter in
the disk is immobilised. This breaks the self-similarity and produces a
pronouncedly different picture, both technically and in terms of the disk
properties. The self-consistent disk is governed by a Cauchy integral equation,
the cut-out disk by an integral equation that can be treated as a Fredholm
equation of the second kind.
  In general, our approximation reproduces the results of the previous works
remarkably well, yielding quantities mostly within 5% of the values reported by
Zang and Evans & Read and thus also the basic result that in a ``standard''
cut-out disk, only one-armed modes are unstable at the limit of axisymmetric
stability. In the self-consistent disk, relatively compact expressions for the
kernel allow an intuitive understanding of most of the properties of neutral
(non-rotating, non-growing) modes there. We finally show that self-consistent
Mestel disks do not admit growing or rotating modes in this sort of
stellar-dynamical analysis.

alternate supply of As2 molecules and Ga and Mn atoms made it possible to grow
single crystalline GaMnAs layers at very low substrate temperature, at which
conventional molecular beam epitaxial growth under excess As supply is not
possible due to As condensation. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy and X-ray
diffraction measurements confirmed a higher Mn content in the films grown by
this method in comparison to the GaMnAs layers grown by low temperature
molecular beam epitaxy. The lattice constant of hypothetical zinc-blende
structure MnAs is determined to be 5.9 \AA, which deviates somewhat from
previously reported values. This deviation is ascribed to growth-condition
dependent density of point defects. It is stressed that this effect must be
taken into account for any assessment of Mn content from X-ray diffraction
data.
  Magnetization measurements showed an onset of ferromagnetic ordering around
75 K for the GaMnAs layer with 10% Mn. This means that the trend of falling
Curie temperatures with increasing Mn concentrations above 5.5% is broken.

including contributions from donor and acceptor centers formed by antisite
defects and Mn doping, and increased density of magnetically active Mn ions.

the possibility of a common solution to the hierarchy and dilaton-runaway
problems. In spite of the small $g_s$, in type II string theories with gauge
interactions localized in the vicinity of NS5-branes, the standard model gauge
couplings are of order one and are associated with the sizes of compact
dimensions. At a TeV these theories exhibit higher dimensional and stringy
behavior. The models are holographically dual to a higher dimensional
non-critical string theory and this can be used to compute the experimentally
accessible spectrum and self-couplings of the little strings. In spite of the
stringy behavior, gravity remains weak and can be ignored at collider energies.
The Damour-Polyakov mechanism is an automatic consequence of our scenario and
suggests the presence of a massless conformally-coupled scalar, leading to
potentially observable deviations from Einstein's theory, including violations

of causal perturbation theory. It is divided into two parts. In the first part
we analyze the gauge structure of a massless self-interacting quantum tensor
field. We look at this theory from a pure field theoretical point of view
without assuming any geometrical aspect from general relativity. To first order
in the perturbation expansion of the $S$-matrix we derive necessary and
sufficient conditions for such a theory to be gauge invariant, by which we mean
that the gauge variation of the self-coupling with respect to the gauge charge
operator $Q$ is a divergence in the sense of vector analysis. The most general
trilinear self-coupling of the graviton field turns out to be the one derived
from the Einstein-Hilbert action plus coboundaries and divergences.
  In the second part of this work (sect.9) we consider a massive scalar field
coupled to gravity. We are interested in the long range behaviour of this
theory. Radiative corrections for two particle scattering are investigated in
the adiabatic limit, where the cutoff of the interaction at infinity is
removed. We compute the differential cross section for graviton bremsstrahlung
in which one of the scattered particles emits a graviton of low energy. It is
shown that such processes are logarithmically divergent in the adiabatic limit.
Furthermore we show that the differential cross section for two particle
scattering with a graviton self-energy insertion is finite in the adiabatic
limit while for matter self-energy it is logarithmically divergent, too.

the Boolean product of states. Thus the product states for the main types of

Therefore, this approach can be viewed as a unification of independence. We

isoscalar-dipole strength from the physical response and the conservation of
the vector current. A powerful new relation is introduced to quantify the
violation of the vector current in terms of various ground-state form-factors.

a high-energy component that is sensitive to the size of the nucleus and scales
with the compressibility of the model and (ii) a low-energy component that is
insensitivity to the nuclear compressibility. A fairly good description of both

system and its controller. We show under which conditions measurements, state
preparations, and unitary implementations on the system can be performed by
quantum operations on the controller only.
  It turns out that a measurement of the observable A and an implementation of
the one-parameter group exp(iAr) can be performed by almost the same sequence
of control operations. Furthermore measurement procedures for A+B, for (AB+BA),
and for i[A,B] can be constructed from measurements of A and B. This shows that
the algebraic structure of the set of observables can be explained by the Lie
group structure of the unitary evolutions on the joint Hilbert space of the
measuring device and the measured system.
  A spin chain model with nearest neighborhood coupling shows that the border
line between controller and system can be shifted consistently.
