the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO). The northern part of OMC-3 is found to be
particularly rich in new X-ray features; four hard X-ray sources are located in
and along the filament of cloud cores. Two sources coincide positionally with
the sub$mm$-$mm$ dust condensations of MMS 2 and 3 or an outflow radio source
VLA 1, which are in a very early phase of star formation. The X-ray spectra of
these sources show an absorption column of (1-3) x 10^23 H cm-2. Assuming a
moderate temperature plasma, the X-ray luminosity in the 0.5-10 keV band is
estimated to be ~10^30 erg s^-1 at a distance of 450 pc. From the large
absorption, positional coincidence and moderate luminosity, we infer that the
hard X-rays are coming from very young stellar objects embedded in the
molecular cloud cores. We found another hard X-ray source near the edge of the
dust filament. The extremely high absorption of 3 x 10^23 H cm^-2 indicates
that the source must be surrounded by dense gas, suggesting that it is either a
YSO in an early accretion phase or a Type II AGN (e.g. a Seyfert 2), although
no counterpart is found at any other wavelength. In contrast to the hard X-ray
sources, soft X-ray sources are found spread around the dust filaments, most of
which are identified with IR sources in the T Tauri phase.

accretion disc. The two-dimensional hydrodynamics in the disc plane is followed
by a grid-based numerical simulation including the vertically integrated
magnetic forces. The 3--dimensional magnetic field outside the disc is
calculated in a potential field approximation from the magnetic flux density
distribution in the disc. For uniformly rotating discs we confirm numerically
the existence of the interchange instability as predicted by Spruit, Stehle &
Papaloizou (1995). In agreement with predictions from the shearing sheet model,
discs with Keplerian rotation are found to be stabilized by the shear, as long
as the contribution of magnetic forces to support against gravity is small.
When this support becomes significant, we find a global instability which
transports angular momentum outward and allows mass to accrete inward. The
instability takes the form of a $m=1$ rotating `crescent', reminiscent of the
purely hydrodynamic nonlinear instability previously found in
pressure-supported discs. A model where the initial surface mass density
$\Sigma(r)$ and $B_{\mathrm{z}}(r)$ decrease with radius as power laws shows
transient mass accretion during about 6 orbital periods, and settles into a
state with surface density and field strength decreasing approximately
exponentially with radius. We argue that this instability is likely to be the
main angular momentum transport mechanism in discs with a poloidal magnetic
field sufficiently strong to suppress magnetic turbulence. It may be especially
relevant in jet-producing discs.

observed with the BeppoSAX satellite in a very bright state. The continuum
emission is well modeled with a power law that steepens at high energies, with
an e-folding energy of about 120 keV. At soft energies a clear excess of
emission is detected, which can not be explained solely by the extended thermal
halo seen in a ROSAT HRI image. A second, more intense soft X-ray component,
possibly related to an accretion disk, is required by the data. Both a
reflection component (R=0.3) and an iron line (EW \sim 50) are detected, at
levels much weaker than in Seyfert galaxies, suggesting a common origin.
Combining our measurements with results from the literature we find that the
iron line has remained approximately constant over 9 years while the continuum
varied by a factor of 5. Thus the fluorescent gas does not respond promptly to
the variations of the X-ray primary source, suggesting that the reprocessing
site is located away, likely at parsec distances. While the continuum shape
indicates that X-rays derive from a thermal Comptonization process, the
weakness of other spectral features implies that either the upper layers of the
optically thick accretion disk are completely ionized or the corona above the
disk is outflowing with mildly relativistic velocity.

N83B displays a turbulent environment typical of newborn massive star formation
sites. It contains an impressive ridge, likely created by a shock and a cavity
with an estimated age of only ~30,000 yr, sculpted in the ionized gas by the
powerful winds of massive stars. The observations bring to light two compact
HII blobs, N83B-1 and N83B-2, and a small arc-nebula, N83B-3, lying inside the
larger HII region. N83B-1, only ~2.8"" (0.7 pc) across, is the brightest and

The equations are applicable to clean as well as dirty superconductors for an

European Union is a key policy issue. In particular, a substantial degree of
convergence is needed if the European Central Bank is to be capable of setting
a monetary policy which is appropriate to the stage of the cycle of the Euro
zone economies.
  We consider the annual rates of real GDP growth on a quarterly basis in the
large core economies of the EU (France, Germany and Italy, plus the
Netherlands) over the period 1978Q1 - 2000Q3. An important empirical question
is the degree to which the correlations between these growth rates contain true
information rather than noise. The technique of random matrix theory is able to
answer this question, and has been recently applied successfully in the physics
journals to financial markets data.
  We find that the correlations between the growth rates of the core EU
economies contain substantial amounts of true information, and exhibit
considerable stability over time. Even in the late 1970s and early 1980s, these
economies moved together closely over the course of the business cycle. There
was a slight loosening at the time of German re-unification, but the economies
are now, if anything, even more closely correlated.
  In contrast, the results obtained with a data set of the EU core plus the UK
show no such trend. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the UK economy did
exhibit some degree of correlation with those of the core EU. However, there is
no clear evidence to suggest that the UK business cycle has moved more closely

are enhanced in the large volume limit. For instance, the picture of space
filling sponges seems to survive in the large volume limit at T>0, while
entropic effects play a crucial role in determining the free-energy degeneracy
of our finite volume states. All of our analysis is applied to equilibrium
configurations obtained by a parallel tempering on 512 different disorder
realizations. First, we consider the spatial properties of the sites where
pairs of independent spin configurations differ and we introduce a modified
spin overlap distribution which exhibits a non-trivial limit for large L.
Second, after removing the Z_2 (+-1) symmetry, we cluster spin configurations
into valleys. On average these valleys have free-energy differences of O(1),
but a difference in the (extensive) internal energy that grows significantly
with L; there is thus a large interplay between energy and entropy
fluctuations. We also find that valleys typically differ by sponge-like space
filling clusters, just as found previously for low-energy system-size
excitations above the ground state.

finding the best fit, to a given lattice gauge field, by a thin vortex

We then compare the fits achieved in Gribov copies generated by (i)
over-relaxation; (ii) over-relaxation after Landau gauge preconditioning; and
(iii) simulated annealing. Simulated annealing yields the best fit if all links
on the lattice are included, but the situation changes if we consider only the
lattice volume exterior to P-plaquettes. In this exterior region, the fit is
best for Gribov copies generated by over-relaxation, and worst for Gribov
copies generated after Landau gauge preconditioning. The two fitting criteria
(including or not including the P-plaquettes) yield string tensions differing
by -34% to +20% respectively, relative to the full string tension. Our usual
procedure (``quenched minimization'') seems to be a compromise between these
criteria, and yields string tensions at an intermediate value close to the full
string tension.

the gradient of the equilibrium dust charge density and is associated with the
finite charging time of the dust grains. The present calculations, carried out
in the generalized hydrodynamic viscoelastic formalism, also bring out
important modifications in the threshold and growth rate of the instability due
to collective effects associated with coupling to the compressional mode.

down for pressures exceeding 3 atm. In contrast, the maximum gain in Ne was
found to increase with pressure, reaching a value of 100,000 at 7 atm. The
results obtained are of particular interest for developing noble gas-based
cryogenic particle detectors for solar neutrino and dark matter search.

  non-stationary signal analysis and applications","16 pages 9 figures",,"10.1121/1.1477932",,"physics.flu-dyn",,"  It is known that ultrasound techniques yield non-intrusive measurements of
hydrodynamic flows. For example, the study of the echoes produced by a large
number of particle insonified by pulsed wavetrains has led to a now standard
velocimetry technique. In this paper, we propose to extend the method to the
continuous tracking of one single particle embedded in a complex flow. This
gives a Lagrangian measurement of the fluid motion, which is of importance in
mixing and turbulence studies. The method relies on the ability to resolve in
time the Doppler shift of the sound scattered by the continuously insonfied
particle.
  For this signal processing problem two classes of approaches are used:
time-frequency analysis and parametric high resolution methods. In the first
class we consider the spectrogram and reassigned spectrogram, and we apply it
to detect the motion of a small bead settling in a fluid at rest. In more
non-stationary turbulent flows where methods in the second class are more
robust, we have adapted an Approximated Maximum Likelihood technique coupled
with a generalized Kalman filter.

of N atoms coupled to M modes inside a coherently driven high-finesse cavity.
The description includes momentum diffusion via spontaneous emission and cavity
decay. Simple analytical formulas for the steady-state temperature and the
cooling time for a single atom are derived and show surprisingly good agreement
with direct stochastic simulations of the semiclassical equations for N atoms
with properly scaled parameters. A thorough comparison with standard free-space
Doppler cooling is performed and yields a lower temperature and a cooling time
enhancement by a factor of M times the square of the ratio of the atom-field
coupling constant to the cavity decay rate. Finally it is shown that laser
cooling with negligible spontaneous emission should indeed be possible,
especially for relatively light particles in a strongly coupled field
configuration.

  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) gedanken experiment is sufficient to
demonstrate quantum entanglement.
  A further set of measurable criteria sufficient to demonstrate EPR gedanken
experiment is proposed, these being the set of criteria sufficient to
demonstrate entanglement, by way of a measured violation of a necessary
condition of separability. In this way, provided the spatial separation of
systems is sufficient to ensure EPR's locality hypothesis, it is shown how a
measured demonstration of entanglement will, at least, be equivalent to a
demonstration of the EPR gedanken experiment. Using hidden variables it is
explained how such demonstrations are a direct manifestation of the
inconsistency of local realism with quantum mechanics.
