the resolution must be increased from 1 to 0.25 cm^-1 at both temperatures

the width of the infrared peaks. Several bands observed at 295 K split at 3.5
K. At 3.5 K the widths of isolated single bands in olivine, enstatites and

dependence of lambda_pk and bandwidth shows promise as a means to deduce
characteristic temperatures of mineralogically distinct grain populations. In

accretion rate, the bolometric luminosity, the optical luminosity and the size
of the Broad Line Region (BLR) in Active Galactic Nuclei, using recent
observational data obtained from monitoring campaigns. We show that a standard
accretion disc cannot account for the observed optical luminosity, unless it
radiates at super-Eddington rates. This implies the existence of another,
dominant emission mechanism in the optical range, or a non standard disc (non
stationary, ADAF and/or strong outflows). Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies
(NLS1s) are most extreme in this context: they have larger bolometric to
Eddington luminosity ratios than Broad Line Seyfert 1 (BLS1s), and most likely
a larger ""non disc"" component in the optical range. From realistic simulations
of self-gravitating $\alpha$-discs, we have systematically localized the
gravitationally unstable disc and shown that, given uncertainties on both the
model and observations, it coincides quite well with the size of the BLR. We
therefore suggest that the gravitationally unstable disc is the source which
releases BLR clouds in the medium. However the influence of the ionization
parameter is also required to explain the correlation found between the size of
the BLR and the luminosity. In this picture the size of the BLR in NLS1s
(relative to the black hole size) is larger (and the emission line width
smaller) than in BLS1s simply because their Eddington ratio is larger.

X-3 with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). The objects divide into two
classes. In the first class, exemplified by Cyg X-1, luminosity and spectral
hardness evolve simultaneously. In the second class, the relation is more
complicated: the softest spectra occur while the count rate is dropping. Most
models of accretion, tailored to Cyg X-1, do not predict the second sort of
behavior. One interpretation is a simple model with two simultaneous,
independent accretion flows: a thin disk and a hot halo. A drop in the
accretion rate affecting both flows would propagate through the halo
immediately but might take up to several weeks to propagate through the disk.
While the inner halo is thus temporarily depleted compared to the disk, a
temporary soft state is expected. This picture is supported by the observation
that those sources which show delays (1E 1740.7-2942, GRS 1758-258, and GX
339-4) are expected to have low-mass companions, and those which do not (Cyg
X-1, Cyg X-3) are known or thought to have high-mass companions. Low-mass
companions imply accretion by Roche-lobe overflow, with a high specific angular
momentum in the accreting material, and therefore a large disk with a long
viscous timescale. Wind accretion from massive companions is expected to result
in a much smaller disk, and thus little viscous delay.

data are compatible with a moderately collimated fireball (with opening angle

attributed to the transition of the fireball to a non-relativistic expansion.
This transition predicts a{\it flattening} of the light curve, that explains
the late X-ray measurement in excess above the extrapolation of the simple jet
scenario, and is also consistent with optical data.

milli-arcsecs. This structure is consistent with a bipolar outflow from the
star. From a study of the variability of the intensity and position spectra we
argue that a combination of magnetically-driven bipolar outflow and accreting
gas contribute to the H-alpha emission. On the other hand, the [OI] and [SII]
emission are displaced from the star to the south-west but at much larger
distances than the H-alpha, hundreds of milli-arcsecs for the high-velocity
component (HVC) and down to 30 milli-arcsecs for the low-velocity components
(LVC). The presence of both red-shifted and blue-shifted outflows in H-alpha
but only a blue-shifted outflow in the forbidden lines can be explained if the
disc obscures the red-shifted forbidden line outflow, but a disc gap with outer
radius 3-4 au allows the red-shifted H-alpha to be seen. This gap could be
induced by an unseen companion.

We find that the unknown thickness of the hydrogen layer of white dwarfs in

the few sparse available observational constraints - about the unknown mass and
thickness of the hydrogen layer for the cluster white dwarfs, a realistic
estimate of the systematic error on the distance is within +-0.10 mag. However,
particular combinations of white dwarf masses and envelope thicknesses - which
at present cannot be excluded a priori - could produce larger errors.
Contamination of the cluster DA sequence by non-DA white dwarfs introduces a
very small systematic error of about -0.03 mag in the Mv/(V-I) plane, but in
the Mv/(B-V) plane the systematic error amounts to ~ +0.20 mag. Contamination

we note that the standard Z_2 gauge theory is a generalised quantum dimer

between remaining unpaired electrons results in a quasi long-range
superconductivity: Superconducting correlations decay very slowly as
$x^{-\eta}$ with $\eta\approx 1/2$. This process is reminiscent of the coupling
of fermions to preformed bosonic pairs introduced in the context of high-Tc

the standard model fields forms the boundary of a 5-dimensional AdS bulk (the

gravitons, the formation of the bulk black hole, and the holographic AdS/CFT
definition of the RSII theory. Our detailed calculation of bulk radiation
reduces previous estimates to a phenomenologically acceptable, although
potentially visible level. In late cosmology, in which the Friedmann equation
depends linearly on the energy density \rho, only about 0.5% of energy density
is lost to the black hole or, equivalently, to the `dark radiation'
(\Omega_{d,N} \simeq 0.005 at nucleosynthesis). The preceding, unconventional
\rho^2 period can produce up to 5% dark radiation (\Omega_{d,N} <\sim 0.05).
The AdS/CFT correspondence provides an equivalent description of late RSII
cosmology. We show how the AdS/CFT formulation can reproduce the \rho^2
correction to the standard treatment at low matter density. However, the
4-dimensional effective theory of CFT + gravity breaks down due to higher
curvature terms for energy densities where \rho^2 behaviour in the Friedmann
equation is usually predicted. We emphasize that, in going beyond this energy
density, the microscopic formulation of the theory becomes essential. For
example, the pure AdS_5 and string-motivated AdS_5\timesS^5 definitions differ
in their cosmological implications.

  V2 corr: thm4.1c",,,,"math.GM",,"  Constant Rank (CR) state machines play an important role in the general
structure theory of Finite State Machines. A machine is of constant rank if
each input and input-sequence maps the state set onto the same number of next
states. CR-machines are analysed via their sequential closure (semigroup),
which is a simple semigroup, thus: a semi- direct product (L \times R)*G of a
left- and a right-copy semigroup, and a group. . . . So in general a CR-machine
is a composition of: a branch-, a reset- and a permutation machine, which are
three of the five basic types of state machines, to be derived.

  updated bibliography",,,,"math.GR math.CO",,"  Geometric approach to classical and exceptional groups of Lie type has been
quite successful and has led to the deveopment of the concept of buildings and
polar spaces. The latter have been characterized by simple systems of axioms
with a combinatorial-geometric flavour. Similar to buildings geometries can be
associated with finite sporadic simple groups (FSSGs). However, most of the
known characterizations of such geometries for FSSGs require additional
assumptions of a group-theoretic nature. One aim of this thesis is to present
characterizations of geometries for FSSGs J_2, Suz, McL, Co_3, Fi(22), Fi(23),
Fi(24) and He, which are in the same spirit as the characterizations of
buildings and polar spaces mentioned above, in particular without any
assumption on the automorphism groups of the geometries. A by-product of these
results for J_2, Suz and He is a proof that certain presentations for those
groups are faithful. Most of this work may be viewed as a contribution to the
theory of graphs with prescribed neighbourhood. The result on graphs of
(+)-points of GF(3)-orthogonal spaces, which is also used for characterization
of geometries for Fi(22), Fi(23) and Fi(24), may be considered as a
generalization of a well-known theorem on locally co-triangular graphs.
Hyperovals of polar spaces are natural generalizations of hyperovals of
projective planes of even order and play an important role in investigations of
extensions of polar spaces. As a by-product new extended generalized
quadrangles were found as hyperovals of the polar spaces Q_5^+(4) and H_5(4).

subsheaf of positive Kodaira dimension. As a corollary one finds that U can not
be a complete intersection in the projective N space of codimension l < N/2,
nor the complement of l general hyperplanes, for l < N. Moreover, as shown by
S. Kovacs before, U can not be a projective manifold with a nef tangent bundle.
  If the induced morphism to the moduli scheme is generically finite, one can
also exclude U to be the product of more than n curves. Moreover, the existence
of the family forces the automorphism group of U to be finite.

regarded as a ""soft"" cellular space. The interaction results into the emergence
of elementary excitations of space - inertons - surrounding the particle. It is
assumed that such a motion leads not only to the spatial oscillation of the
particle along a path but to the oscillation of the particle centre-of-mass as
well. This phenomenon culminating in the anisotropic pulsation of the particle
is associated with the notion of spin. The particle-space interaction is
treated as the origin of the matter waves, which are identified with the
particle inertia and inertons surrounding the moving particle are considered as
carriers of its inert properties. Inertons are also identified with real
carriers of the gravitational interaction and the range of the particle
gravitational potential is evaluated by the inerton cloud amplitude
$\Lambda=\lambda c/v$, where $\lambda$ is the de Broglie wavelength, $c$ and
$v$ are the velocity of light and the particle respectively. The nature of the

Vagner and Kventsel, and by Kane, with the new idea of nuclear-spin qubit
interactions mediated indirectly via the bound outer electrons of impurity
atoms whose nuclear spins 1/2 are the qubits. These electrons, in turn,
interact via the two-dimensional electron gas in the quantum Hall effect
regime. The resulting quantum computing scheme retains all the gate-control and
measurement aspects of the proposal by Kane, but allows qubit spacing at
distances of order 100 nm, attainable with the present-day
semiconductor-heterostructure device technologies.
