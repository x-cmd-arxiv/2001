  figs",,"10.1086/322149",,"astro-ph",,"  Over the past decade, microlensing has developed into a powerful tool to
study stellar astrophysics, especially stellar atmospheres, stellar masses, and
binarity. I review this progress. Stellar atmospheres can be probed whenever
the source in a microlensing event passes over the caustic (contour of infinite
magnification) induced by the lens because the caustic effectively resolves the
source. Broad-band observations of four events have yielded limb-darkening
measurements, which in essence map the atmospheric temperature as a function of
depth. And now, for the first time, spectroscopic observations of one event
promise much richer diagnostics of the source atmosphere. In the past two
years, a practical method has finally been developed to systematically measure
the lens masses in microlensing events. This will permit a census of all
massive objects, both dark and luminous, in the Galactic bulge, including
low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. The
method combines traditional ground-based photometry with astrometric and
photometric measurements by the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) in solar
orbit. Using a related technique SIM can also obtain accurate (>~ 1%) mass
measurement of a dozen or so nearby stars, thus enabling precision tests of
stellar models. Binary lenses can give rise to dramatic and easily detectable
microlensing signatures, even for large mass ratios. This makes microlensing a
potentially powerful probe of the companion mass distribution, especially in
the Galactic bulge where this function is difficult to probe by other
techniques.

clarified the nature of the objects as background galaxies or extended objects

sample typical LMC background galaxies are nearby (4000 < V(km/s) < 6000),
while SMC's are considerably more distant (10000 < V(km/s) < 20000). We
determine the reddening in each line of sight by matching a reddening-free
galaxy template with comparable stellar population. For the LMC main body we
derive a combined Milky Way and internal reddening value E(B-V)$_{MW+i}$ =
0.12$\pm$0.10, while for the SMC E(B-V)$_{MW+i}$ = 0.05$\pm$0.05. By
subtracting Milky Way reddening values for galaxies projected onto the
surroundings of each Cloud, we estimate average internal reddening values
$\Delta$E(B-V)$_i$ = 0.06 and 0.04, respectively for the main bodies of the LMC
and SMC. The Clouds are optically thin, at least in the directions of the
studied background galaxies which are often difficult to be identified as such
on ESO/SERC sky survey images. Nevertheless, more reddened zones may occur
where it is difficult to identify galaxies.

massive X-ray binary 4U2206+54 has opened the possibility that it is a Be/X-ray
binary with an unusually close orbit, which, together with its low intrinsic
luminosity, suggests that the system is actually a Be + WD binary, in which a
white dwarf accretes material from the dense circumstellar disc surrounding a
classical Be star. In this paper we present new X-ray observations and for the
first time high-resolution optical spectroscopy of the source. We show that
both the X-ray behaviour and the characteristics of the optical counterpart, BD
+53 2790, are more consistent with a neutron star accreting from the wind of an
early-type star. The X-ray lightcurve shows irregular flaring and no
indications of pulsations, while the very high hydrogen column density supports
accretion from a dense wind. BD +53 2790 is shown not to be a classical Be
star, as believed until now, but rather a very peculiar late O-type active
star, exhibiting emission components in the HeII lines, complex spectral
variability and strong wind resonance lines in the ultraviolet. Though many of
the characteristics of the spectrum resemble those of the He-rich stars, the
absence of HeI variability makes a connection unlikely. The spectrum is
compatible with a composite of two stars of similar spectral type, though
circumstantial evidence points to a single very peculiar active early-type
star. This adds weight to the growing evidence that the traditional
subdivisions of supergiant and Be/X-ray binaries fail to cover the whole
phenomenology of massive X-ray binaries.

slower than speeds of the primary stellar bars. This spectacular decoupling of
nuclear bars from the underlying gravitational potential is triggered but is
not driven by the gas viscosity. We find that low-viscosity systems can spend a
substantial period of time in a fully decoupled state, with the nuclear bar
slowly tumbling in the gravitational field of the primary bar. Higher viscosity
systems form nuclear bars which librate about the primary bar. The shape of a
nuclear bar, i.e., its eccentricity, correlates strongly with the angle between
the bars. We also find that such decoupling, partial or full, most probably
will be associated with bursts of star formation and with gas inflow across the
inner (Lindblad) resonance zone towards smaller radii.

recent, high-resolution simulations of galaxy-sized Cold Dark Matter (CDM)
halos. Over two and a half decades in radius the phase-space density closely
follows a power-law, $\rho/\sigma^3 \propto r^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha =
1.875$. This behaviour matches the self-similar solution obtained by
Bertschinger for secondary infall in a uniformly expanding universe. On the
other hand, the density profile corresponding to Bertschinger's solution (a
power-law of slope $r^{2\alpha-6}$) differs significantly from the density
profiles of CDM halos. We show that isotropic mass distributions with power-law
phase-space density profiles form a one-parameter family of structures
controlled by $\kappa$, the ratio of the velocity dispersion to the peak
circular velocity. For $\kappa=\alpha=1.875$ one recovers the power-law
solution $\rho \propto r^{2\alpha-6}$. For $\kappa$ larger than some critical
value, $\kappa_{cr}$, solutions become non-physical, leading to negative
densities near the center. The critical solution, $\kappa =\kappa_{cr}$, has
the narrowest phase-space density distribution compatible with the power-law
phase-space density stratification constraint. Over three decades in radius the
critical solution is indistinguishable from an NFW profile. Our results thus
suggest that the NFW profile is the result of a hierarchical assembly process
that preserves the phase-space stratification of Bertschinger's infall model
but which ``mixes'' the system maximally, perhaps as a result of repeated
merging.

transitive closure into the problem of reevaluating polynomials over matrices.
With this technique, we improve the best known bounds for fully dynamic
transitive closure. In particular, we devise a deterministic algorithm for
general directed graphs that achieves $O(n^2)$ amortized time for updates,
while preserving unit worst-case cost for queries. In case of deletions only,
our algorithm performs updates faster in O(n) amortized time.
  Our matrix-based approach yields an algorithm for directed acyclic graphs
that breaks through the $O(n^2)$ barrier on the single-operation complexity of
fully dynamic transitive closure. We can answer queries in $O(n^\epsilon)$ time
and perform updates in $O(n^{\omega(1,\epsilon,1)-\epsilon}+n^{1+\epsilon})$
time, for any $\epsilon\in[0,1]$, where $\omega(1,\epsilon,1)$ is the exponent
of the multiplication of an $n\times n^{\epsilon}$ matrix by an
$n^{\epsilon}\times n$ matrix. The current best bounds on
$\omega(1,\epsilon,1)$ imply an $O(n^{0.58})$ query time and an $O(n^{1.58})$
update time. Our subquadratic algorithm is randomized, and has one-side error.

the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem for Dirac operators on manifolds with

associated to $K^1$ representatives on even dimensional manifolds, which should
be of independent interests. For example, it gives an intrinsic interpretation
