WR86, WR146, and WR147, obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
on board the Hubble Space Telescope. The systems are classified as follows:
WR86 = WC7 + B0 III, WR146 = WC6 + O8 I-IIf, WR147 = WN8 + O5-7 I-II(f). Both
WR146 and WR147 are known to have strong non-thermal radio emission arising in
a wind-wind collision shock zone between the WR and OB components. We find that
the spectra of their O companions show Halpha profiles in emission, indicative
of large mass-loss rates, and consistent with the colliding-wind model. Our
spectra indicate that the B component in WR86 has a low mass-loss rate, which
possibly explains the fact that WR86, despite being a long period WR+OB binary,
was not found to be a strong non-thermal radio emitter. Because of the small
mass-loss rate of the B star component in WR86, the wind collision region must
be closer to the B star and smaller in effective area, hence generating smaller
amounts of non-thermal radio emission. Absolute magnitudes for all the stars
are estimated based on the spectral types of the components (based on the
tables by Schmidt-Kaler for OB stars, and van der Hucht for WR stars), and
compared with actual, observed magnitude differences. While the derived
luminosities for the WC7 and B0 III stars in WR86 are consistent with the
observed magnitude difference, we find a discrepancy of at least 1.5 magnitudes
between the observed luminosities of the components in each of WR146 and WR147
and the absolute magnitudes expected from their spectral types. In both cases,
it looks as though either the WR components are about 2 magnitudes too bright
for their spectral types, or that the O components are about 2 magnitudes too
faint. We discuss possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy.

cosmologically distant source based on the Press-Gunn approximation that the
lensing objects are uniformly and randomly distributed in the intervening space
with a constant comoving density. Here we investigate more realistic
cosmological microlensing statistics by considering the strong spatial
clustering of likely lensing objects with each other in galaxies and their
association with the clumps of dark matter that make up the massive halos of
galaxies. The distribution of microlensing optical depth (kappa) along randomly
chosen sight lines is calculated as is the conditional distribution of kappa
along sight lines near one which is strongly microlensed. Our overall result is
that the Press-Gunn approximation is a useful order-of-magnitude approximation
if the massive halos of galaxies are made of dark compact objects but that it
fails badly and can be qualitatively misleading in the more likely case in
which only the ordinary stellar populations of galaxies are the dominant source
of cosmological microlensing events. In particular, we find that microlensing
by stars is limited to of order 1 percent of high redshift sources at any one
time. Furthermore, even though only a small fraction of high redshift sources
are multiply-imaged (by galaxies), it is these sources that are most likely to
be microlensed by stars. Consequently, microlensing by stars is usually
observed at kappa's near 1 where the simple isolated point mass lens
approximation is not appropriate. However, if CDM halos are composed of
condensed objects, then more than 10 percent of high redshift sources are
microlensed at any given time. The vast majority of these sources are not
multiply-imaged, and have kappa's smaller than 0.01.

nebulae, defined by their ``rotating'' spiral dust shells observed in the
infrared. This morphology is naturally explained by dust formation associated
with colliding winds in a binary system. In order to confirm and further
explore this hypothesis, we have observed the known pinwheel nebulae (WR 104

wavelengths with the Very Large Array to search for non-thermal radio emission
from colliding winds. The spectrum of each target is nearly flat between 5 and
22 GHz, consistent with the presence of non-thermal emission that is reduced at
low frequencies by free-free absorption. This emission must lie outside the
radio ``photosphere,'' leading us to estimate a lower limit to the physical
size of the non-thermal emitting region that is larger than expected from
current theory. Based on a radio and infrared comparison to WR 104 and 98a, we
conclude that WR 112 is a likely candidate pinwheel nebula, but its temporal
variability indicates an eccentric binary orbit or a pinwheel viewed nearly
edge-on. A sensitive radio survey of IR-bright WRs would stringently test the
hypothesis that colliding winds lie at the heart of_all_ dusty WR systems. We
also discuss the effects of dust obscuration in the ultra-violet and how

the halo of NGC 253, a nearby edge-on starburst galaxy driving a galactic
superwind. The arcsecond spatial resolution of the Chandra ACIS instrument
allows us to study the spatial and spectral properties of the diffuse X-ray
emitting plasma with greatly superior spatial and spectral resolution compared
to previous X-ray instruments. We find statistically significant structure
within the X-ray diffuse emission on angular scales down to ~10 arcsec (~130
pc). There is no statistically significant evidence for any spatial variation
in the spectral properties of the diffuse emission, over scales from ~400 pc to
\~3 kpc. We show that the X-shaped soft X-ray morphology of the superwind,
previously revealed by ROSAT, is matched by very similar X-shaped H-alpha
emission, extending at least 8 kpc above the plane of the galaxy. In the
northern halo the X-ray emission appears to lie slightly interior to the
boundary marked by the H-alpha emission. The total 0.3-2.0 keV energy band
X-ray luminosity of the northern halo, L_X ~ 5e38 erg/s, is very similar to the
halo H-alpha luminosity of L_Ha ~ 4e38 erg/s, both of which are a small
fraction of the estimated wind energy injection rate of ~1e42 erg/s from
supernovae in the starburst. We show that there are a variety of models that
can simultaneously explain spatially-correlated X-ray and H-alpha emission in
the halos of starburst galaxies. These findings indicate that the physical
origin of the X-ray-emitting million-degree plasma in superwinds is closely
linked to the presence of much cooler and denser T ~ 1e4 K gas, not only within
the central kpc regions of starbursts, but also on ~10 kpc-scales within the
halos of these galaxies. (Abridged)

plausible assumptions, the Hipparcos catalog should contain about 30 f_{fail}
astrometric binaries with black-hole companions, where f_{fail} is the fraction
of supernovae that fail. Since no black-hole astrometric binaries are found in
Hipparcos, one might like to conclude that such failed supernovae are very
rare. However, the most important assumption required for this argument, the

strong soft X-ray emission, and the overall shape of the SED indicate that
emission from the accretion disk peaks between 15 and 100 eV. High resolution
FUSE spectra showing UV absorption due to O VI and the lack of detectable X-ray
absorption in the Chandra spectrum demonstrate the presence of a low column
density of highly ionized gas along our line-of-sight. The highly-ionized state

potential,
  V_o=-M_{BH}/(r^{2}+e^{2})^{1/2} with r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}. Attention
focuses on three issues related to the properties of ensembles of chaotic
orbits which impact on chaotic mixing and the possibility of constructing
self-consistent equilibria: (1) What fraction of the orbits are chaotic? (2)
How sensitive are the chaotic orbits, i.e., how large are their largest (short

impeded by Arnold webs, i.e.,, how `sticky' are the chaotic orbits? These
questions are explored as functions of the axis ratio a:b:c, black hole mass
M_BH, softening length e, and energy E with the aims of understanding how the
manifestations of chaos depend on the shape of the system and why the black
hole generates chaos. The simplicity of the model makes it amenable to a
perturbative analysis. That it mimics the behaviour of more complicated

by interactions. A case is made for intragroup gas in poor and compact groups

are highlighted, and it is suggested that ram pressure may be able to reconcile

  Physics","48 pages, 2 figures, plain TeX",,,,"astro-ph",,"  I show that the mutual consistency of the Bekenstein Bound, the Standard
Model (SM) of particle physics, and general relativity implies that the
universe began in a unique state. I solve the coupled EYM equations for this
unique state, show how the horizon problem is solved, and how SM baryogenesis
naturally results from the triangle anomoly. Since the SU(2) winding number
state is thus non-zero, the universe is not in the QCD ground state, and this
plausibly yields a (small) positive cosmological constant. Since the initial
state is unique, it is necessarily homogeneous and isotropic, as required by
the Bekenstein Bound. Wheeler-DeWitt quantization implies an $S^3$ cosmology
must be very close to flat if the universe is to be classical today. I show
that the spectrum of any classical gauge field (or interacting massless scalar
field) in a FRW universe necessarily obeys the Wien displacement law and the
corresponding quantized field the Planck distribution law with the reciprocal
of the scale factor playing the role of temperature, even if the fields have
zero temperature. Thus the CBR could even today be a pure SU(2) electroweak
field at zero temperature coupled to the Higgs field, in spite of early
universe inverse double Compton and thermal bremsstrahlung.Such a CBR would not
couple to right-handed electrons, and this property can be detected with a
Penning trap or even using the late 1960's CBR detector with appropriate
filters. I argue that ultrahigh energy (UHE) Genesisf.tex Genesisf.tex cosmic
ray protons would not produce pions by interacting with such a CBR, and thus
the existence of such protons may constitute an observation of this CBR
property.

relaxation of the beam via the faster electrostatic turbulence, the beam is
still unstable with respect to the electromagnetic waves, thus providing the
isotropization required for efficient production of radiation. While the

undispersed photons (i.e. those detected in the zeroth-order). A
previously-unknown X-ray source is detected approx 6 arcsec (1.1 h_{75}^{-1}
kpc) NNE of the nucleus (position angle approx 29 degrees) which we designate
CXOU 110648.1+723412. Its spectrum can be characterized as a power law with a
photon index Gamma ~ 1.8--2.6, or as thermal emission with a temperature
kT~0.7--3 keV. Assuming a location within NGC 3516, isotropic emission implies
a luminosity L ~ 2--8e39 h_{75}^{-2} erg s^{-1} in the 0.4--2 keV band. If due
to a single point source, the object is super-Eddington for a 1.4 M_sun neutron
star. However, multiple sources or a small, extended source cannot be excluded
using the current data. Large-scale extended X-ray emission is also detected
out to ~10 arcsec (~1.7 h_{75}^{-1} kpc) from the nucleus to the NE and SW, and
is approximately aligned with the morphologies of the radio emission and
extended narrow emission line region (ENLR). The mean luminosity of this
emission is 1--5e37 h_{75}^{-2} erg s^{-1} arcsec^{-2}, in the 0.4--2 keV band.
Unfortunately the current data cannot usefully constrain its spectrum. These
results are consistent with earlier suggestions of circumnuclear X-ray emission
in NGC 3516. If the extended emission is due to scattering of the nuclear X-ray

of magnitude too small to provide the confining medium for the ENLR clouds.

Fe positions, and viceversa) has recently been shown to have a dramatic
influence in their magnetic and magnetotransport properties. In the present
study, two polycrystalline Sr2FeMoO6 samples showing different degrees of
anti-site disorder (a nominally 'ordered' sample with 70% of cationic ordering
and a nominally 'disordered' sample with 18% of cationic ordering) have been
examined by magnetic measurements and neutron powder diffraction (NPD)
techniques in the 15-500K temperature range. Our main finding is that the
'disordered' sample exhibits a strong magnetic scattering (noticeable even at
500K), comparable to that displayed by the 'ordered' one below TC= 415 K. For
the 'disordered' sample, the magnetic scattering exhibited on low angle Bragg
positions, is not to be ascribed to a (non-existent) ferrimagnetic ordering:
our results suggest that it originates upon naturally-occurring groups of Fe
cations in which strong antiferromagnetic (AFM) Fe-O-Fe superexchange
interactions are promoted, similar to those existing in the LaFeO3 perovskite.
These Fe groups are not magnetically isolated, but coupled by virtue of Fe-O-Mo
AFM interactions, which maintain the long-range coherence of this AFM
structure. Susceptibility measurements confirm the presence of AFM interactions
below 770 K.

as power law corrections may emerge at higher orders in perturbation theory.
This fact might have important implications on the determination of WIMP relic
densities. On the other hand, the definition of number densities in a
interacting theory is not a straightforward procedure. It usually requires
renormalization of composite operators and operator mixing, which obscure the
physical interpretation of the computed thermal average. We propose a new
definition for the thermal average of a composite operator, which does not
require any new renormalization counterterm and is thus free from such
ambiguities. Applying this definition to the annihilation model of Matsumoto
and Yoshimura we find that it gives number densities which are
Boltzmann-suppressed at any order in perturbation theory. We discuss also heavy
particles which are unstable already at T=0, showing that power law corrections
do in general emerge in this case.

studied. The analytical calculations are performed in the semiclassical
approximation combined with the geometrical theory of diffraction. Non diagonal

  The numerical calculations are performed for a self adjoint extension of a

  We calculate the angle dependent diffraction constant for an arbitrary

(compared to the wavelength of the particles that in turn is small compared to
the size of the billiard). The relation to the idealized model of the
$\delta$-like scatterer is formulated. The angle dependent diffraction constant
is used for the analytic calculation of the form factor to the order $\tau^2$.
If the scatterer is at a typical position, the form factor is found to reduce
(in this order) to the one found for angle independent diffraction. If the
scatterer is at the center, the large degeneracy in the lengths of the orbits
involved leads to an additional small contribution to the form factor,
resulting of the angle dependence of the diffraction constant. The robustness

  PSN#THAP030","eConf C011127 (2001) THAP030",,,"physics.acc-ph physics.ins-det",,"  This paper reports on Matlab Channel Access (MCA) Toolbox Matlab [1]
interface to Epics Channel Access (CA) client library. We are developing the
toolbox for SPEAR3 accelerator controls but it is of general use for
accelerator and experimental physics applications programming. It is packaged
as Matlab toolbox to allow easy development of complex CA client applications
entirely in Matlab. The benefits include: the ability to calculate and display
parameters that use Epics process variables as inputs, availability of Matlab
graphics tools for user interface design, and integration with Matlab-based
accelerator modeling tool Matlab Accelerator Toolbox. Another purpose of this
paper is to propose a feasible path to a synergy between accelerator control
systems and accelerator simulation codes, the idea also known as on-line
accelerator model.

technologies in biology today. In the {\sl GeneChip} system, the reconstruction
of the target concentration depends upon the differential signal generated from
hybridizing the target RNA to two nearly identical templates: a perfect match
(PM) and a single mismatch (MM) probe. It has been observed that a large
fraction of MM probes repeatably bind targets better than the PMs, against the
usual expectation from sequence-specific hybridization; this is difficult to
interpret in terms of the underlying physics. We examine this problem via a
statistical analysis of a large set of microarray experiments. We classify the
probes according to their signal to noise ($S/N$) ratio, defined as the
eccentricity of a (PM, MM) pair's `trajectory' across many experiments. Of
those probes having large $S/N$ ($>3$) only a fraction behave consistently with
the commonly assumed hybridization model. Our results imply that the physics of
DNA hybridization in microarrays is more complex than expected, and they
suggest new ways of constructing estimators for the target RNA concentration.

and a 10 m long wiggler for short wavelength Free Electronic Laser (FEL)
development. The original control system [1] was based on the one in use at the
National Synchrotron Light Source. In 2000 the control system was upgraded to
be based on EPICS to facilitate software interfaces for extensions at all
levels. The FEL began commissioning in May 2001. The upgraded control systems
have been stable, reliable and easy to operate. An overview of the control
systems, including for the linac, the waveform digitizer controls, video
system/image processing and radiation monitor/alarms will be presented.

Opt. 4, 155 (2002)","10.1088/1464-4266/4/2/312",,"quant-ph",,"  A generalized Mach-Zehnder-type interferometer equipped with cross-Kerr
elements is proposed to convert N-photon truncated single-mode quantum states
into (N+1)-mode single-photon states, which are suitable for further state
manipulation by means of beam splitter arrays and ON/OFF-detections, and vice
versa. Applications to the realization of unitary and non-unitary
transformations, quantum state reconstruction, and quantum telemanipulation are
studied.

;2k,f>_F which is a linear superposition of the 2k-quantum nonlinear coherent
states. Unlike in usual states where an ellipse is the symbol of squeezing, a
4k-winged flower results in the fan state. We first derive the analytical
expression of squeezing for arbitrary k, N, f and then study in detail the case
of a laser-driven trapped ion characterized by a specific form of the nonlinear
function f. We show that the lowest order in which squeezing may appear and the
number of directions along which the amplitude may be squeezed depend only on k
whereas the precise directions of squeezing are determined also by the other
physical parameters involved. Finally, we present a scheme to produce such
fan-states.
