inflation begins because the cosmological constant is not unnaturally small. It
ends through the accumulated gravitational interaction between virtual
gravitons which are ripped apart by the inflationary expansion. Although
perturbative techniques can be used to study the effect as long as it remains
weak, they break down when back-reaction begins to exert an appreciable effect
on the expansion rate. In this talk I argue that the end of inflation is sudden
and that there is actually an overshoot into deflation. (This incidentally
provides a very efficient mechanism for reheating.) The subsequent evolution
can be understood in terms of a competition between the opening of the past
light cone and the formation of a thermal barrier to the persistence of

estimated to delta MW \approx 7 MeV and delta sin^2(theta_eff) \approx 7 x

two sigma models, whose target spaces are moduli spaces of Yang-Mills

asymptotic expansions for the monic and orthonormal polynomials outside the
interval $[-1,1]$, for the recurrence coefficients and for the leading
coefficients of the orthonormal polynomials. We also deduce asymptotic behavior
for the Hankel determinants. For the asymptotic analysis we use the steepest
descent technique for Riemann--Hilbert problems developed by Deift and Zhou,
and applied to orthogonal polynomials on the real line by Deift, Kriecherbauer,
McLaughlin, Venakides, and Zhou. In the steepest descent method we will use the
Szeg\H{o} function associated with the weight and for the local analysis around
the endpoints $\pm 1$ we use Bessel functions of appropriate order, whereas
Deift et al. use Airy functions.

worked out. Mirror Principle, as developed by three of the current authors in
the series of work [L-L-Y1, I, II, III, IV], is a method for studying certain
intersection numbers on a stable map moduli space. As an application, in Mirror
Principle III, Sec 5.4, an outline was given in the case of genus zero with
target a flag manifold. The results on $S^1$ fixed points in this paper are
used here to do explicit Mirror Principle computations in the case of
Grassmannian manifolds. In fact, Mirror Principle computations involve only a
certain distinguished subcollection of the $S^1$-fixed-point components. These
components are identified and are labelled by Young tableaus. The
$S^1$-equivariant Euler class $e_{S^1}$ of the normal bundle to these
components is computed. A diagrammatic rule that allows one to write down
$e_{S^1}$ directly from the Young tableau is given. From this, the
aforementioned intersection numbers on the moduli space of stable maps can be
worked out. Two examples are given to illustrate our method. Using our method,
the A-model for Calabi-Yau complete intersections in a Grassmannian manifold
can now also be computed explicitly. This work is motivated by the intention to
provide further details of mirror principle and to understand the relation to
physical theory. Some related questions are listed for further study.

dominating set of $G$. It is well known that every graph without isolated
vertices has $dom(G) \geq 2$. For every $k$, it is known that there are graphs
with minimum degree at least $k$ and with $dom(G)=2$. In this paper we prove
that this is not the case if $G$ is $k$-regular or {\em almost} $k$-regular (by
``almost'' we mean that the minimum degree is $k$ and the maximum degree is at
most $Ck$ for some fixed real number $C \geq 1$). In this case we prove that
$dom(G) \geq (1+o_k(1))k/(2\ln k)$. We also prove that the order of magnitude
$k/\ln k$ cannot be improved. One cannot replace the constant 2 with a constant
smaller than 1. The proof uses the so called {\em semi-random method} which
means that combinatorial objects are generated via repeated applications of the
probabilistic method; in our case iterative applications of the Lov\'asz Local
Lemma.

scales smaller than the Taylor microscale, and stop near the dissipative scale.

third moment to a good description of the level density, as well as

surface science community, one for powder and surface diffraction and computed
micro-tomography, and the last one for protein crystallography. All of them are
equipped with insertion devices, which users want to treat as active

The theory of the survival probability is manifestly related to the parametric
theory of the local density of states (LDOS). In this Paper we demonstrate that
in spite of the common ""ideology"", the physics of quantum irreversibility is
{\em not} trivially related to the parametric theory of the LDOS. Rather, it is
essential to take into account subtle cross correlations which are not captured
