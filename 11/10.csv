that although inflation can (and generically does) continue eternally into the

``steady-state'' model with no initial time. Here we provide a construction
that circumvents these theorems and allows a self-consistent, geodesically
complete, and physically sensible steady-state eternally inflating universe,
based on the flat slicing of de Sitter space. This construction could be used
as the background space-time for creation events that form big-bang-like
regions, and hence could form the basis for a cosmology that is compatible with
observations and yet which avoids an initial singularity or beginning of time.

find that for a large set of prior cosmological models the Croft et al. result
holds quite well, with systematic errors being comparable to random ones, when
a dependence of the recovered matter power spectrum on the cosmological
parameters at z~3 is taken into account. We find that peculiar velocities cause
the flux power spectrum to be smoothed over about 100-300 km/s, dependng on
scale. Consequently, the recovered matter power spectrum is a smoothed version
of the underlying true power spectrum. Uncertainties in the recovered power
spectrum are thus correlated over about 100-300 km/s. As a side effect, we find
that residual fluctuations in the ionizing background, while having almost no
effect on the recovered matter power spectrum, significantly bias estimates of
the baryon density from the Lyman-alpha forest data. We therefore conclude that
the Croft et al. result provides a powerful new constraint on cosmological
parameters and models of structure formation.

greater than 10e7 solar masses in the Milky Way halo. However, we know of only
a dozen dwarf satellites close to this mass. Are these lumps simply lacking in
stars or is there a fundamental flaw in our most popular cosmology? By studying
the tidal debris of known satellites we can potentially address this question.
In this paper, we quantify the the effects of the dark matter lumps on tidal
tails. The lumps scatter stars in the tidal tails from their original orbits
producing a distinctive signature. We simulate debris evolution in smooth and
lumpy halos potentials and use our simulations to motivate and test a
statistical measure of the degree of scattering apparent in the angular
position and radial velocity measurement of debris stars - the ``scattering
index''. We find that the scattering index can in general distinguish between
the levels of substructure predicted by CDM cosmologies and smooth Milky Way
models, but that the sensitivity of the debris depends on the orientation of
the parent satellite's orbit relative to the largest lumps orbits.
  We apply our results to the carbon star stream associated with the
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr) and find that these stars appear to be more
scattered than we expect for debris orbiting in a smooth halo. However, the
degree of scattering is entirely consistent with that expected due to the
influence of the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is on an orbit that intersects
Sgr's own. We conclude that the current data is unable to constrain CDM models.
Nevertheless, our study suggests that future data sets of debris stars
associated with other Milky Way satellites could provide strong constraints on
CDM models.

three-dimensional space. The algorithm computes radiation source and sink terms
using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method, based on a formulation in which
the integral of any quantity (such as emissivity or opacity) over any volume
may be written in the classic convolution form. The algorithm is fast with the
computational time scaling as N (log N)^2, where N is the number of grid points
of a simulation box, independent of the number of radiation sources.
Furthermore, in this formulation one can naturally account for both local
radiation sources and diffuse background as well as any extra external sources,
all in a self-consistent fashion. Finally, the algorithm is completely stable
and robust.
  While the algorithm is generally applicable, we test it on a set of problems
that encompass a wide range of situations in cosmological applications,
demonstrating that the algorithm is accurate. These tests show that the
algorithm produces results that are in excellent agreement with analytic
expectations in all cases. In particular, radiation flux is guaranteed to
propagate in the right direction, with the ionization fronts traveling at the
correct speed with an error no larger than one cell for all the cases tested.
The total number of photons is conserved in the worst case at 10% level and
typically at 1-5% level over hundreds of time steps. As an added advantage, the
accuracy of the results depends weakly on the size of the time step, with a
typical cosmological hydrodynamic time step being sufficient.

that can attain densities large enough for gravitational collapse. In galaxies
with a turbulent interstellar medium, this fraction is controlled by the
effective barotropic index $gamma = dlog P/dlog (rho)$ which measures the
turbulent compressibility. When the cooling timescale is smaller than the
dynamical timescale, gamma can be evaluated from the derivatives of cooling and
heating functions, using the condition of thermal equilibrium. We present
calculations of gamma for protogalaxies in which the metal abundance is so
small that H_2 and HD cooling dominates. For a heating rate independent of
temperature and proportional to the first power of density, the turbulent gas
is relatively ""hard"", with $gamma >= 1$, at large densities, but moderately
""soft"", $gamma <= 0.8$, at densities below around $10^4 cm^(-3)$. At low
temperatures the density probability distribution should fall ra pidly for
densities larger than this value, which corresponds physically to the critical
density at which collisional and radiative deexcitation rate s of HD are equal.
The densities attained in turbulent protogalaxies thus depend on the relatively
large deuterium abundance in our universe. We expect the same physical effect
to occur in higher metallicity gas with different coolants. The case in which
adiabatic (compressional) heating due to cloud collapse dominates is also
discussed, and suggests a criterion for the maximum mass of Population III
stars.

which is spatially coincident with the lens system. Based on multi-object
spectroscopy taken at the Keck 10-m telescope, we have confirmed ten group
members with a mean redshift of <z> = 0.2909. The resulting velocity dispersion

To describe this
phenomenon we apply to the probabilistic model regarding the jam emergence as
the formation of a large car cluster on highway. In these terms the breakdown
occurs through the formation of a certain critical nucleus in the metastable
vehicle flow, which enables us to confine ourselves to one cluster model. We
assume that, first, the growth of the car cluster is governed by attachment of
cars to the cluster whose rate is mainly determined by the mean headway
distance between the car in the vehicle flow and, may be, also by the headway
distance in the cluster. Second, the cluster dissolution is determined by the
car escape from the cluster whose rate depends on the cluster size directly.
The latter is justified using the available experimental data for the
correlation properties of the synchronized mode. We write the appropriate
master equation converted then into the Fokker-Plank equation for the cluster
distribution function and analyze the formation of the critical car cluster due
to the climb over a certain potential barrier. The further cluster growth
irreversibly gives rise to the jam formation. Numerical estimates of the
obtained characteristics and the experimental data of the traffic breakdown are
compared. In particular, we draw a conclusion that the characteristic intrinsic
time scale of the breakdown phenomenon should be about one minute and explain
the case why the traffic volume interval inside which traffic breakdown is

applications. The base design uses two independent Texas Instrument (TI)
TMS320C6711, which are 900 MFLOPS floating-point digital signal processors
(DSP). Applications that require a fixed point DSP can be implemented by
replacing the baseline DSP with the pin-for-pin compatible TMS320C6211. The
design can be manufactured with a reduced chip set without redesigning the
printed circuit board. For example it can be implemented as a single-channel
DSP with no analog I/O.

framework that is distributed over some 325 computers throughout the NIF
facility. The framework provides templates and services at multiple levels of
abstraction for the construction of software applications that communicate via
CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture). Various forms of
object-oriented software design patterns are implemented as templates to be
extended by application software. Developers extend the framework base classes
to model the numerous physical control points, thereby sharing the
functionality defined by the base classes. About 56,000 software objects each
individually addressed through CORBA are to be created in the complete ICCS.
Most objects have a persistent state that is initialized at system start-up and
stored in a database. Additional framework services are provided by centralized
server programs that implement events, alerts, reservations, message logging,
database/file persistence, name services, and process management. The ICCS
software framework approach allows for efficient construction of a software
system that supports a large number of distributed control points representing
a complex control application.

Recently WA98 presented the first data on direct photons in Pb+Pb-collisions at
SPS. At the same time RHIC started with its experimental program. The discovery
of the QGP in these experiments relies on a comparison of data with theoretical
predictions for QGP signals. In the case of direct photons new results for the
production rates of thermal photons from the QGP and a hot hadron gas as well
as for prompt photons from initial hard parton scatterings have been proposed
recently. Based on these rates a variety of different hydrodynamic models,
describing the space-time evolution of the fireball, have been adopted for
calculating the direct photon spectra. The results have been compared to the
WA98 data and predictions for RHIC and LHC have been made. So far the
conclusions of the various models are controversial.
  The aim of the present review is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date
survey and status report on the experimental and theoretical aspects of direct

power of UML lies in Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools such as
Rational Rose, which are also capable of generating software structures from
visual object definitions and relations. UML also allows add-ons that define
specific structures and patterns in order to steer and automate the design
process. We have developed an add-on called Control System Modeling Language
(CSML). It introduces entities and relationships that we know from control
systems, such as ""property"" representing a single controllable point/channel,
or an ""event"" specifying that a device is capable of notifying its clients
through events. Entities can also possess CSML-specific characteristics, such
as physical units and valid ranges for input parameters. CSML is independent of
any specific language or technology and generic such that any control system
can be described with it. Simple transformation scripts map CSML defined
structures to APIs and tools such as EPICS, CDEV, SCADA, Abeans, BACI and
generate the appropriate database or source files. Advantages of control system
development with CSML are discussed on a concrete example of a bending magnet's

EPICS process variables (PV) are requested by client applications, all
front-end computers receive the broadcasts and perform name resolution
processing against local channel name lists. The nameserver is used to offload
the name resolution task to a single node. This processing, formerly done on
all front-end computers, is now done only by the nameserver. In a control

segmented appropriately, allowing a broken element to be quickly identified and
repaired while leaving the balance of the system available. In a research and
development environment, the control system must meet the frequently changing
requirements of a variety of customers. This means the system must be flexible
enough to allow for ongoing modifications with minimal disruptions to
operations. Beyond the hardware and software elements of the control system,
appropriate workflow processes must be in place to maximize system uptime and

possible before. At these intensities, particles, electrons and protons,
acquire kinetic energy in the mega-electron-volt range through interaction with
intense laser fields. This opens a new age for the laser, the age of nonlinear

associated with electric dipole active (magnetic dipole active) BECs in a
vortex state are evaluated for an infinite- and a finite-length cylindrical
BEC. The predictd monopole charge distributions, both electric and magnetic,
automatically satisfy the requirement of global charge neutrality and the
derivations highlight the exact symmetry between the electric and magnetic
properties. Order of magnitude estimates of the effects are given for an atomic
gas BEC, superfluid helium and a spin-polarised hydrogen BEC.

particle whose time evolution is determined by a positive Hamiltonian will
violate causality. We argue that this apparent paradox is resolved for a free
particle described by either the Dirac equation or the Klein-Gordon equation
because such a particle cannot be localized in the sense required by the
theorems.

constant degeneracy and with finite sum of the squares of the reciprocal of its
eigenvalues and whose eigenvectors span the entire Hilbert space there exists a
characteristic self-adjoint time operator which is canonically conjugate to the
Hamiltonian in a dense subspace of the Hilbert space. Moreover, we show that
each characteristic time operator generates an uncountable class of self-
adjoint operators canonically conjugate with the same Hamiltonian in the same
dense subspace.

proposed for the Hilbert's tenth problem, we consider two further classes of
mathematically non-decidable problems, those of a modified version of the
Hilbert's tenth problem and of the computation of the Chaitin's $\Omega$
number, which is a representation of the G\""odel's Incompletness theorem. Some
interesting connection to Quantum Field Theory is pointed out.
