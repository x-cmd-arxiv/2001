resolved at the milliarcsec scale into two components which have a combined

becoming resolved out by the higher MERLIN resolution. We have investigated
possible causes of radio emission from a wind environment, both directly from

with the very efficient high resolution echelle spectrograph VLT/UVES. Although
this is a very challenging observational program for a Southern hemisphere
telescope (the galaxy is located at +36 deg declination), high resolution
spectra (FWHM ~ 26 km/s) have revealed, with unprecedented detail along a
galaxy sight line, the Lyman-alpha forest due to intervening clouds in the
intergalactic medium (IGM). The mean depression D_A due to IGM absorption
blueward of the galaxy Ly-alpha wavelength and the number density dn/dz of
Ly-alpha clouds have been compared with equivalent results obtained for QSO
sight lines at similar redshifts. Our results indicate a possible excess of
absorption close to the galaxy. The mean depression at ~ 150 h_65^-1 Mpc
comoving (Omega_m=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7) from the galaxy is D_A=0.36+/-0.03, to
be compared with 0.22+/-0.04, expected from a best fit to QSO sight lines. In
the same region (z=2.610), the number density of lines with HI column density
in excess of 10^14 atoms/cm2 is also about 3 sigma larger than expected. This
high density region is at least 60 h_65^-1 Mpc comoving wide, but the large
Ly-alpha absorption of the galaxy itself prevents us from detecting a possible
structure extending down to the galaxy. This excess of Ly-alpha clouds is
suggestive of two possible scenarios. One is the presence of a super cluster of
Ly-alpha clouds not associated with cB58. The other is a high density of gas
associated with the environment of cB58. Indeed, a hint of the complexity of
cB58 and possibly its environment is given by the huge velocity range (almost

2.35); zero metallicity stars; or narrow-lined active galactic nuclei. The

star-formation in high redshift galaxies is episodic or the Lyman-alpha

of faint galaxies in the HDF and the HDF--S WFPC2 and NICMOS fields. We find
that (1) previous measurements have missed a dominant fraction of the
ultraviolet luminosity density of the universe at high redshifts by neglecting
cosmological surface brightness dimming effects, which are important at
redshifts larger than z = 2, (2) the incidence of the highest intensity star
forming regions increases monotonically with redshift, and (3) the ultraviolet
luminosity density plausibly increases monotonically with redshift through the
highest redshifts observed. By measuring the spectrum of the luminosity density
versus redshift, we also find that (4) previous measurements of the ultraviolet
luminosity density at redshifts z < 2 must be reduced by a factor 2 to allow
for the spectrum of the luminosity density between rest-frame wavelengths 1500
and 2800 A. And by comparing with observations of high-redshift damped
Lyman-alpha absorption systems detected toward background QSOs, we further find
that (5) the distribution of star formation rate intensities matches the
distribution of neutral hydrogen column densities at redshifts z = 2 through 5,
which establishes a quantitative connection between high-redshift galaxies and
high column density gas and suggests that high-redshift damped Lyman-alpha
absorption systems trace lower star formation rate intensity regions of the

cores and jets in recent years, specifically focusing on the large population
of low-luminosity AGN. Special attention is also given to Sgr A*, the
supermassive black hole candidate at the Galactic Center, whose radio
properties are reviewed in more detail. This source exhibits a submm-bump,
possibly from an ultra-compact region around the black hole which should allow
imaging of the event horizon of the black hole in the not too distant future. A
jet model is proposed which explains the basic feature of Sgr A*: its slightly
inverted radio spectrum, the submm-bump, the lack of extended emission, and the
X-ray emission. This model also works for famous sources like M81*, NGC4258, or
GRS1915+105 based on the argument that radio cores are jets whose emission can
be scaled with the accretion power over many orders of magnitude. This scaling
is corroborated by the detection of many Sgr A*-like radio cores in nearby
Low-Luminosity AGN (LLAGN), some of which show jet structures on the VLBI (Very
Long Baseline Interferometry) scale. These cores confirm an AGN origin of about
half of the known low-luminosity AGN classified as LINERs and dwarf-Seyferts.
It is argued that in fact most of the compact radio emission at centimeter
waves in LLAGN is produced by a compact radio jet and not an Advection
Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF). In general one can say that compact radio
cores are a genuine feature of AGN, allowing one to precisely pinpoint black
holes in many galaxies - not only in luminous quasars.

suggest that elliptical galaxies are, like disk galaxies, embedded in massive
dark matter halos. Stellar kinematics are considered the most important tracer
for this dark halo at a few effective radii. Using detailed modeling
techniques, several authors have recently presented stellar kinematical
evidence of a dark halo for a number of elliptical galaxies. In these modeling
techniques, dust attenuation (absorption and scattering of starlight by dust
grains) has not been taken into account. Nevertheless, elliptical galaxies
contain a significant amount of interstellar dust, which affects all observable
quantities, including the observed kinematics. We constructed a set of
dynamical models for elliptical galaxies, in which dust attenuation is included
through a Monte Carlo technique. We find that a dust component, shallower than
the stellar distribution and with an optical depth of order unity, affects the
observed kinematics significantly, in the way that it mimics the presence of a
dark halo. If such dust distributions are realistic in elliptical galaxies, we
are faced with a new mass-dust degeneracy. Taking dust into account in
dynamical modeling procedures will hence reduce or may even eliminate the need
for a dark matter halo at a few effective radii.

have obtained J,H,K', and N (10.8 micron) images of the nuclear region of the
starburst galaxy He 2-10. The N-band images were obtained with the Gemini North
telescope and reveal four of the five enshrouded clusters, or ""ultradense HII
regions"" (UDHIIs), recently discovered in radio maps. None of these sources
appears in either the optical HST images or the near-infrared images. They
comprise about 60% of the total N-band flux from He 2-10 and, we suspect, a
similar fraction of the total far infrared flux measured by IRAS. The inferred
spectra of the UDHIIs are very similar to those of Galactic ultracompact HII
regions and we have modeled the UDHIIs under the assumption that they are
""scaled-up"" versions of these objects. The bolometric luminosity of the
brightest UDHII is estimated to be ~2x10^9 L_sun, and the total mass of the
dust and gas is ~10^7 M_sun. The mass of the enshrouded stellar cluster must be
> 2.5x10^6 M_sun and the age must be < 4.8x10^6 yr. All of the stellar clusters
within the UDHIIs must have ages less than about 5x10^6 yr and masses greater
than about 5x10^5 M_sun. The logarithmic ratios of the radio to far infrared
flux densities for the individual UDHIIs, and He 2-10 as a whole, are
significantly larger than the average for normal galaxies, but comparable to
those for ultraluminous infrared galaxies. Large ratios for some starburst
galaxies may indicate that a significant fraction of the far infrared flux
arises from UDHIIs. If all of the far infrared flux from He 2-10 and other
starbursts is produced by heavily obscured regions, the observed correlation
between UV continuum slope and infrared-to-ultraviolet flux ratio in starbursts
cannot be due primarily to UV reprocessing by dust in a foreground screen.

with redshifts 0.1-1. The galaxies were selected from the FORS Deep Field with
a limiting magnitude of R=23. Spatially resolved rotation curves were derived
from spectra obtained with FORS2 at the VLT. High-mass galaxies with v_max>=150
km/s show little evolution, whereas the least massive systems in our sample are
brighter by about 1-2 mag compared to their local counterparts. For the entire
distant sample, the TFR slope is flatter than for local field galaxies
(-5.77+-0.45 versus -7.92+-0.18). Thus, we find evidence for evolution of the
slope of the TFR with redshift on the 3-sigma level. This is still true when we
subdivide the sample into three redshift bins. We speculate that the flatter
tilt of our sample is caused by the evolution of luminosities and an additional
population of blue galaxies at z>=0.2. The mass dependence of the TFR evolution
also leads to variations for different galaxy types in magnitude-limited
samples, suggesting that selection effects can account for the discrepant
results of previous TFR studies on the luminosity evolution of late-type

probable age of 11+-2 Gyrs, this is the first attempt to establish the absolute

for the cluster to that of other globular clusters of similar metallicities.
Mainly the comparisons have been with regards to NGC6553 and 47Tuc. With the
new metallicity determinations for individual stars in both NGC6553 and NGC6528
it is now clear that 47Tuc (at -0.71 dex) has a significantly lower metallicity
than NGC6528 and NGC6553 and is thus not a suitable comparison cluster as
regards differential age determinations. A comparison with the fiducial line
for NGC6553 confirms results in earlier studies, e.g. Ortolani et al. (1995),
that the two clusters indeed have very similar ages. From the measured
velocities both the proper motion of the cluster and the velocity dispersion in
the Galactic bulge are found. NGC 6528 is found to have a proper motion
relative to the Galactic bulge of mu_l=0.006 and mu_b=0.044 arcsec per century.

less in the mid-infrared than in the near-infrared, with decreasing amplitude

occurs, $T_1^{-1}$ exhibited the tendency of divergence near $T_{\rm N}$, and
this feature was ascribed to the transverse spin fluctuation associated with
the mode softening at the $K$-point. It was found that the damping constant of
the soft mode is remarkably affected by the occurrence of the magnetic ordering
at lower temperature, and increases largely in the field region where the phase

(CFGE) is studied by a Brownian dynamics (BD) simulation method which we have
developed. The method simulates electrophoresis of DNA in a 3 dimensional (3D)
space by a chain of electrolyte beads of hard spheres. Under the constraint
that the separation of each pair of bonded beads is restricted to be less than
a certain fixed value, as well as with the excluded volume effect, the Langevin
equation of motion for the beads is solved by means of the Lagrangian
multiplier method. The resultant mobilities, $\mu$, as a function of the
electric field coincide satisfactorily with the corresponding experimental
results, once the time, the length and the field of the simulation are properly
scaled. In relatively strong fields quasi-periodic behavior is found in the
chain dynamics, and is examined through the time evolution of the radius of the
longer principal axis, $R_l(t)$. It is found that the mean width of a peak in
$R_l(t)$, or a period of one elongation-contraction process of the chain, is
proportional to the number of beads in the chain, $M$, while the mean period
between two such adjacent peaks is proportional to $M^0$ for large $M$. These
results, combined with the observation that the chain moves to the field
direction by the distance proportional to $M$ in each elongation-contraction
motion, yield $\mu \propto M^0$. This explains why CFGE cannot separate DNA
according to their size $L (\propto M)$ for large $L$.

beads} (s-beads) is explicitly introduced in our BD model. In equilibrium under
a vanishing field the distance between s-beads and their hopping range are
found to be randomly distributed following a Poisson distribution. In the
strong field range, where a chain undergoes the elongation-contraction motion,
s-beads are observed to be alternatively annihilated in elongation and created
in contraction of the chain. On the other hand, the distribution of hopping
range of s-beads does not differ much from that in equilibrium. The results
indicate that the motion of the chain elongated consists of a huge number of
random movements of s-beads. We have also confirmed that these features of
s-beads agree qualitatively with those of s-monomers in the extended bond
fluctuation model (EBFM) which we recently proposed. The coincidence of the two
simulations strongly supports the stochastic semi-local movement of s-monomers
which we {\it a priori} introduced into the EBFM.

phase-breaking scattering times. The wire resistance as a function of the wire
length $L$, coherence length $L_{\phi}$, and localisation length $\xi$ is

fluctuates from wire to wire with a characteristic log-normal distribution of
resistances, the typical resistance increases as $\exp(L/\xi)$, and the mean
resistance increases as $\exp(2L/\xi)$ (or faster if disorder is strong). As

narrows the resistance distribution. As a result, at $L \gg L_{\phi}$ the mean

Extensive experience has been gained by integrating controls in the prototype
laser preamplifier laboratory. The control system installed in the preamplifier
lab contains five of the ten planned supervisory subsystems and seven of
sixteen planned front-end processors (FEPs). Beam alignment, timing, diagnosis
and laser pulse amplification up to 20 joules was tested through an automated
series of shots. Other laboratories have provided integrated testing of six
additional FEPs. Process measurements including earned-value, product size, and

special role. But it is well known that mechanics can be formulated so as to
treat the time variable on the same footing as the other variables in the
extended configuration space. Such covariant formulations are natural for
relativistic gravitational systems, where general covariance conflicts with the
notion of a preferred physical-time variable. The standard presentation of
quantum mechanics, in turns, gives again time a very special role, raising well
known difficulties for quantum gravity. Is there a covariant form of
(canonical) quantum mechanics? We observe that the preferred role of time in
quantum theory is the consequence of an idealization: that measurements are
instantaneous. Canonical quantum theory can be given a covariant form by
dropping this idealization. States prepared by non-instantaneous measurements
are described by ""spacetime smeared states"". The theory can be formulated in
terms of these states, without making any reference to a special time variable.
The quantum dynamics is expressed in terms of the propagator, an object
covariantly defined on the extended configuration space.

different ``distances'' from the earth are physically different with respect to

measurements are physically inhomogeneous. This has caused fundamental errors
in gravitation, cosmology and astrophysics. The true transformations between
basic parameters of bodies located in different field positions, derived from
just experimental facts, are used to test fundamental hypotheses in current
literature. G fields do not exchange energy with bodies and radiation, but just
momentum. The G energy comes the bodies. The average relative distances and
cosmological redshifts in the universe cannot change after universe expansion
because the average increase of distances (G potentials) would change the sizes
of particles in identical proportion. Locally, atoms must be evolving,
indefinitely, in closed cycles between states of gas and linear black hole. The
last ones, after recovering energy, must explode thus regenerating gas. Most of
the universe must be in state of black galaxy cooled down by linear black
holes. They must account for the CMBR. The new scenarios are also explained by
using particle models consistent with the EP.

agreement with the experimental result, \alpha_s^{exp} = 0.117 \pm 0.002,

conventional supersymmetric grand unification, \alpha_s^{SGUT} = 0.130 \pm
0.004 \pm \Delta_{SGUT}. There is a simultaneous solution to the three
outstanding problems of 4D supersymmetric grand unified theories: a large mass
splitting between Higgs doublets and their color triplet partners is forced,
proton decay via dimension five operators is automatically forbidden, and the
absence of fermion mass relations amongst light quarks and leptons is
guaranteed, while preserving the successful m_b/m_\tau relation. The theory
necessarily has a strongly coupled top quark located on a fixed point and part

description of strongly interacting, nonsupersymmetric matter within the
framework of dynamical Abelian projection and centerization. The underlying
gauge symmetry is assumed to be $SU(N+1)$ with $N \gg 1$. Appealing to a
thermodynamical treatment, the ground-state structure of the model is
classically determined by a potential for the inflaton field (dynamical
monopole condensate) which allows for nontrivially BPS saturated and thereby
stable solutions. For $T<M_P$ this leads to decoupling of gravity from the
inflaton dynamics. The ground state dynamics implies a heat capacity for the
vacuum leading to inflation for temperatures comparable to the mass scale $M$
of the potential. The dynamics has an attractor property. In contrast to the
usual slow-roll paradigm we have $m\gg H$ during inflation. As a consequence,
density perturbations generated from the inflaton are irrelevant for the
formation of large-scale structure, and the model has to be supplemented with
an inflaton independent mechanism for the generation of spatial curvature
perturbations. Within a small fraction of the Hubble time inflation is
terminated by a transition of the theory to its center symmetric phase. The
spontaneously broken $Z_{N+1}$ symmetry stabilizes relic vector bosons in the
epochs following inflation. These heavy relics contribute to the cold dark
matter of the universe and potentially originate the UHECRs beyond the GZK
bound.

to be toroidal in all nine spatial dimensions and is filled with a gas of
$p$-branes. The dynamics of winding modes allow, at most, three spatial
dimensions to become large, providing a possible explanation to the origin of
our macroscopic (3+1)-dimensional universe. Specific solutions are found within
the model that exhibit loitering, i.e. the universe experiences a short phase
of slow contraction during which the Hubble radius grows larger than the

solution to the brane problem (generalised domain wall problem) in BGC and the

exponentially fast decaying two body interaction. The model was introduced by
M. Kac and G. Baker to investigate the phenomenon of phase transition in
systems with weak long-range interactions like van der Waals gas. Ruelle's
dynamical zeta function for this model can be expressed in terms of Fredholm
determinants of two transfer operators and hence is a meromorphic function. One
of the two operators, found by M. Kac, is an integral operator with symmetric
kernel acting in the Hilbert space of square integrable functions on the line.
The other one is Ruelle's transfer operator acting in some Banach space of
holomorphic observables of the system. In this paper we show how the Kac
operator can be explicitly related basically through the Segal-Bargmann
transform to the Ruelle operator restricted to a certain Segal-Bargmann space
of entire functions in the complex plane. This allows us to show that Ruelle's
zeta function for the Kac-Baker model has infinitely many ""non-trivial"" zeros
on the real axis. In a special case we can show the existence of also
infinitely many ""trivial"" zeros on the line Re s = ln 2 in the complex s-plane.

decay of correlations is. In particular, for non-ergodic and non-mixing

different and faster decay of fidelity is predicted on a time scale 1/delta as
opposed to mixing dynamics where the fidelity is found to decay exponentially

show the results of the study of pattern and defect formation and dynamics in a
Type II degenerate optical parametric oscillator for which the pump field is
not resonated in the cavity. We find that traveling waves are the predominant
solutions and that the defects are vectorial dislocations which appear at the
boundaries of the regions where traveling waves of different phase or
wave-vector orientation are formed. A dislocation is defined by two topological
charges, one associated with the phase and another with the wave-vector
orientation. We also show how to stabilize a single defect in a realistic
experimental situation. The effects of phase mismatch of nonlinear interaction
are finally considered.

physical implementation of the transformation $\varrho^{\otimes n} \to
\varrho^{n}$ in quantum mechanics is proved. For sake of further analysis the
simplest notion of structural completely positive approximation (SCPA) and
structural physical approximations (SPA) of unphysical map are introduced. Both
always exist for linear hermitian maps and can be optimised under natural
assumptions. However it is shown that some intuitively natural SPA of the
nonlinear operation $\varrho^{\otimes 2} \to \varrho^{2}$ that was already
proven to be unphysical is impossible. It is conjectured that there exist no
SPA of the operation $\varrho^{\otimes n} \to \varrho^{n}$ at all. It is
pointed out that, on the other hand, it is physically possible to measure the
trace of the second power of the state $Tr(\varrho^{2})$ if only two copies of
the system are available. This gives the interpretation of one of Tsallis
entropy as mean value of some ``multicopy'' observable. The (partial)
generalisation of this idea shows that each of higher order Tsallis entropies
can be measured with help of only two multicopy observables. Following this
observations the notion of multicopy entanglement witnesses is defined and
first example is provided. Finally, with help of multicopy observables simple
method of spectrum state estimation is pointed out and discussed.
