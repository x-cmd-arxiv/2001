time-independent N-body realisations of smooth time-independent density
distributions corresponding to both integrable and nonintegrable potentials,
allowing for N as large as 300,000. The principal focus is on distinguishing
between, and quantifying, the effects of graininess on initial conditions
corresponding, in the continuum limit, to regular and chaotic orbits. Ordinary
Lyapunov exponents X do not provide a useful diagnostic for distinguishing
between regular and chaotic behaviour. Frozen-N orbits corresponding in the
continuum limit to both regular and chaotic characteristics have large positive
X even though, for large N, the `regular' frozen-N orbits closely resemble
regular characteristics in the smooth potential. Viewed macroscopically both
`regular' and `chaotic' frozen-N orbits diverge as a power law in time from
smooth orbits with the same initial condition. There is, however, an important
difference between `regular' and `chaotic' frozen-N orbits: For regular orbits,
the time scale associated with this divergence t_G ~ N^{1/2}t_D, with t_D a
characteristic dynamical time; for chaotic orbits t_G ~ (ln N) t_D. At least
for N>1000 or so, clear distinctions exist between phase mixing of initially
localised orbit ensembles which, in the continuum limit, exhibit regular versus
chaotic behaviour. For both regular and chaotic ensembles, finite-N effects are
well mimicked, both qualitatively and quantitatively, by energy-conserving
white noise with amplitude ~ 1/N. This suggests strongly that earlier
investigations of the effects of low amplitude noise on phase space transport
in smooth potentials are directly relevant to real physical systems.

obtain high completeness requires acceptance of a very high false-positive

the completeness. Both completeness and efficiency are dependent upon the
filter used in the search and the desired mass threshold, emphasizing that a
measurement of the 3D mass function from gravitational lensing is affected by a

unusually large 54+/-16 km/s half-power full width. The centroid velocity of
the emission increased to 4319.6+/-0.6 km/s (38+/-2 km/s width) over the 13

unusual activity in the nucleus of IRASF01063-8034. Since the galaxy appears to

this correctly in neutron star systems as these have expected seed photon

also reflected continuum emission which must accompany the observed iron line,

reanalysis of the GINGA spectra of Cyg X-2 at all points along its Z track, and
show that the spectrum can be well fit by models in which the low energy

(DMS) is characterized by the interaction of large collective spins known as
bound magnetic polarons. Experimental measurements of the susceptibility of
these materials have suggested that the polaron-polaron interaction is
ferromagnetic, in contrast to the antiferromagnetic carrier-carrier
interactions that are characteristic of nonmagnetic semiconductors. To explain
this behavior, a model has been developed in which polarons interact via both
the standard direct carrier-carrier exchange interaction (due to virtual
carrier hopping) and an indirect carrier-ion-carrier exchange interaction (due
to the interactions of polarons with magnetic ions in an interstitial region).
Using a variational procedure, the optimal values of the model parameters were
determined as a function of temperature. At temperatures of interest, the
parameters describing polaron-polaron interactions were found to be nearly
temperature-independent. For reasonable values of these constant parameters, we
find that indirect ferromagnetic interactions can dominate the direct
antiferromagnetic interactions and cause the polarons to align. This result
supports the experimental evidence for ferromagnetism in insulating doped DMS.

from financial return series contain such a high amount of noise that, apart
from a few large eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors, their
structure can essentially be regarded as random. In [1], e.g., it is reported
that about 94% of the spectrum of these matrices can be fitted by that of a
random matrix drawn from an appropriately chosen ensemble. In view of the
fundamental role of covariance matrices in the theory of portfolio optimization
as well as in industry-wide risk management practices, we analyze the possible
implications of this effect. Simulation experiments with matrices having a
structure such as described in [1,2] lead us to the conclusion that in the
context of the classical portfolio problem (minimizing the portfolio variance
under linear constraints) noise has relatively little effect. To leading order
the solutions are determined by the stable, large eigenvalues, and the
displacement of the solution (measured in variance) due to noise is rather
small: depending on the size of the portfolio and on the length of the time
series, it is of the order of 5 to 15%. The picture is completely different,
however, if we attempt to minimize the variance under non-linear constraints,
like those that arise e.g. in the problem of margin accounts or in
international capital adequacy regulation. In these problems the presence of
noise leads to a serious instability and a high degree of degeneracy of the
solutions.

basic variables some combination of first derivatives of the spatial metric and
components of the extrinsic curvature tensor. Hyperbolic schemes, specifically
variations on schemes proposed by Bona and Masso and Anderson and York, are
compared with variations of the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formulation.
Modifications of the three basic schemes include raising one index in the
metric derivative and extrinsic curvature variables and adding a multiple of
the energy constraint to the extrinsic curvature evolution equations. Redundant
variables in the Bona-Masso formulation may be reset frequently or allowed to
evolve freely. Gauge conditions which simplify the dynamical structure of the
system are imposed during each time step, but the lapse and shift are reset
periodically to control the evolution of the spacetime slicing and the
longitudinal part of the metric. We show that physically correct boundary
conditions, satisfying the energy and momentum constraint equations,
generically require the presence of some ingoing eigenmodes of the
characteristic matrix. Numerical methods are developed for the hyperbolic
systems based on decomposing flux differences into linear combinations of
eigenvectors of the characteristic matrix. These methods are shown to be
second-order accurate, and in practice second-order convergent, for smooth

Hamilton operator for a point particle in curved space is naturally resolved by
using the powerful geometric calculus based on Clifford Algebra. The momentum
operator is defined to be the vector derivative (the gradient) multiplied by
$-i$; it can be expanded in terms of basis vectors $\gamma_\mu$ as $p = -i
\gamma^\mu \p_\mu$. The product of two such operators is unambiguous, and such
is the Hamiltonian which is just the D'Alambert operator in curved space; the
curvature scalar term is not present in the Hamiltonian if we confine our
consideration to scalar wave functions only. It is also shown that $p$ is
Hermitian and self-adjoint operator: the presence of the basis vectors
$\gamma^\mu$ compensates the presence of $\sqrt{|g|}$ in the matrix elements
and in the scalar product. The expectation value of such operator follows the
classical geodetic line.

using Goldstino angles to parametrise the supersymmetry breaking. It is well
known that twisted moduli enter at tree-level into the gauge kinetic functions,
and can provide new sources of gaugino mass if they develop F-term vacuum
expectation values. It is generally assumed that string states which are
sequestered from the twisted moduli receive a zero soft mass in the twisted
modulus domination limit, however the standard form of Kahler potential does
not reproduce this expectation. We therefore propose a new form of the Kahler
potential which is consistent at leading order with the sequestered form
proposed by Randall and Sundrum, and show that it leads to exponentially
suppressed sequestered soft masses. Including the effects of Green-Schwarz
mixing, we write down the soft scalar masses and trilinears arising from a type
I string construction involving intersecting D5_i and D9-branes in the presence
of untwisted and twisted moduli. If the squarks and sleptons are identified
with sequestered states then in the twisted moduli dominated limit this
corresponds to gaugino mediated supersymmetry breaking, and we discuss two
different scenarios for this. The general results will be useful for
phenomenological studies involving a combination of gravity and gaugino
mediated SUSY breaking due to the dilaton, untwisted and twisted moduli
contributions, and enable the soft masses to be studied as a function of the
different compactification radii.

relativistic systems by evolving in light-front time tau = t+z/c. The spectrum
and wavefunctions of bound states, such as hadrons in quantum chromodynamics,
can be obtained from matrix diagonalization of the light-front Hamiltonian on a
finite dimensional light-front Fock basis defined using periodic boundary
conditions in the light-front space coordinates. This method, discretized
light-cone quantization (DLCQ), preserves the frame-independence of the front
form even at finite resolution and particle number. Light-front quantization
can also be used in the Hamiltonian form to construct an event generator for
high energy physics reactions at the amplitude level. The light-front partition
function, summed over exponentially-weighted light-front energies, has simple
boost properties which may be useful for studies in heavy ion collisions. I
also review recent work which shows that the structure functions measured in
deep inelastic lepton scattering are affected by final-state rescattering, thus
modifying their connection to light-front probability distributions. In
particular, the shadowing of nuclear structure functions is due to destructive
interference effects from leading-twist diffraction of the virtual photon,

filtration of von Neumann subalgebras of $\M$ then for any non-commutative
martingale $x=(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ in $L^1(\M)$, adapted to

detail. We perform the Painlev\'e test and analyse the possibility of deriving
the B\""acklund transformation from the singularity analysis of the complex
Sine-Gordon equation. We make use of the analysis using the known relations for
the Painlev\'{e} equations to construct explicit formulae in terms of the
Umemura polynomials which are $\tau$-functions for rational solutions of the
third Painlev\'{e} equation. New classes of multivortex solutions of a
Weierstrass system are obtained through the use of this proposed procedure.
  Some physical applications are mentioned in the area of the vortex Higgs
model when the complex Sine-Gordon equation is reduced to coupled Riccati

Eliashberg theory for usual superconductors. We obtained that the averaged
contribution of the quasiparticle-phonon mechanism to the observed value of the
pairing gap for $^{120}$Sn is 26% and the BCS-type mechanism gives 74% . Thus,
pairing is of a mixed nature at least in semi-magic nuclei -- it is due to the
quasiparticle-phonon and BCS mechanisms, the first one being mainly a surface
mechanism and the second one mainly a volume mechanism. The calculations of the
strength distribution for the odd-mass nuclei $^{119}Sn$ and $^{121}Sn$ have
shown that the quasiparticle-phonon mechanism mainly improves the description
of the observed spectroscopic factors in these nuclei.
  For the case of nuclei with pairing in both proton and neutron systems it is
necessary to go beyond the Eliashberg-Migdal approximations and include the
vertex correction graphs in addition to the rainbow ones. The estimations for
spectroscopic factors performed within a three-level model have shown that the
contribution of the vertex correction graphs was rather noticeable.

technique bears a resemblance to classical optical coherence tomography (OCT).
However, it makes use of a nonclassical entangled twin-photon light source that
permits measurements to be made at depths greater than those accessible via
OCT, which suffers from the deleterious effects of sample dispersion. Aside
from the dispersion cancellation, QOCT offers higher sensitivity than OCT as
well as an enhancement of resolution by a factor of 2 for the same source
bandwidth. QOCT and OCT are compared using an idealized sample.
