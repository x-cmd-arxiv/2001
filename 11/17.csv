with the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) toward the sdOB star Feige
110 [(l,b) = (74.09, -59.07); d = 179 +265 -67 pc; z = -154 +57 -227 pc]. Our
determination of the DI column density made use of curve of growth fitting and
profile fitting analyses, while our OI column density determination used only
curve of growth techniques. The HI column density was estimated by fitting the
damping wings of the interstellar Ly alpha profile. We find log N(DI) = 15.47
+/- 0.06, log N(OI) = 16.73 +/- 0.10, and log N(HI) = 20.14 +0.13 -0.20 (all
errors 2 sigma). This implies D/H = (2.14 +/- 0.82) x 10^-5, D/O = (5.50 +1.64
-1.33) x 10^-2, and O/H = (3.89 +/- 1.67) x 10^-4. Taken with the FUSE results
reported in companion papers (Moos et al. 2001) and previous measurements of
the local interstellar medium, this suggests the possibility of spatial
variability in D/H for sight lines exceeding ~100 pc. This result may constrain
models which characterize the mixing time and length scales of material in the

well and based on its strength we estimate E(B-V)=0.58+/-0.12. Hence we
deredden our spectra and follow the evolution of the spectral energy
distribution on the decline from outburst. We find that the UV and optical
data, and the X-ray thermal component when detectable, can be fit with a simple
blackbody model of an accretion disc heated by internal viscosity and X-ray
irradiation, and extending to close to the last stable orbit around the black
hole, although the actual inner radius cannot be well constrained. During the
decline we see the disc apparently evolving from a model with the edge
dominated by irradiative heating towards one where viscous heating is dominant
everywhere. The outer disc radius also appears to decrease during the decline;
we interpret this as evidence of a cooling wave moving inwards and discuss its
implications for the disc instability model. Based on the normalisation of our
spectral fits we estimate a likely distance range of 4.6-8.0kpc, although a
value outside of this range cannot securely be ruled out.

cluster Terzan 1. This cluster is known to contain the bright neutron star
low-mass X-ray binary X 1732-304 which was active during the 1980's and most of
the 1990's. But a BeppoSAX observation performed in 1999 only showed a very
weak source indicating that the source had become quiescent. During our Chandra
observation, we detect one source with a 0.5-10 keV luminosity of approximately
1 - 2 x 10^{33} erg/s (for an assumed distance of 5.2 kpc). However, its
position is not consistent with that of X 1732-304. We do not conclusively
detect X 1732-304 with a 0.5-10 keV luminosity upper limit of 0.5 - 1 x 10^{33}
erg/s. This limit is consistent with the luminosities observed for several
neutron-star X-ray transients in our Galaxy when they are quiescent, strongly
suggesting that X 1732-304 was still quiescent during our Chandra observation.
If the quiescent emission in neutron star X-ray transients is due to the
thermal emission from the neutron star, then it is expected that the quiescent
luminosity depends on the time-averaged accretion rate of the source. However,
the upper limit on the quiescent luminosity of X 1732-304, combined with its
very long accretion episode prior to the current quiescent episode, indicates
that the quiescent episodes of the source have to be longer than ~200 years.
This would be the second system after KS 1731-260 for which quiescent episodes
longer than several hundreds of years have been inferred. We discuss this
possibility and alternative quiescent models to explain our results.

surface brightness diffuse component extending continuously from within at
least 60 pc of the active nucleus into the NE radio lobe 4 kpc from the
nucleus, along with 31 discrete compact knots, most of which are extended at
the resolution of our observation. We find that there are small but significant
differences between the X-ray and radio morphologies of the inner jet at the
arcsecond level, making it unlikely that a single, spatially coincident
population of ultrarelativistic electrons is responsible for the emission in
both energy regimes. We suggest that the X-ray knots of the inner jet are
indeed the sites of particle acceleration and shocks, and the X-ray and radio
knot offsets are caused by a combination of particle diffusion and energy loss.
These offsets may be a common feature of all jets in radio galaxies, or at
least jets in FR I type galaxies, and may be fundamental to the physics of such
jets. The X-ray spectra of several regions of the jet are well fit by absorbed
power-law models with photon indices $\sim$2.2-2.5, although the spectrum of

Such erupting fireballs produce a very bright gamma-ray precursor as they

complexity in the wavelength dependence of our limb profiles, which are

a combination of isothermal (two-dimensional) pressure and a flat rotation
curve. The dragging of inertial frames restricts possible solutions to rotation
speeds that are always less than 0.438 times the speed of light, a result first
obtained by Lynden-Bell and Pineault in 1978 for a cold disk. We show that
prograde circular orbits of massive test particles exist and are stable for all
of our model disks, but retrograde circular orbits cannot be maintained with
particle velocities less than the speed of light once the disk develops an
ergoregion. We also compute photon trajectories, planar and non-planar, in the
resulting spacetime, for disks with and without ergoregions. We find that all
photon orbits, except for a set of measure zero, tend to be focused by the
gravity of the flattened mass-energy distribution toward the plane of the disk.
This result suggests that strongly relativistic, rapidly rotating, compact
objects may have difficulty ejecting collimated beams of matter or light along
the rotation axes until the flows get well beyond the flattened parts of the
relativistic mass distribution (which cannot happen in the self-similar models
considered in this paper).

experimentally by stretching of single protein molecules. Using a mean-field
replica theory, we determine phase diagrams for stress-induced unfolding of
typical random sequences. This transition is sharp in the limit of infinitely
long chain molecules. But for chain lengths relevant to biological
macromolecules, partially unfolded conformations prevail over an intermediate
range of stress. These necklace-like structures, comprised of alternating
compact and extended subunits, are stabilized by quenched variations in the
composition of finite chain segments. The most stable arrangements of these
subunits are largely determined by preferential extension of segments rich in
solvophilic monomers. This predicted significance of necklace structures
explains recent observations in protein stretching experiments. We examine the
statistical features of select sequences that give rise to mechanical strength
and may thus have guided the evolution of proteins that carry out mechanical
functions in living cells.

  In this article, we propose a trace model for constraint solving by

pretend to be the ultimate one. We also propose an instrumented

by the analogy between the quantum vacuum and the ground state of quantum
liquid, in which the event horizon for the low-energy fermionic quasiparticles
also can arise. The quantum vacuum is characterized by the Fermi surface, which
appears behind the event horizon. We do not consider the back reaction, and
thus there is no guarantee that the stable black hole exists. But if it does
exist, the Fermi surface behind the horizon would be the necessary attribute of
its vacuum state. We also consider exact discrete spectrum of fermions inside

on-shell momentum condition emerges correctly. We also show that a naive
computation of the D25-brane tension using data for the three point coupling of
this state gives an answer that is $(\pi^2/3)(16/27\ln 2)^3 \simeq 2.0558$
times the expected answer. We demonstrate that this problem arises because the
HK state does not satisfy the equations of motion in a strong sense required
for the computation of D-brane tension from the on-shell 3-tachyon coupling.

flow; in others, $c_{eff}$ remains constant and the decreasing quantity is a
closed string analog, $g_{cl}$, of the ``boundary entropy'' of D-branes. We
discuss the non-supersymmetric orbifolds $C/Z_n$ and $C^2/Z_n$. In the first
case tachyon condensation decreases $n$ and in some cases connects type II and
type 0 vacua. In the second case non-singular orbifolds are related by tachyon
condensation to both singular and non-singular ones. We verify that $g_{cl}$
decreases in flows between non-singular orbifolds. The main tools in the
analysis are the structure of the chiral ring of the perturbed theory, the
geometry of the resolved orbifold singularities, and the throat description of
singular conformal field theories.
