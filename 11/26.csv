candidates. In addition, 4 galaxies reveal a characteristic U-warp. Compared to
statistical studies of local warps, and taking into account the strong bias
against observing the outer parts of galaxies at high redshift, these numbers
point towards a very high frequency of warps at z \sim 1: almost all galaxy
discs might be warped. Furthermore, the amplitude of warps are stronger than
for local warps. This is easily interpreted in terms of higher galaxy
interactions and matter accretion in the past. This result supports these two
mechanisms as the best candidates for the origin of early warps. The mean
observed axis ratio of our sample of edge-on galaxies is significantly larger
in the high-z sample than is found for samples of local spiral galaxies. This
might be due to disk thickening due to more frequent galaxy interactions.

broadband X-ray detection of this object that is free of contamination from
nearby sources in the field. We find that the nuclear X-ray emission is
unresolved in the Chandra image and confirm the rapid, large-amplitude X-ray
variability reported in previous studies. The spectrum of the nuclear source
shows evidence for absorption by an ionized medium. There is also evidence for
spectral variability over the course of the Chandra observation, although
contrary to prior reports, it appears to be uncorrelated with fluctuations in
the hard X-ray count rate. It is possible that the short-term spectral
variability results from column density changes in the ionized absorber. By far
the most unusual high-energy property of NGC 4395 is the shape of its spectrum
above 1 keV. The Chandra data indicate a power-law photon index of Gamma
\approx 0.6, which is much flatter than the Gamma \approx 1.8 X-ray spectra
typical of active galactic nuclei and the slope of the nuclear X-ray spectrum
measured from an earlier ASCA observation of NGC 4395. This extreme flatness
and dramatic long-term variability of the X-ray spectrum are unprecedented
among active galactic nuclei. A variety of possibilities for the origin of the
flat continuum slope are considered; none provides a fully satisfactory
explanation.

which competes with a higher than usual propagation speed of the particles.
Various measures for the effective propagation speed are analyzed: the group
and phase velocity in the high energy tail, the thermal average of the group
and phase velocity, and the speed of sound. Of these three groups, only the
first provides a possible solution to the cosmological horizon problem.

  From two large five-fold terraces on the surface in a short decorated
Fibonacci sequence, atomically resolved surface images have been obtained. One
of these terraces carries a rare local configuration in a form of a ring.
  The location of the corresponding sequence of terminations in the bulk model
M of icosahedral i-AlPdMn based on the three-dimensional tiling T*(2F) of an
F-phase has been estimated using this ring configuration and the requirement
from the LEED work of Gierer et al. that the average atomic density of the
terminations is 0.136 atoms per A^2.
  A termination contains two atomic plane layers separated by a vertical
distance of 0.48 A. The position of the bulk terminations is fixed within the
layers of Bergman polytopes in the model M: they are 4.08 A in the direction of
the bulk from a surface of the most dense Bergman layers.
  From the coding windows of the top planes in terminations in M we conclude
that a Penrose (P1) tiling is possible on almost all five-fold terraces. The
shortest edge of the tiling P1, is either 4.8 A or 7.8 A.
  The experimentally derived tiling of the surface with the ring configuration
has an edge-length of 8.0 +- 0.3 A and hence matches the minimal edge-length
expected from the model.

the usual minimal standard model matter content is followed by an examination
of right handed neutrinos in extended theories. I introduce the terminology of
``fully sterile'' and ``weakly sterile'' to classify varieties usually
conflated under the sterile neutrino banner. After introducing the concepts of
``technical naturalness'' and plain ``naturalness'', the unbearable lightness
of being a sterile neutrino is confronted. This problem is used to motivate
mirror neutrinos, whose connection with pairwise maximal mixing is emphasised.
Some brief remarks about phenomenology are made throughout. The impossibility
of identifying the sole sterile neutrino of the currently favoured $2 + 2$ and
$3 + 1$ phenomenological constructs as a lone gauge singlet fermion added to
the minimal standard model is explained. Finally, I remark on the beauty and
subtlety of light sterile neutrino cosmology.

The vertex operator of the scalar sigma is distinguished from that of the

the current quark mass and V_{0} is a vertex operator that would describe a
tachyon in the open bosonic string theory. This leads to a relation between the
sigma propagator and the pion propagator, when chiral symmetry is spontaneously
broken this relation implies that the propagator constructed from V_{0} must
behave like a massless ghost state. The presence of this state ensures that the
sigma is massive and no longer degenerate with the pion. The expectation value
of V_{0} in a string description is related to the vacuum expectation value of
the chiral condensate in QCD. Our analysis emphasizes the need for boundary

show that, for any symmetric space S of non-compact type without Euclidean de

arithmetic manifold, locally isometric to S, is homotopically equivalent to a
simplicial complex whose vertices degrees are bounded by d, and its number of

such a result holds also for compact arithmetic manifolds.
  We conclude that, for any fixed universal covering, S, other then the
hyperbolic plane, there are at most V^(CV) irreducible non-compact arithmetic

higher rank irreducible locally symmetric manifolds of finite volume are always

Rieman Zeta reduces to an orthogonality condition for the eigenfunctions of a

eigenvalues. The construction of $D^+$ is inspired by the conviction that
Riemann Zeta is associated with a physical system allowing conformal
transformations as its symmetries. The eigenfunctions of $D^+$ are analogous to
the so called coherent states and in general not orthogonal to each other. The
states orthogonal to a vacuum state (which has a negative norm squared)
correspond to the zeros of the Riemann Zeta. The induced metric in the space
${\cal{V}}$ of states which correspond to the zeros of the Riemann Zeta at the
critical line $Re[s]=1/2$ is hermitian and both hermiticity and positive
definiteness properties imply Riemann hypothesis. Conformal invariance in the
sense of gauge invariance allows only the states belonging to ${\cal{V}}$.
Riemann hypothesis follows also from a restricted form of a dynamical conformal
invariance in ${\cal{V}}$ and one can reduce the proof to a standard analytic
argument used in Lie group theory.

waveforms from BPM's were adjusted with delay cables avoiding overlaps and they
enabled simultaneous measurement of beam positions of two bunches.
  The beam energies of two bunches were balanced by tuning rf pulse timings,
and the average energy was stabilized by adjusting the accelerating rf phases.
The average beam orbits were also stabilized. Slow feedback systems at the
injector section for charge and bunching stabilities are being planned as well.
These systems were used successfully in the test beams and will be employed in

incidence into a plane parallel layer of a medium with a refractive index
smaller than the index of the surrounding medium, and also confined (Gaussian)
beams, still at oblique incidence. In the present paper the case of a Bessel

the outer Petschek solution and the inner diffusion region solution. Here the
details of the numerical simulation of the diffusion region are presented and
the asymptotic procedure which is used for deriving the reconnection rate is
described. The reconnection rate is obtained as a decreasing function of the
diffusion region length. For a sufficiently large diffusion region scale, the
reconnection rate becomes close to that obtained in the Sweet-Parker solution
with the inverse square root dependence on the magnetic Reynolds number,
determined for the global size of the current sheet. On the other hand, for a
small diffusion region length scale, the reconnection rate turns out to be very
similar to that obtained in the Petschek model with a logarithmic dependence on
the magnetic Reynolds number. This means that the Petschek regime seems to be
possible only in the case of a strongly localized conductivity corresponding to
a small scale of the diffusion region.
