wind from the starbursting bulge has pre-enriched a vast region around it, with
these metals being able to enrich to $\sim 1/10$ solar of order of $5\times

similar to that of the Sagittarius dwarf, from stars spread across 110 square
degrees of sky. Focusing on stars with the colors of F turnoff objects, we
identify at least five additional overdensities of stars. Four of these may be

this new structure could be a new dwarf satellite of the Milky Way, hidden in
the Galactic plane, and in the process of being tidally disrupted. The other
possibility is that it could be part of a disk-like distribution of stars which
is metal-poor, with a scale height of approximately 2 kpc and a scale length of
approximately 10 kpc. The fifth overdensity, which is 20 kpc away, is some
distance from the Sagittarius dwarf streamer orbit and is not associated with
any known structure in the Galactic plane. It is likely that there are many
smaller streams of stars in the Galactic halo.

al. (1997). We compare the present-day luminosity functions, colours,
morphology and spatial distribution of our simulated galaxies with those of the
real local population, in particular with the Updated Zwicky Catalog, with the
IRAS PSCz redshift survey, and with individual local clusters such as Coma,
Virgo and Perseus. We also use the simulations to study the clustering bias
between the dark matter and galaxies of differing type. Although some
significant discrepancies remain, our simulations recover the observed
intrinsic properties and the observed spatial distribution of local galaxies
reasonably well. They can thus be used to calibrate methods which use the
observed local galaxy population to estimate the cosmic density parameter or to
draw conclusions about the mechanisms of galaxy formation. To facilitate such

temperature, about 1 keV. We show that these steep thermal (and density)
gradients follow naturally from the usual cooling inflow assumptions without
recourse to thermal conductivity. To avoid unobserved central mass
concentrations, most of the gas must radiatively cool (``dropout'') before it
flows to the galactic core, i.e. the gas must be multiphase. Recent XMM spectra
of M87 indicate single phase flow at every radius with no apparent radiative
cooling to low temperatures. However, the X-ray spectral evidence for
multiphase cooling beginning at lower temperatures near 1 keV (within about 10
kpc) may be less apparent and may have escaped detection. Finally, we show that
the standard decomposition method used by X-ray observers to determine the mass
flow dM/dt(r) may fail rather badly due to small deviations from perfectly
steady state flow. When applied to our slightly non-steady computed flows, this
decomposition (incorrectly) gives the usual result, dM/dt proportional to r,

higher energy photons are very well correlated with radio images. Our data also
provide marginal evidence for radial expansion of the X-ray remnant at a rate

are expected to be produced copiously at center-of-mass energies above the
fundamental Planck scale. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) may thus turn into a
factory of black holes, at which their production and evaporation may be
studied in detail. But even before the LHC starts operating, the Pierre Auger
Observatory for cosmic rays, presently under construction, has an opportunity
to search for black hole signatures. Black hole production in the scattering of
ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos on nucleons in the atmosphere may initiate
quasi-horizontal air showers far above the Standard Model rate. In this letter,
we compare the sensitivity of LHC and Auger to black hole production by
studying their respective reach in black hole production parameter space.
Moreover, we present constraints in this parameter space from the
non-observation of horizontal showers by the Fly's Eye collaboration. We find
that if the ultrahigh energy neutrino flux is at the level expected from cosmic
ray interactions with the cosmic microwave background radiation, Auger has only
a small window of opportunity to detect black holes before the start of the
LHC. If, on the other hand, larger ultrahigh energy neutrino fluxes on the
level of the upper limit from ``hidden'' hadronic astrophysical sources are
realized in nature, then the first signs of black hole production may be
observed at Auger. Moreover, in this case, the Fly's Eye constraints, although
more model dependent, turn out to be competitive with other currently available
constraints on TeV-scale gravity which are mainly based on interactions
associated with Kaluza-Klein gravitons.

string-theoretic orbifold and orientifold models. In a class of realistic
models, consistency conditions require branes and antibranes to be stuck at
different fixed points, and so their mutual attraction generates a potential
for one of the radii of the underlying torus or the 4D string dilaton. Assuming
that all other moduli have been fixed by string effects, we find that this
potential leads naturally to a period of cosmic inflation with the radion or
dilaton field as the inflaton. The slow-roll conditions are satisfied more
generically than if the branes were free to move within the space. The
appearance of tachyon fields at certain points in moduli space indicates the
onset of phase transitions to different non-BPS brane systems, providing ways
of ending inflation and reheating the corresponding observable brane universe.
In each case we find relations between the inflationary parameters and the
string scale to get the correct spectrum of density perturbations. In some
examples the small numbers required as inputs are no smaller than 0.01, and are
the same small quantities which are required to explain the gauge hierarchy.

evaluation, and the most effective one turns out to be the split gauge defined
by S_{\delta}(q_1,q_2)=0. This results in expressions involving bilinear
theta-constants M. The final formula in terms of only theta-constants follows
from new identities between M and theta-constants which may be interesting in
their own right. The action of the modular group Sp(4,Z) is worked out

which insures the modular invariance of the full chiral superstring measure,
and hence a unique way of implementing the GSO projection for even spin
structure. The resulting cosmological constant vanishes, not by a Riemann
identity, but rather by the genus 2 identity expressing any modular form of

interesting physical consequences of these solutions. First, a certain subclass
of the solutions discussed in this paper have an exponential warp factor
similar to that of the Randall-Sundrum model. However, the warp factor depends
on more than just the 5$^{th}$ coordinate. In addition the warp factor arises
from anisotropic vacuum solution rather than from any explicit matter. Second,
the solitonic character of these solutions might allow them to be interpreted
either as gravitational models for particles (i.e. analogous to the ' t
Hooft-Polyakov monopole, but in the context of gravity), or as nonlinear,
anisotropic gravitational waves.

represented by a cylinder and cocylinder functors. The existence of 'pastings'

with homotopy constructs which will be developed in a sequel. Here, the

  We calculate the neutron angular and energy distributions by using first
order perturbation theory for the Coulomb amplitude and an eikonal approach for
the nuclear breakup. This allows for a simple physical interpretation of the
results which are mostly analytical. Our formalism includes the effect of the
nuclear distortion of the neutron wave function on the Coulomb amplitude. This
leads to a Coulomb-nuclear coupling term derived here for the first time which
gives a small contribution for light targets but is of the same order of
magnitude as nuclear breakup for heavy targets. The overall interference is
constructive for light to medium targets and destructive for heavy targets.
Thus it appears that Coulomb breakup experiments need to be analyzed with more
accurate models than those used so far.

properties in relativistic Hartree approximation using a Lagrangian whose
QCD-scaled coupling constants are all natural (dimensionless and of order 1).
Our model consists of four-, six-, and eight-fermion point couplings (contact
interactions) together with derivative terms representing, respectively, two-,
three-, and four-body forces and the finite ranges of the corresponding mesonic
interactions. The coupling constants have been determined in a self-consistent
procedure that solves the model equations for representative nuclei
simultaneously in a generalized nonlinear least-squares adjustment algorithm.
The extracted coupling constants allow us to predict ground state properties of
a much larger set of even-even nuclei to good accuracy. The fact that the
extracted coupling constants are all natural leads to the conclusion that QCD
scaling and chiral symmetry apply to finite nuclei.

F has recently been evaluated for the special case of metals (refractive index
n=\infty), here analogous results are presented for dielectrics, and shown
graphically when n=2.0. Our calculational method relies upon quantum
statistical mechanics. The Debye expansions for the Riccati-Bessel functions
when carried out to a high order are found to be very useful in practice
(thereby overflow/underflow problems are easily avoided), and also to give
accurate results even for the lowest values of l. Another virtue of the Debye
expansions is that the limiting case of metals becomes quite amenable to an
analytical treatment in spherical geometry. We first discuss the zero-frequency
TE mode problem from a mathematical viewpoint and then, as physical input,
invoke the actual dispersion relations. The result of our analysis, based upon
adoption of the Drude dispersion relation as the most correct one at low
frequencies, is that the zero-frequency TE mode does not contribute for a
metal. Accordingly, F turns out in this case to be only one half of the
