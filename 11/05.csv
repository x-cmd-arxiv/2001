their mass assembly histories, using a statistical sample of halos in a
high-resolution N-body simulation of the LCDM cosmology. For each halo at z=0,
we identify its merger-history tree, and determine concentration parameters
c_vir for all progenitors, thus providing a structural merger tree for each
halo. We fit the mass accretion histories by a universal function with one
parameter, the formation epoch a_c, defined when the log mass accretion rate
dlog M/doga falls below a critical value. We find that late forming galaxies
tend to be less concentrated, such that c_vir ``observed'' at any epoch a_obs
is strongly correlated with a_c via c_vir=c_1 a_obs/a_c. Scatter about this
relation is mostly due to measurement errors in c_vir and a_c, implying that
the actual spread in c_vir for halos of a given mass can be mostly attributed
to scatter in a_c. Because of the direct connection between halo concentration
and velocity rotation curves, and because of probable connections between halo
mass assembly history and star formation history, the tight correlation between
these properties provides an essential new ingredient for galaxy formation
modeling.

extrapolation to primordial values. The confrontation of SBBN results with 7Li
observations is of special interest since other independent approaches have
also recently provided Omega_B.h^2 values: i) the anisotropies of the Cosmic

the Lyman-alpha forest at high redshift. Comparison between these results
obtained by different methods provides a test of their consistency and could
provide a better determination of the baryonic density in the universe.

existence of a very tight linear relationship between the V-band ``zero

have empirically calibrated this relationship using local single B-stars with
accurate angular diameters, and B-stars in eclipsing binaries with precise
radii and parallax determinations. By studying the differential behaviour of
this relationship as predicted by theoretical stellar evolution models, we find
that it is independent of the stellar metallicities for a range of [Fe/H]
values between the solar one and that of young stars in the Magellanic Clouds.
The method, which also provides the value of the reddening to the system, is
discussed in detail, together with a thorough estimate of the associated

more concentrated than either the subgiant branch or the main sequence stars,

  Workshop, The Earliest Phases of Massive Star Birth, 6.-8. Aug. 2001",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The connection between high-mass stars and young stellar clusters has been
well established by near-IR observations showing young massive stars in HII
regions surrounded by clusters of lower mass stars. Mm-wave observations show
that these clusters form in approx. 1000 Msol dense cores. Interestingly, the
mm-wave observations of very active cluster-forming regions also reveal the
presence of seemingly quiescent dense massive cores, which contain few signs of
ongoing star formation. In the W3 Main region we find an approx. 1000 Msol mass
dense core which contains no mid-IR or cm-continuum sources. Near-IR imaging
has failed to detect any embedded sources. Yet, we suggest that this region is
at an early stage of cluster formation. This is given support by comparative
observations of the NGC 6334 GMC. Here, we find another quiescent massive 1000
Msol core without mid-IR sources, HII regions, or a detectable near-IR cluster.
Motivated by the presence of CH3OH and H2O masers in this IR-quiet core, we
have searched for and detected a bipolar outflow driven by a young massive star
deeply embedded in the core. The presence of an embedded high-mass star
strengthens our arguments that IR-quiet cores are at an early stage of cluster
formation. We propose that masers and outflows from very deeply embedded (and
consequently IR-quiet) high-mass stars are among the first incipient signposts
of cluster formation in massive cores. Accordingly, we have undertaken a SEST
survey of 46 CH3OH maser clusters which are not coincident with IRAS sources or
HII regions. From this sample, we detected outflows in transitions of SiO
toward 15 of the maser clusters. These sources have now been observed at 1200
micron with SIMBA, the 37-multichannel bolometer at SEST. Each one is
associated with a bright 1 mm point source.

local and non-local high-energy corrections to general relativity in 4D, which
are identical to those predicted by brane-world models. Secondly, we notice
that in brane models the usual matter in 4D is a consequence of the dependence
of five-dimensional metrics on the extra coordinate. If the 5D bulk metric is
independent of the extra dimension, then the brane is void of matter. Thus, in
brane theory matter and geometry are unified, which is exactly the paradigm
proposed in STM. Consequently, these two 5D theories share the same concepts
and predict the same physics. This is important not only from a theoretical
point of view, but also in practice. We propose to use a combination of both
methods to alleviate the difficult task of finding solutions on the brane. We

specifies the energy scale. At 30 GeV, we find r = 1.422 +/- 0.051, r(1) =
1.761 +/- 0.071 and r(2) = 1.98 +/- 0.13, where the uncertainties are the
statistical and systematic terms added in quadrature. These results are in
general agreement with theoretical predictions. In addition, we use the
measurements of the energy dependence of Ng and Nq to determine an effective
value of the ratio of QCD color factors, CA/CF. Our result, CA/CF = 2.23 +/-
0.14 (total), is consistent with the QCD value of 2.25.

coefficient matrix defining the three-string interactions. However, they can
give non-vanishing values because of the breakdown of the degeneracy at the
edge of the eigenvalue distribution. We also present a general prescription of
correctly simplifying the expressions of these observables. Numerical

machine. In this paper, we introduce the simulator of the global orbit feedback
system as an example. This simulates the global orbit feedback system under the
constraint conditions for Pohang Light Source (PLS) storage ring. We describe
the details of the feedback algorithm and the realization of the simulator.

hot and dense hadronic matter is reviewed. Critical fluctuations near the
critical point of QCD matter are predicted to enhance fluctuations in pionic
observables. Chemical fluctuations, especially those of locally conserved
quantum numbers, such as electric charge and baryon number, can probe the
nature of the carriers of these quantum numbers in the dense medium.

propagation of an electromagnetic (em) wave along the static background
magnetic field in a two-component plasma has been investigated using the Block
equation. The evolution process induces a strong magnetic anisotropy in the
plasma medium, depending nonlinearly on the incident wave amplitude. This
induced magnetic anisotropy can modify the dispersion relation of the incident
em wave, which has been obtained in this paper. In the low frequency Alfven
wave limit, this dispersion relation shows that the resulting phase velocity of
the incident wave depends on the square of the incident wave amplitude and on
the static background magnetic field of plasma. The analytical results are in
well agreement with the numerically estimated values in solar corona and
sunspots.

for Radioactive Ion Beam (RIB) originated by fission fragments produced by

performance and cost and will allow to produce also intense neutron beams for
activities both in fundamental and applied Nuclear Physics [1]. In the context
of this design study and tightly related to medium size of this facility the
architecture of a distributed control system using the Common Object Request
Broker Architecture (CORBA) [2] as middleware framework and JAVA [3] as main
programming language was investigated for the core sub-systems (diagnostics,
optics, RF-control) of the primary accelerator. The performance of CORBA for
the high level control system was measured in different conditions and showed
to be sufficient to cover the requirements for remote operations, because all
feedback loops will be performed either in specialized hardware or by dedicated
real-time embedded controllers. A minimal programming effort, a good level of
modularity and long-term maintenance were the reasons to choose JAVA and its
related application builders as the main programming language for the Graphical
User Interface (GUI) and the middleware implementations of this project.

dielectric function is well adapted to the Lifshitz formula and leads to
reasonable results for real conductors. The Drude dielectric function which
describes media with dissipation is found not to belong to the application
range of the Lifshitz formula at nonzero temperature. For Drude metals the
special modification of the zero-frequency term of this formula is suggested.
The contradictory results on the subject in recent literature are analysed and

prove useful to those pursuing the many proposed applications of down-converted
light.
