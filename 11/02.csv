holes can be triaxial in shape. Schwarzschild's method was first used to
construct self-consistent orbital superpositions representing nuclei with axis
ratios of 1:0.79:0.5 and containing a central point mass representing a black
hole. Two different density laws were considered, with power-law slopes of -1
and -2. We constructed two solutions for each power law: one containing only
regular orbits and the other containing both regular and chaotic orbits.
Monte-Carlo realizations of the models were then advanced in time using an
N-body code to verify their stability. All four models were found to retain
their triaxial shapes for many crossing times. The possibility that galactic
nuclei may be triaxial complicates the interpretation of stellar-kinematical
data from the centers of galaxies and may alter the inferred interaction rates
between stars and supermassive black holes.

Sub-millimeter observations of the early afterglows are of interest because
this is where the emission peaks in some bursts in the days to weeks following
the burst. Of increasing interest is to look for underlying quiescent
sub-millimeter sources that may be dusty star-forming host galaxies. In this
paper, we present observations of GRB 991208, 991216, 000301C, 000630, 000911,

with coming from the afterglow. This means that we did not conclusively detect
quiescent sub-millimeter counterparts to any of the bursts that were studied
from 1997 through 2000. The inferred star formation rates (M > 5 Msun) are
typically < 300 Msun/yr. If GRBs are due to the explosions of high-mass stars,
this may indicate that the relatively small population of extremely luminous
dusty galaxies does not dominate the total star formation in the universe at
early epochs. Instead, the GRBs may be predominantly tracing slightly lower
luminosity galaxies. The optical faintness of some host galaxies is unlikely to
be explained as due to dust absorption in the host.

to chaos induced in the orbit families which populate the model. At larger

show that centrophilic orbits there resist stochasticity over many dynamical

to radio wavelengths and should be observable to very high redshift. Indeed,
our ongoing near-IR followup programs already have the potential to detect
bursts at redshift z ~ 10. In these proceedings, we discuss two distinct ways
of using GRBs to probe the earliest star formation. First, direct GRB counts
may be used as a proxy for star formation rate measurements. Second, high
energy cutoffs in the GeV spectra of gamma ray bursts due to pair production
with high redshift optical and ultraviolet background photons contain

integrated star formation history prior to the GRB redshift.

causes row-dependent gain, event grade `morphing' (spatial redistribution of
charge) and energy resolution degradation.
  The ACIS back-illuminated (BI) CCDs also exhibit pronounced CTI due to their
manufacturing. It is mild enough that position-dependent energy resolution is
not seen, but it is present in both parallel and serial registers. This CTI
also changes the gain and event grades, in a spatially complicated way as
parallel and serial CTI interact.
  Given these realities, we have developed and tuned a phenomenological model
of CTI for both FI and BI CCDs and incorporated it into our Monte Carlo
simulations of the ACIS CCDs. It models charge loss and the spatial
redistribution of charge (trailing), thus reproducing the spatially-dependent
gain and grade distribution seen in all ACIS CCDs and the row-dependent energy
resolution seen in the FI devices. Here we explore the evidence for CTI,
compare our simulations to data, and present a technique for CTI correction

investigation of the Local Interstellar Medium (LISM) towards the general

for an enhanced level of scattering which is over and above what can be
accounted for by the enhanced scattering model for the Local Bubble. These
results are interpreted in terms of enhanced scattering due to turbulent plasma
associated with the Loop I shell. Useful constraints are obtained for the
scattering properties of the shell. The inferred value for the scattering
measure for the Loop I shell is found to be ~0.3 pc m^{-20/3}. Assuming a shell
thickness ~5-10 pc, this implies an average strength of scattering in the shell
that is ~100-200 times larger than that in the ambient ISM. An alternative
explanation, where the enhanced level of scattering is due to a possible

considered; it is found to be somewhat less satisfactory in explaining the

component. We explain this difference in the component widths by using the
nested cone emission geometry.
  We estimate the effect of pulsar spin on the Stokes parameters, and find that
the inclination between the rotation and magnetic axes can introduce an
asymmetry in the circular polarization of the conal components. We analyze the
single pulse polarization data of PSR B0329+54 at 606 MHz, and find that in its
conal components, one sense of circular polarization dominates in the leading
component while the other sense dominates in the trailing component. Our

sense of circular polarization as well as the swing of polarization angle.

elementary black holes - daemons - making up the dark matter (DM) of the
Galactic disk, which, as follows from our measurements, were trapped by the
Earth during 4.5 Gyr in an amount of ~10^24. Due to their huge mass
(~2x10^(-8)kg), these particles settle down to the Earth's center to form a
kernel. Assuming the excess flux of 10-20 TW over the heat flux level produced
by known sources, which is quoted by many researchers, to be due to the energy
liberated in the outer kernel layers in daemon-stimulated proton decay of iron
nuclei, we have come to the conclusion that the Earth's kernel is presently
measured in few fractions of meter in size. The observed mantle flux of 3He
(and the limiting 3He/4He ~ 10^(-4) ratio itself) can be provided if at least
one 3He(or 3T) nucleus is emitted in a daemon-stimulated decay of ~100-1000 Fe
nuclei. This could remove actually the only objection to the hot origin of the
Earth and to its original melting. The high energy liberation at the center of
the Earth drives two-phase two-dimensional convection in its inner core (IC),
with rolls oriented along the rotation axis. This provides an explanation for
the numerous features in the IC structure revealed in the recent years. The
energy release in the kernel grows continuously as the number of daemons in it
increases. Therefore the global tectonic activity, which had died out after the
initial differentiation and cooling off of the Earth was reanimated ~2 Gyr ago
by the rearrangement and enhancement of convection in the mantle as a result of
the increasing outward energy flow. It is pointed out that as the kernel
continues to grow, the tectonic activity will become intensified rather than
die out, as this was believed before.

matter at all. Theoretical models for ellipticities in weak lensing studies
often rely on an assumed correlation of the angular momentum vectors of dark
matter and gas in galaxies. Both of these assumptions are shown to be in
reasonable agreement with high resolution cosmological smoothed particle
hydrodynamical simulations that follow the dark matter as long as only
adiabatic gas physics are included. However, we argue that in more realistic
models of galaxy formation one expects pressure forces to play a significant
role at turn--around. Consequently the torquing force on DM and baryons will be
uncorrelated and their respective angular momenta are not expected to align. An

transitions in La{2-x}Sr{x}CuO{4+delta} is investigated. The ambient and high
pressure properties of two series of samples with x=0 and x=0.015 and
0<delta<0.1 are characterized and compared by ac-susceptibility measurements.
At ambient pressure both sets of samples fit into the same phase diagram as a
function of the total hole concentration, n_h. For n_h<0.085 there is a single
superconducting transition (T_{c} approx 30 K) with an unusually large pressure
coefficient, dT_c{30}/dp approx 10K/GPa. At higher hole density (n_h>0.085) a
second superconducting transition (T_{c} approx 15 K) follows the first
transition upon cooling and the pressure shift of this transition is negative,
dT_c{15}/dp approx -4 K/GPa. At the boundary as the hole density is close to
0.085 the phase separation can be induced by pressure. The results are
explained in terms of a strong correlation of the interstitial oxygen with the
hole system in the CuO-planes. Pressure, applied at ambient temperature, causes
a redistribution of holes. The mobile oxygen dopants follow and enhance T_c as
well as the tendency to phase separation. If pressure is changed at low
temperature (<100 K) the effects on T_c and phase separations are greatly
diminished because the interstitial oxygen becomes immobile at low T. Our
results indicate that the dopant effects are important. Dopants and holes
should be treated as a single globally correlated state. When thermodynamic
euqilibrium is achieved in the soft-doping samples, we find that there is an
intrinsic tendency of electronic phase separation of doped holes into two
distinct superconducting states.

between the array and the cavity mode. From extensive numerical solutions of
the model in one dimension, we find that the array locks into a coherent,
periodic state above a critical number of active junctions, that the
current-voltage characteristics of the array have self-induced resonant steps
(SIRS's), that when $N_a$ active junctions are synchronized on a SIRS, the
energy emitted into the resonant cavity is quadratic in $N_a$, and that when a
fixed number of junctions is biased on a SIRS, the energy is linear in the
input power. All these results are in agreement with recent experiments. By
choosing the initial conditions carefully, we can drive the array into any of a
variety of different integer SIRS's. We tentatively identify terms in the
equations of motion which give rise to both the SIRS's and the coherence
threshold. We also find higher-order integer SIRS's and fractional SIRS's in

a ring- or a tunnel like motion, with the participation of several neighboring
atoms. In the glassy state, hopping is found to be accompanied by larger
fluctuations in the total energy and the volume of the system. Both
orientational and translational hopping are found to be {\it gated}, restricted
primarily by the entropic bottlenecks, with orientation becoming increasingly
slower than translation as the pressure is increased. OR is heterogeneous, with
a wide distribution of decay times.

investigate new phenomena in colloidal systems on approach to their glass
transitions. When the inter-particle potential contains an attractive part,
besides the usual repulsive hard core, two intersecting liquid-glass transition
lines appear, one of which extends to low densities, while the other one, at
high densities, shows a re-entrant behaviour. In the glassy region a new type
of transition appears between two different types of glasses. The complex
phenomenology can be described in terms of higher order glass transition
singularities. The various glass phases are characterised by means of their
viscoelastic properties. The glass driven by attractions has been associated to
particle gels, and the other glass is the well known repulsive colloidal glass.
These correspondences, in associations with the new predictions of glassy
behaviour mean that such phenomena may be expected in colloidal systems with,
for example, strong depletion or other short-ranged attractive potentials.

oscillatory neural networks modeling cortical areas such as hippocampus and
olfactory cortex. Recent experiments have shown that synaptic plasticity
depends on spike timing, especially on synapses from excitatory pyramidal
cells, in hippocampus and in sensory and cerebellar cortex. Here we study how
such plasticity can be used to form memories and input representations when the
neural dynamics are oscillatory, as is common in the brain (particularly in the
hippocampus and olfactory cortex). Learning is assumed to occur in a phase of
neural plasticity, in which the network is clamped to external teaching
signals. By suitable manipulation of the nonlinearity of the neurons or of the
oscillation frequencies during learning, the model can be made, in a retrieval
phase, either to categorize new inputs or to map them, in a continuous fashion,
onto the space spanned by the imprinted patterns. We identify the first of
these possibilities with the function of olfactory cortex and the second with
the observed response characteristics of place cells in hippocampus. We
investigate both kinds of networks analytically and by computer simulations,
and we link the models with experimental findings, exploring, in particular,
how the spike timing dependence of the synaptic plasticity constrains the
computational function of the network and vice versa.

which is generated over the polynomials or trigonometric functions by some set,
necessarily has the same closure as the module which is generated by this same
set, but now over the compactly supported smooth functions. The particular
properties of the ambient space or generating set are to a large degree
irrelevant. This translation -- which goes in fact beyond modules -- allows us,
by what is now essentially a straightforward check of a few properties, to
replace many classical results by more general and stronger statements of a
hitherto unknown type. As a side result, we also obtain a new integral
criterion for multidimensional measures to be determinate. At the technical
level, we use quasi-analytic classes in several variables and we show that two
well-known families of one-dimensional weights are essentially equal. The
method can be formulated for Lie groups and this interpretation shows that many
classical approximation theorems are ""actually"" theorems on the unitary dual of
n-dimensional real space. Polynomials then correspond to the universal

immersed in a two-dimensional fluid flow are known to lead to particle
accumulation in the regions of the flow in which rotation dominates over shear,
provided that the Stokes number of the particles is sufficiently small. If the
flow is viewed as a Hamiltonian dynamical system, it can be seen that the
accumulations occur in the nonchaotic parts of the phase space: the
Kolmogorov--Arnold--Moser tori. This has suggested a generalization of these
dynamics to Hamiltonian maps, dubbed a bailout embedding. In this paper we use
a bailout embedding of the standard map to mimic the dynamics of impurities
subject not only to drag but also to fluctuating forces modelled as white
noise. We find that the generation of inhomogeneities associated with the
separation of particle from fluid trajectories is enhanced by the presence of
noise, so that they appear in much broader ranges of the Stokes number than
those allowing spontaneous separation.

  Entropy Methods, B. Fry (Ed.), AIP Proceedings. 11pages, 3 Postscript figures",,"10.1063/1.1477037",,"physics.data-an",,"  In this paper, we first consider the parameter estimation of a multivariate
random process distribution using multivariate Gaussian mixture law. The labels
of the mixture are allowed to have a general probability law which gives the
possibility to modelize a temporal structure of the process under study. We
generalize the case of univariate Gaussian mixture in [Ridolfi99] to show that
the likelihood is unbounded and goes to infinity when one of the covariance
matrices approaches the boundary of singularity of the non negative definite
matrices set. We characterize the parameter set of these singularities. As a
solution to this degeneracy problem, we show that the penalization of the
likelihood by an Inverse Wishart prior on covariance matrices results to a
penalized or maximum a posteriori criterion which is bounded. Then, the
existence of positive definite matrices optimizing this criterion can be
guaranteed. We also show that with a modified EM procedure or with a Bayesian
sampling scheme, we can constrain covariance matrices to belong to a particular
subclass of covariance matrices. Finally, we study degeneracies in the source
separation problem where the characterization of parameter singularity set is
more complex. We show, however, that Inverse Wishart prior on covariance
matrices eliminates the degeneracies in this case too.

quantum computation leads to new complexity but retains the old computability.

A 65, 043803 (2002)","10.1103/PhysRevA.65.043803",,"quant-ph",,"  We analyze the problem of quantum-limited estimation of a stochastically
varying phase of a continuous beam (rather than a pulse) of the electromagnetic
field. We consider both non-adaptive and adaptive measurements, and both dyne
detection (using a local oscillator) and interferometric detection. We take the
phase variation to be \dot\phi = \sqrt{\kappa}\xi(t), where \xi(t) is
\delta-correlated Gaussian noise. For a beam of power P, the important
dimensionless parameter is N=P/\hbar\omega\kappa, the number of photons per
coherence time. For the case of dyne detection, both continuous-wave (cw)
coherent beams and cw (broadband) squeezed beams are considered. For a coherent
beam a simple feedback scheme gives good results, with a phase variance \simeq
N^{-1/2}/2. This is \sqrt{2} times smaller than that achievable by nonadaptive
(heterodyne) detection. For a squeezed beam a more accurate feedback scheme
gives a variance scaling as N^{-2/3}, compared to N^{-1/2} for heterodyne
detection. For the case of interferometry only a coherent input into one port
is considered. The locally optimal feedback scheme is identified, and it is
shown to give a variance scaling as N^{-1/2}. It offers a significant
improvement over nonadaptive interferometry only for N of order unity.
