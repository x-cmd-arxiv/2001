high-resolution NIR images and optical low-resolution spectra. IRAS 03158+4227
is confirmed as a component of an equal-luminosity binary galaxy with a nuclei
separation of 47 / (h/75) kpc. A long lopsided tail emanating from the
companion, which harbours an active nucleus, is the most prominent peculiar
feature of the binary. The results of numerical simulations admit the
interpretation of this structure as a product of the tidal interaction between
the two components. If the infrared-activity of IRAS 03158+4227 is also
dynamically triggered by this process, this would implicate that the ULIRG
phenomenon is not restricted to the final stage of a binary merger.
Alternatively, the system may be a multiple merger where the partner(s)
has/have already coalesced.

galaxies selected by luminosity, and the LF bi-variate in central brightness.
The Coma cluster and control fields were imaged using the CFH12K (42x28 arcmin)
and UH8K (28x28 arcmin) wide-field cameras at the CFHT. Selected HST images
were used for testing. Quantities were derived from measurements in at least
two colors, which have the following features: (1) Galaxies as faint as three
times the luminosity of the brightest globular clusters are in the completeness
region of our data. (2) We have a complete census (in the explored region) of
low surface brightness galaxies with central surface brightness galaxies almost
as low as the faintest so far cataloged ones. (3) The explored area is among
the largest ever sampled with CCDs at comparable depth for any cluster of
galaxies. (4) The error budget includes all sources of errors known to date.
Using HST images we also discovered that blends of globular clusters, not
resolved in individual components due to seeing, look like dwarf galaxies when
observed from the ground and are numerous and bright. The derived Coma LF is
relatively steep (alpha=-1.4) over the 11 magnitudes sampled, but the slope and
shape depend on color. A large population of faint low surface brightness
galaxies was discovered, representing the largest contributor (in number) to
the LF at faint magnitudes. We found a clear progression for a faintening of
the LF from high surface brightness galaxies (mu~20 mag/arcsec2) to galaxies of
very faint central brightnesses (mu~24.5 mag/arcsec2), and some evidence for a
steepening. Compact galaxies, usually classified as stars and therefore not
included in the LF, are found to be a minor population in Coma.

numerical simulations using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code CRASH

distribution (GDD) and an inhomogeneous, fractal one (FDD) has been made with
realistic assumptions for the ionising stellar sources based on available data
in the solar neighborhood. In both cases the escape fraction f_esc increases
with ionisation rate N_gamma (although for the FDD with a flatter slope) and
they become equal at N_gamma = 2*10^50 s^-1 where f_esc = 0.11. FDD allows
escape fractions of the same order also at lower N_gamma, when Lyc photon
escape is sharply suppressed by GDD. Values of the escape fraction as high as
0.6 can be reached (GDD) for N_gamma ~ 9*10^50 s^-1, corresponding to a star
formation rate (SFR) of roughly 2 M_o yr^-1; at this ionising luminosity the
FDD is less transparent (f_esc ~ 0.28). If high redshift galaxies have gas
column densities similar to local ones, are characterized by such high SFRs and
by a predominantly smooth (i.e.turbulence free) interstellar medium, our
results suggest that they should considerably contribute to - and possibly

predominantly via collisional excitation followed by radiative decay. Such

matching resolved X-ray line profiles. We suggest that for strong lines of
abundant metals, newly created photons may undergo resonance scattering,
modifying the emergent profile. Using Sobolev theory in a spherically symmetric
wind, we show that thick-line resonance scattering leads to emission profiles
that still have blueshifted centroids like the thin lines, but which are
considerably less asymmetric in appearance. We focus on winds in the
constant-expansion domain, and derive an analytic form for the profile shape in

predicts more sodium absorption than we observe. There are several

range of right ascension (75 degree strips) but only within a narrow range of
declination (10 degree and 15 degree strips). This allows measurements of the
two-dimensional genus to be made.
  The NGP displays a slight meatball shift topology, whereas the SGP displays a
bubble like topology. The current SGP data also have a slightly higher genus
amplitude. In both cases, a slight excess of overdense regions are found over
underdense regions. We assess the significance of these features using mock

We find that differences between the NGP and SGP genus curves are only
significant at the 1 sigma level. The average genus curve of the 2dFGRS agrees
well with that extracted from the LCDM mock catalogs.
  We compare the amplitude of the 2dFGRS genus curve to the amplitude of a
Gaussian random field with the same power spectrum as the 2dFGRS and find,
contradictory to results for the 3D genus of other samples, that the amplitude
of the GRF genus curve is slightly lower than that of the 2dFGRS. This could be
due to a a feature in the current data set or the 2D genus may not be as

to provide a sensitive census of the level of obscured star formation in
galaxies at all redshifts. While in general there is good agreement between the
source counts from existing SCUBA (850um) and MAMBO (1.25mm) surveys of
different depths and areas, it remains difficult to determine the redshift
distribution and bolometric luminosities of the sub-millimetre and millimetre
galaxy population. This is principally due to the ambiguity in identifying an
individual sub-millimetre source with its optical, IR or radio counterpart
which, in turn, prevents a confident measurement of the spectroscopic redshift.
Additionally, the lack of data measuring the rest-frame FIR spectral peak of
the sub-millimetre galaxies gives rise to poor constraints on their rest-frame
FIR luminosities and star formation rates. In this paper we describe

is reviewed. Recent observational evidence from very-high energy (VHE, energies
above 100 GeV) gamma-ray measurements is in contradiction with the surmise that
synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons is indicative for hadron
acceleration. It rather points to a CR-acceleration efficiency of supernova
remnants (SNRs) below one percent, much less than the value required if these
objects were to be the main sources of Galactic cosmic rays (about 30%).
Observations of CR anisotropy and the emission of low-energy (energy < 10 GeV)
gamma-rays from the Galactic disk indicate that the sources of low-energy
cosmic rays are distributed with a Galactocentric radial scale length in the
order of 25 +- 10 kpc, much larger than expected if SNRs are the main sources
of CRs. These two facts - together with the body of evidence from CR isotope
abundances - strongly suggest that a new class of astrophysical objects -
distinct from SNRs and located manly in the outer reaches of our Galaxy - is
the major source of hadronic CRs in our Galaxy. The basic observational
features of ultra high-energy (UHE, energy > 10^{19} eV) CRs are most naturally
understood if the same CR sources accelerate CRs up to the highest observed CR
energies. Proposals for the nature of a new source class are mentioned. The
origin of CRs is still as much shrouded in mystery as it was in 1957, when
Philip Morrison wrote a seminal review about CR origin. The potential for

bi-layer susceptibility and separate the intrinsic properties due to the
geometric frustration from those related to the site dilution. Our major
findings are: 1) The intrinsic kagome bi-layer susceptibility exhibits a
maximum in temperature at 40-50 K and is robust to a dilution as high as ~20%.
The maximum reveals the development of short range antiferromagnetic
correlations; 2) At low-T, a highly dynamical state induces a strong wipe-out
of the NMR intensity, regardless of dilution; 3) The low-T upturn observed in
the macroscopic susceptibility is associated to paramagnetic defects which stem
from the dilution of the kagome bi-layer. The low-T analysis of the NMR
lineshape suggests that the defect can be associated with a staggered
spin-response to the vacancies on the kagome bi-layer. This, altogether with
the maximum in the kagome bi-layer susceptibility, is very similar to what is
observed in most low-dimensional antiferromagnetic correlated systems; 4) The
spin glass-like freezing observed at T_g=2-4 K is not driven by the
dilution-induced defects.

eigenstates (SES) in energy space reveals an excellent agreement with the
quantum one. This correspondence allows us to understand important features of
the SES in terms of classical trajectories. We also show that for typical 2D
modulated waveguides there exist, at any energy range, extremely localized
eigenstates (in energy) which are practically unperturbed by the modulation.
These states contribute to the strong fluctuations around the classical SES.
The approach to the classical limit is discussed.

analyse several particle and nuclear collisions and extract their chemical
freeze-out temperature $T$ at zero baryochemical potential ($\mu_B$). We find
at $\mu_B=0$ a universal rise and saturation of both the $T$ and of the
strangeness suppression factor $\lambda_s$ (=$\frac {2\bar{s}} {\bar{u} +
\bar{d}} $) with increasing initial energy density ($\epsilon_i$). The onset of
saturation of both $T$ and $\lambda_s$, is interpreted as due to the event of
the QCD phase transition. The critical energy density is estimated to be
$\epsilon_c$ $\sim$ 1 +0.3 -0.5 GeV/fm$^3$, corresponding approximately to a
$\sqrt{s}$ of $\sim$ 8.8 GeV for central Pb+Pb collisions. Concerning the role
of strangeness, we identify trivial and non-trivial sources of strangeness
enhancement: The peak of $\lambda_s$ in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=8.8 GeV
and other phenomena of 'strangeness enhancement' defined with respect to p+p
data, are trivially traced back to the different baryochemical potentials and
$\epsilon_i$ of the compared systems. A non trivial redefined '$\lambda_s$

estimated to be approximately reached in Au+Au collisions at the LHC.

solutions are shown to depend mainly on the transport opacity, $\chi=\int dz
\sigma_t\rho_g$. The elliptic flow saturation pattern reported by STAR
indicates that $\chi_{b=0} \sim 25$, i.e., the gluon plasma is $\sim 80$ times
more opaque than the pQCD estimate based on HIJING. Such large opacities are
also consistent with the measured charged hadron spectra.

Starting from the quantum theory, one investigates such objects as
semiclassical states and observables, semiclassical inner product,
semiclassical gauge transformations and evolution. Quantum mechanical
semiclassical substitutions (not only the WKB-ansatz) can be viewed as
""composed semiclassical states"" being infinite superpositions of wave packets
with minimal uncertainties of coordinates and momenta (""elementary
semiclassical states""). Each elementary semiclassical state is specified by a
set (X,f) of classical variables X (phase, coordinates, momenta) and quantum
function f (""shape of the wave packet"" or ""quantum state in the background X"").
A notion of an elemantary semiclassical state can be generalized to the
constrained systems, provided that one uses the refined algebraic quantization
approach based on modifying the inner product rather than on imposing the
constrained conditions on physical states. The inner product of physical states
is evaluated. It is obtained that classical part of X the semiclassical state
should belong to the constrained surface; otherwise, the semiclassical state
(X,f) will have zero norm for all f. Even under classical constraint
conditions, the semiclassical inner product is degenerate. One should factorize
then the space of semiclassical states. Semiclassical gauge transformations and
evolution of semiclassical states are studied. The correspondence with

d_Q, as a divergence. Since merely local terms lead to gauge destroying
expressions, one has to focus on them exclusively. In the first part of the
work the local gauge-factor group will be defined in the style of the concept
of gauge cohomology theory. It will be shown, that every element out of the so
defined factor group under the transformation d_Q leads to a divergence of the
entire operator valued distribution d_Q(T_n). In the second part all local
terms arising in causal Yang-Mills theory are systematically investigated.
Without further restrictions there can be proven, that every local operator

relevance are that a wire medium exhibits a frequency region in which the real
part of permittivity is negative, and SRRs produce a frequency region in which
the real part of permeability is negative. In the combination structure, at
frequencies where both the recovered real part of permittivity and permeability
are simultaneously negative, the real part of the index-of-refraction is found
also to be unambigously negative.

quantum teleportation with continuous variables and for generating
