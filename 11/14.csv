  The Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/338382",,"astro-ph",,"  We present the star formation history of UGCA 290, a galaxy with properties
intermediate between Blue Compact Dwarfs and Dwarf Irregulars. This galaxy is
particularly interesting because its young stellar population is extremely
similar to that of the well-studied type iE Blue Compact Dwarf VII Zw 403,
despite its different spatial morphology and old stellar content. Our Hubble
Space Telescope/Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 single-star photometry for UGCA
290 extends over nine magnitudes in I, and allows a detailed study of its star
formation history. Using synthetic color-magnitude diagrams, we show that the
recent ""burst"" which gives this galaxy its BCD status is a moderate enhancement
in star formation which lasted for approximately 20 Myr, at a rate about ten
times above its previous rate. The star formation history for most of the
previous billion years is consistent with a constant rate, although
enhancements as large as the current one are possible at times ealier than 400
Myr ago. We estimate that the total mass converted into stars in UGCA 290 more
than one billion years ago is about three times the astrated mass since that
time. The initial mass function is consistent with a Salpeter slope, and the
stellar metallicity is bracketed by Z_sun/50 and Z_sun/5, with evidence for
metallicity evolution. Similar results for the star formation history over the
past 600 Myr apply to VII Zw 403. Our main result is that despite the
traditional picture of BCDs, the current bursts in these two galaxies are
neither remarkably intense nor short-lived, and that most of their star
formation occured more than a billion years ago.

e-folding time of ~0.9 Gyr. A compatible scenario is presented for this
evolution in which the quasar dims due to the absence of low velocity
interactions between the quasar host and companion galaxies which trigger
quasar activity and/or a diminishing fuel supply caused by the more effective

well described by black-body radiation with peak temperature of 2.4 keV. The
total energy release from the event is 10^{42} erg (for an assumed distance of

therefore large energy release (factor of 1500-4000 longer and 250-425 more
energy than normal type I X-ray bursts from this source). The flare is preceded
by a short and weak X-ray burst, possibly of type I. Days to weeks before the
flare, type I X-ray bursts were seen at a rate of ~3 per day. However, after
the flare type I X-ray bursting ceased for at least a month, suggesting that
the superburst affected the type I bursting behaviour. The persistent emission
is not significantly different during the non-bursting period. We compare the

relatives of tidally excited waves. This interpretation suffers from a number
of problems. For example, the natural site of wave excitation lies outside the
Roche lobe, the disc must be especially hot, and most treatments of wave
propagation do not take into account the vertical structure of the disc.
  In this paper I construct a detailed semi-analytical model of the non-linear
tidal distortion of a thin, three-dimensional accretion disc by a binary
companion on a circular orbit. The analysis presented here allows for vertical
motion and radiative energy transport, and introduces a simple model for the
turbulent magnetic stress. The m=2 inner vertical resonance has an important
influence on the amplitude and phase of the tidal distortion. I show that the
observed patterns find a natural explanation if the emission is associated with
the tidally thickened sectors of the outer disc, which may be irradiated from
the centre. According to this hypothesis, it may be possible to constrain the

central ionizing star of a planetary nebula (PN) might become magnetically
active and thereby display strong X-ray luminosity. Since most PNe are older
than few billion years, any main sequence companion will rotate too slowly to
have magnetic activity and hence bright X-ray emission, unless it is spun-up.
We demonstrate that if the orbital separation during the AGB phase of the PN
progenitor is less than 30-60 AU, main sequence companions in the spectral type
range F7 to M4 will accrete enough angular momentum from the AGB wind to rotate
rapidly, become magnetically active, and exhibit strong X-ray luminosities.
Lower mass M stars and brown dwarfs can also become magnetically active, but
they should have small orbital separations and hence are less likely to survive
the AGB phase of the progenitor. We estimate that 20-30 per cent of elliptical
PNe and 30-50 per cent of bipolar PN are likely to have magnetically active
companions which will reveal themselves in X-ray observations. Re-analysis of
Chandra X-ray Observatory spectroscopy of the compact central source of NGC

anomalies similar to those of coronally active main-sequence stars.

(Harrison et al. 1999) on the accretion disc limit cycle model. Using the
observed long term light curve of SS Cyg and d=166 pc, we obtain for the mean
mass transfer rate 4.2*10^(17)g/s. In addition, we calculate the vertical
structure of the accretion disc taking into account heating of the outer disc
by the stream impact. Comparing the mean accretion rate derived from the
observations with the calculated critical mass transfer rate, we find that the
disc instability model disagrees with the observed long term light curve of SS
Cyg as the mean mass transfer rate is greater or similar to the critical mass
transfer rate. The failure of the model indicated by this result can be
confirmed by considering that the accretion rate at the onset of the decline
should be exactly equal to the value critical for stability. In contrast to
this prediction of the model, we find that the accretion rate required to
explain the observed visual magnitude at the onset of the decline must be
significantly higher than the critical mass transfer rate. Our results strongly
suggest that either the usually assumed temperature dependence of the viscosity
parameter alpha is not a realistic description of the disc viscosity, that the
mass transfer rate in SS Cyg noticeably increases during the outbursts or,
finally, that the HST distance of 166 pc, is too high.

gradient shell just above the photosphere. This gas may be identified with a
slow (v < 40 km/s) progenitor wind accelerated at the ejecta-wind interface. In
this scenario, the photosphere coincides with a cool dense shell formed in the
reverse shock. Acceleration by radiation from the supernova or by a
shock-accelerated relativistic particle precursor are both possible
explanations for the observed fast CS gas. An alternative, equally plausible
scenario is that the fast CS gas is accelerated within shocked clouds engulfed
by the outer shock, as it propagates through the intercloud wind.

future (e.g. with the Herschel Space Observatory) photometric surveys the
evolutionary status of YSOs. The advantage over other tools already developed
is that photometry at other wavelengths is not required: three flux
measurements are enough to derive the evolutionary status of a source. As an
example we use the colours of the YSO IRAS 18148$-$0440 to classify it as Class
I. The main limitation of this work is the low spatial resolution of the LWS

to the background emission or to the source confusion inside the LWS beam.

satisfaction. It is known that the notion of local consistency can be extended
to constraint optimisation problems defined by soft constraint frameworks based
on an idempotent cost combination operator. This excludes non idempotent
operators such as + which define problems which are very important in practical
applications such as Max-CSP, where the aim is to minimize the number of
violated constraints. In this paper, we show that using a weak additional axiom
satisfied by most existing soft constraints proposals, it is possible to define
a notion of soft arc consistency that extends the classical notion of arc
consistency and this even in the case of non idempotent cost combination
operators. A polynomial time algorithm for enforcing this soft arc consistency
exists and its space and time complexities are identical to that of enforcing
arc consistency in CSPs when the cost combination operator is strictly
monotonic (for example Max-CSP). A directional version of arc consistency is
potentially even stronger than the non-directional version, since it allows non
local propagation of penalties. We demonstrate the utility of directional arc
consistency by showing that it not only solves soft constraint problems on
trees, but that it also implies a form of local optimality, which we call arc
irreducibility.

or even proper conformal Killing vectors in the Newman-Penrose (NP) formalism.
Leaning on, and extending, results previously derived in the GHP formalism we
show that the (conformal) Killing equations can be replaced by a set of
equations involving the commutators of the Lie derivative with the four NP
differential operators applied to the four coordinates.
  It is crucial that these operators refer to a preferred tetrad relative to
the (conformal) Killing vectors, a notion to be defined. The equations can then
be readily solved for the Lie derivative of the coordinates, i.e. for the
components of the (conformal) Killing vectors. Some of these equations become
trivial if some coordinates are chosen intrinsically (where possible), i.e. if
they are somehow tied to the Riemann tensor and its covariant derivatives.
  If part of the tetrad, i.e. part of null directions and gauge, can be defined
intrinsically then that part is generally preferred relative to any Killing
vector. This is also true relative to a homothetic vector or a proper conformal
Killing vector provided we make a further restriction on that intrinsic part of
the tetrad. If because of null isotropy or gauge isotropy, where part of the
tetrad cannot even in principle be defined intrinsically, the tetrad is defined
only up to (usually) one null rotation parameter and/or a gauge factor, then
the NP-Lie equations become slightly more involved and must be solved for the
Lie derivative of the null rotation parameter and/or of the gauge factor as
well. However, the general method remains the same and is still much more
efficient than conventional methods.
  Several explicit examples are given to illustrate the method.

detector of a Minkowski scalar particle with defined transverse momentum per
unit of proper time of the source and we show that it corresponds to the
induced absorption or spontaneous and induced emission of Rindler photons from
the thermal bath. We then take what could be called the inert limit of the
DeWitt detector by considering the limit of zero gap energy. As suggested by
DeWitt, we identify in this limit the detector with a classical point source

Finally, we study the behavior of the emission rate in D space-time dimensions
in connection with the so called apparent statistics inversion.

interferometric gravitational-wave detectors (e.g. LIGO-III and EURO), one
strategy is to monitor the relative momentum or speed of the test-mass mirrors,
rather than monitoring their relative position. This paper describes and
analyzes the most straightforward design for a {\it speed meter interferometer}
that accomplishes this -- a design (due to Braginsky, Gorodetsky, Khalili and
Thorne) that is analogous to a microwave-cavity speed meter conceived by
Braginsky and Khalili. A mathematical mapping between the microwave speed meter
and the optical interferometric speed meter is developed and is used to show
(in accord with the speed being a Quantum Nondemolition [QND] observable) that
{\it in principle} the interferometric speed meter can beat the
gravitational-wave standard quantum limit (SQL) by an arbitrarily large amount,
over an arbitrarily wide range of frequencies, and can do so without the use of
squeezed vacuum or any auxiliary filter cavities at the interferometer's input
or output. However, {\it in practice}, to reach or beat the SQL, this specific
speed meter requires exorbitantly high input light power. The physical reason
for this is explored, along with other issues such as constraints on
performance due to optical dissipation. This analysis forms a foundation for
ongoing attempts to develop a more practical variant of an interferometric
speed meter and to combine the speed meter concept with other ideas to yield a
promising LIGO-III/EURO interferometer design that entails low laser power.

charged current ratio for SNO is predicted to be 3.5 +- 0.6 (1 sigma), which is
separated from the no-oscillation value of 1.0 by much more than the expected
experimental error. The predicted range of the day-night difference in charged
current rates is (8.2 +- 5.2)% and is strongly correlated with the day-night
effect for neutrino-electron scattering. A measurement by SNO of either a NC to
CC ratio > 3.3 or a day-night difference > 10%, would favor a small region of
the currently allowed LMA neutrino parameter space. The global oscillation
solutions predict a 7Be neutrino-electron scattering rate in BOREXINO and
KamLAND in the range 0.66 +- 0.04 of the BP00 standard solar model rate, a
prediction which can be used to test both the solar model and the neutrino
oscillation theory. Only the LOW solution predicts a large day-night effect(<

by the electromagnetic $U_A(1)$ anomaly under the assumption that $\pi^0$ is a

method suggested earlier which gives the differential cross section for each
reaction and the branching ratio for each decay mode in terms of an overall
normalization depending only on the speed at which the mass matrix rotates. A
rotation speed estimated earlier, under certain assumptions from the fermion
mixing angles and mass ratios, is found to give the above effects at a level
readily detectable in modern high sensitivity experiments such as Bepc, Cleo,
BaBar and Belle, at least in principle. The observation of these effects would
not only confirm the concept of a rotating mass matrix with a significance on
par with the running coupling constant, but also offer some valuable insight
into the origin of fermion generations. However, a negative result cannot
unfortunately rule out the rotating mass matrix since the effects deduced here
from this mechanism alone could in principle be cancelled by other rotation
effects.

consistent quantization in a positive definite Hilbert space. The effect of
constraints on the localizability of fields in the generalized space-time is
analyzed. Usual d-dimensional Minkowski space-time is identified with the
subspace of the matrix space $\M_M$ that allows true localization of the
dynamical fields. Minkowski coordinates are argued to be associated with some
Clifford algebra in the matrix space $\M_M$. The dynamics of a conformal scalar

usual conformal field dynamics of a scalar and spinor in the 3d Minkowski

excepted, these estimators are not linear and so depend on the scale of the
measurements. In this paper a weaker property than linearity is imposed on the
Bayesian estimator, namely the scale invariance property (SIP).First, we state
some results on linear estimation and then we introduce and justify a scale
invariance axiom. We show that arbitrary choice of scale measurement can be
avoided if the estimator has this SIP. Some examples of classical
regularization procedures are shown to be scale invariant. Then we investigate
general conditions on classes of Bayesian estimators which satisfy this SIP, as
well as their consequences on the cost function and prior laws. We also show
that classical methods for hyperparameters estimation (i.e., Maximum Likelihood
and Generalized Maximum Likelihood) can be introduced for hyperparameters
estimation, and we verify the SIP property for them. Finally we discuss how to
choose the prior laws to obtain scale invariant Bayesian estimators. For this,
we consider two cases of prior laws: {\em entropic prior laws} and {\em
first-order Markov models}. In related preceding works

remove the supposedly unconditional security. One example is the BB84 protocol,

  Backward [in Time] Dynamic One that Assigns Causes","22 pages; paper presented in double lecture at the fifth biannual
  international quantum structures association meeting, 2001",,,,"quant-ph math-ph math.LO math.MP",,"  In this paper we argue that the Sasaki adjunction, which formally encodes the
logicality that different authors tried to attach to the Sasaki hook as a
`quantum implicative connective', has a fundamental dynamic nature and encodes
the so-called `causal duality' (Coecke, Moore and Stubbe 2001;
quant-ph/0009100) for the particular case of a quantum measurement with a
projector as corresponding self-adjoint operator. In particular: The action of
the Sasaki hook $(a\stackrel{S}{\to}-)$ for fixed antecedent $a$ assigns to
some property ``the weakest cause before the measurement of actuality of that
property after the measurement'', i.e. ${(a\stackrel{S}{\to}b)}$ is the weakest
property that guarantees actuality of $b$ after performing the measurement
represented by the projector that has the `subspace $a$' as eigenstates for
eigenvalue 1, say, the measurement that `tests' $a$ . From this we conclude
that the logicality attributable to quantum systems contains a fundamentally
dynamic ingredient: Causal duality actually provides a new dynamic
interpretation of orthomodularity. We also reconsider the status of the Sasaki
hook within `dynamic (operational) quantum logic' (DOQL). We can derive two
labeled dynamic hooks (forwardly and backwardly) that encode how quantum
measurements act on properties. In an even more radical perspective one could
say that the transition from either classical or constructive/intuitionistic
logic to quantum logic entails besides the introduction of an additional unary
connective `operational resolution' (Coecke 2001a; math.LO/0011208) the shift
from a binary connective implication to a ternary connective where two of the
arguments refer to qualities of the system and the third, the new one, to an
obtained outcome (in a measurement).

  measurements","LaTeX, 12 pages, no figures. Math errors and typos corrected, some
  clarifications, added Acknowledgments",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We present a finite set of projective measurements that, together with
quantum memory and preparation of the |0> state, suffice for universal quantum
computation. This extends work of Nielsen [quant-ph/0108020], who proposed a
scheme in which an arbitrary unitary operation on n qubits can be simulated
using only projective measurements on at most 2n qubits. All measurements in
our set involve two qubits, except two measurements which involve three qubits.
Thus we improve by one the upper bound, implied by Nielsen's results, on the
maximum number of qubits needed to participate in any single measurement to
achieve universal quantum computation. Each of our measurements is two-valued,
and each can be expressed mathematically as a Boolean combination of
single-qubit measurements.

fields on a manifold to the controllability of the dynamical system is shown to
apply to Holonomic Quantum Computation. Conditions for deriving the holonomy
algebra are presented by taking covariant derivatives of the curvature
associated to a non-Abelian gauge connection. When applied to the Optical
Holonomic Computer, these conditions determine that the holonomy group of the
two-qubit interaction model contains $SU(2) \times SU(2)$. In particular, a
universal two-qubit logic gate is attainable for this model.

systems. If the permitted operations are restricted to the Ising interaction,
plus local rotations and spin measurements, high-fidelity teleportation is
achievable for quantum states that are close to the maximally weighted spin
state. ES is achieved, and is maximized for a combination of entangled states
and Bell measurements that is different from the QT case. If more general local
unitary transformations are considered, then it is possible to achieve perfect
teleportation and ES.
