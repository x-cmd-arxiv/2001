comparing surface photometry of its two nearest satellites, M32 and NGC 205,
with N-body simulations of satellite destruction. The recent discovery of a
giant stream in M31's outer halo, apparently pointed towards M32 and NGC 205,
makes such an investigation particularly relevant. The observational component
of this study is based on 1.7 x 5.0 degree B- and I- band CCD mosaic images
centered on M31 and covering both satellites. The simulation component of this
project is based on the analysis of single-component, spherical model
satellites that are tidally disrupted through interactions with their parent
galaxy. Generic features of the simulations include an excess in the surface
brightness profile at large radii, a depletion zone at intermediate radii, and
isophotal elongation and twists that are coincident with breaks in the
brightness profile. The satellites M32 and NGC 205 display most of these
features consistently across the B and I bands, strongly suggestive of tidal
interaction and probable stripping by M31. We discuss what these observed
features can tell us about the satellites' orbital parameters and histories.
Specifically, M32 is found to be on a highly eccentric orbit and away from
pericenter. Investigating M32's unusual combination of high surface brightness
and low luminosity (the hallmark of compact ellipticals), we conclude on
empirical grounds that M32 is not likely to be the residual core of a
tidally-stripped normal elliptical galaxy as has been suggested, but rather
that its precursor was intrinsically compact.

  changes made to the text, Figure 1 added",,"10.1086/341040",,"astro-ph",,"  Recent observations of surface brightness distributions of both Milky Way and
M31 satellite galaxies have revealed many instances of sudden changes or breaks
in the slope of the surface brightness profiles (at some break radius,
r_break). These breaks are often accompanied by increasingly elliptical
isophotes and sometimes by isophote twisting. We investigate the hypothesis of
a tidal origin for these features by applying the same ellipse fitting
techniques that are used on observed galaxies to numerical simulations of the
destruction of satellites, represented by spherical, single-component systems.
We examine how observed quantities such as r_break, ellipticity and position
angle of the fitted ellipses and amplitude of extra-break population vary with
the satellite's orbital eccentricity and phase, and our viewpoint relative to
the orbit. We also look at orbit and viewpoint dependence of the rate of change
of the latter three quantities with radius.
  We find that there are trends with orbital phase and eccentricity in all
observed quantities, many of which are preserved through a wide variety of
viewing angles. In particular, a generic feature of all simulations is a
depletion zone just interior to an excess zone, regions in which the surface
brightness is lower and higher, respectively, than the initial profile. A clear
interpretation of any individual image, however, is likely to be hampered by
the dependence of the observable features on these multiple parameters. For
example, breaks can be excited by several physical processes and can occur well
within the bound satellite population. Nevertheless, we do find we can place
loose constraints on the tidal radius, mass loss rate, orbital type and phase
of the satellite, and nature of breaks using photometric data alone.

Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory and its Applications, September 2001 in
Tehran, Iran.
  These notes cover only selected parts of the by now quite extensive knowledge
on logarithmic conformal field theories. In particular, I discuss the proper
generalization of null vectors towards the logarithmic case, and how these can
be used to compute correlation functions. My other main topic is modular
invariance, where I discuss the problem of the generalization of characters in
the case of indecomposable representations, a proposal for a Verlinde formula
for fusion rules and identities relating the partition functions of logarithmic
conformal field theories to such of well known ordinary conformal field
theories.
  These two main topics are complemented by some remarks on ghost systems, the
Haldane-Rezayi fractional quantum Hall state, and the relation of these two to
the logarithmic c=-2 theory.

concept of APS, Argonne [1]. However, for SLS the hardware was completely
redesigned while preserving the software compatibility with the APS system.
This gave us a head start in the implementation: we could use the latest
available hardware and take advantage of the features integrated in the EPICS
software. The event system is used as the sole timing distribution method, for
hardware trigger delivery (assisted with a high-precision delay at a few
places) and for controlling all the timing-related tasks of operation: injector
sequencing, filling patterns, software synchronization, timestamps and so on.
The event network is also extended to the beamlines to allow synchronization of
the beamline experiments. The implementation consists of the hardware (Gigabit
Ethernet link, FPGAs) and a firmware core written in VHDL. The functionality of
the cards can be modified in situ by rewriting the firmware in flash memory. On
the other hand, the functionality can be easily ported to new hardware
architectures, allowing smooth upgrade paths and maximal reusability of the
soft- and hardware resources.

accompanied in a certain region of space by antidumping of waves, and in
particular situations antidumping may prevail over damping. It is possible that
this effect may explain the experimental difficulties connected with inhibition
of instabilities of plasma in the problem of controllable thermonuclear fusion.

nanometers above complex dielectric structures reveals the intricate
light-matter interaction that occurs in this near-field zone. This information
can only be extracted from an analysis of the polarization state of the
detected light in the near-field. These polarization states can be calculated
by different numerical methods well-suited to near--field optics. In this
paper, we apply two different techniques (Localized Green Function Method and
Differential Theory of Gratings) to separate each polarisation component
associated with both electric and magnetic optical near-fields produced by
nanometer sized objects. The analysis is carried out in two stages: in the
first stage, we use a simple dipolar model to achieve insight into the physical
origin of the near-field polarization state. In the second stage, we calculate
accurate numerical field maps, simulating experimental near-field light
detection, to supplement the data produced by analytical models. We conclude
this study by demonstrating the role played by the near-field polarization in
the formation of the local density of states.

Wannier-Stark problem developed in recent years. This approach allows to
compute the complex energy spectrum of a Wannier-Stark system as the poles of a
rigorously constructed scattering matrix and solves the Wannier-Stark problem
without any approximation. The suggested method is very efficient from the
numerical point of view and has proven to be a powerful analytic tool for
Wannier-Stark resonances appearing in different physical systems such as
optical lattices or semiconductor superlattices.
