threaded by large-scale electrical currents, and the effect of resonant Compton
scattering by the charge carriers (both electrons and ions) on the emergent
X-ray spectra and pulse profiles. In the magnetar model for the SGRs and AXPs,
these currents are maintained by magnetic stresses acting deep inside the star.
We construct self-similar, force-free equilibria of the current-carrying
magnetosphere with a power-law dependence of magnetic field on radius, B ~
r^(-2-p), and show that a large-scale twist softens the radial dependence to p
< 1. The spindown torque acting on the star is thereby increased in comparison
with a vacuum dipole. We comment on the strength of the surface magnetic field
in the SGR and AXP sources, and the implications of this model for the narrow
measured distribution of spin periods. A magnetosphere with a strong twist,
B_\phi/B_\theta = O(1) at the equator, has an optical depth ~ 1 to resonant
cyclotron scattering, independent of frequency (radius), surface magnetic field
strength, or charge/mass ratio of the scattering charge. When electrons and
ions supply the current, the stellar surface is also heated by the impacting
charges at a rate comparable to the observed X-ray output of the SGR and AXP
sources, if B_{dipole} ~ 10^{14} G. Redistribution of the emerging X-ray flux
at the ion and electron cyclotron resonances will significantly modify the
emerging pulse profile and, through the Doppler effect, generate a non-thermal
tail to the X-ray spectrum. The sudden change in the pulse profile of SGR
1900+14 after the 27 August 1998 giant flare is related to an enhanced optical
depth to electron cyclotron scattering, resulting from a sudden twist imparted
to the external magnetic field.

analysis by demanding that the detected flux variations be achromatic and

J0910+5422 was selected as an X-ray cluster candidate in the ROSAT Deep Cluster
Survey on the basis of its spatial extent in a Rosat PSPC image. Deep optical
and near-IR imaging reveal a red galaxy overdensity around the peak of the
X-ray emission, with a significant excess of objects with J-K and I-K colors
typical of elliptical galaxies at z ~ 1.0. Spectroscopic observations at the
Keck II telescope secured 9 galaxy redshifts in the range 1.095<z<1.120
yielding a mean cluster redshift of <z>=1.106. Eight of these galaxies lie
within a 30 arcsec radius around the peak X-ray emission. A deep Chandra ACIS
exposure on this field shows extended X-ray morphology and allows the X-ray
spectrum of the intracluster medium to be measured. The cluster has a
bolometric luminosity L_x = 2.48^{+0.33}_{-0.26} x 10^44 ergs/s, a temperature
of kT = 7.2^{+2.2}_{-1.4} keV, and a mass within r = 1 Mpc of 7.0 x 10^14 M_sun

the cluster members is elongated, which is not due to an observational
selection effect, and followed by the X-ray morphology. The X-ray surface
brightness profile and the spectrophotometric properties of the cluster members
suggest that this is an example of a massive cluster in an advanced stage of
formation with a hot ICM and an old galaxy population already in place at z >

in a number of model populations, varying assumptions about which physical
parameters determine structural quantities and star formation histories. We
then apply PCA to these model populations. Our baseline model assumes that halo
mass, spin parameter, and formation redshift are the governing input parameters
and that star formation is determined by surface density through a Schmidt law.
  In all cases, the first principal component is primarily a measure of the
shape of the spectral energy distribution (SED), and it is usually driven by
variations in the spin parameter, which influences star formation through the
disk surface density. The second and (in some cases) third principal components
consist mainly of ``scale'' parameters like luminosity, disk radius, and
circular velocity. However, the detailed division of these scale parameters,
the disk surface brightness, and the rotation curve slope among the principal
components changes significantly from model to model. Our calculations yield
predictions of principal component structure for the baseline model of disk
galaxy formation, and a physical interpretation of these predictions. They also
show that PCA can test the core assumptions of that model and reveal the
presence of additional physical parameters that may govern observable galaxy
properties.

model (LCDM) has proven to be remarkably successful on large scales, on
subgalactic scales it faces some potentially fatal difficulties; these include
over-producing dwarf satellite galaxies and predicting excessive central
densities in dark halos. Among the most natural cosmological solutions to these
problems is to replace cold dark matter with a warm species (LWDM). The warm
component acts to reduce the small-scale power, resulting in fewer galactic
subhalos and lower halo central densities. An alternative model with a mild
``tilt'' in the inflationary power spectrum (TLCDM; n =0.9) similarly reduces
the central densities of dark halos, although the substructure abundance
remains relatively high. Here I argue that because dwarf galaxy formation
should be suppressed in the presence of a strong ionizing background, favored
LWDM models will generally under-predict the observed abundance of dwarf
galaxies. The satellite count for TLCDM fairs much better, as long as the
photoionization effect is taken into account. TLCDM provides a more successful
alternative to LWDM on subgalactic scales with the added attraction that it
relies on only a minor, natural adjustment to the standard framework of CDM.

account of evolution, the distribution of magnitude measurement errors and

by a Schechter function with M* -5log h =-19.66+/-0.07, alpha=-1.21+/-0.03 and

density of rho_L=(1.82+/-0.17) 10^8 h L_sol/Mpc^3 (assuming an Omega_0=0.3,

of the photometric zeropoint, large scale structure in the galaxy distribution

corrections. Our luminosity function is in excellent agreement with, but has
much smaller statistical errors than an estimate from the Sloan Digital Sky

the current 2dFGRS catalogue, and its weak dependence on apparent magnitude, to
define a complete description of the 2dFGRS selection function. Details and

homogeneous modes of the instantons, finding unstable modes which render the
instantons sub-dominant contributions in the path integral. We show that a
suitable condition may be imposed on singular closed instantons, constraining
their instabilities. With this constraint these instantons can provide a

time significantly with no sacrifice in the accuracy of the results. We applied
this numerical method to the Lya transfer in a static, uniform, dustless, and
plane-parallel medium. Two types of photon sources have been considered, the
midplane source and the uniformly distributed sources. The emergent profiles
show double peaks and absorption trough at the line-center. We compared our
results with the analytic solutions derived by previous researchers, and
confirmed that both solutions are in good agreement with each other. We
investigated the directionality of the emergent Lya photons and found that limb
brightening is observed in slightly thick media while limb darkening appears in
extremely thick media. The behavior of the directionality is noted to follow
that of the Thomson scattered radiation in electron clouds, because both Lya
wing scattering and Thomson scattering share the same Rayleigh scattering phase
function. The mean number of wing scatterings just before escape is in exact
agreement with the prediction of the diffusion approximation. The Lya photons
constituting the inner part of the emergent profiles follow the relationship
derived from the diffusion approximation. We present a brief discussion on the

  this version",,"10.1023/A:1020472526203",,"astro-ph",,"  One of the fundamental aspects of statistical behaviour in many-body systems
is exponential divergence of neighbouring orbits, which is often discussed in
terms of Liapounov exponents. Here we study this topic for the classical
gravitational N-body problem. The application we have in mind is to old stellar
systems such as globular star clusters, where N~10^6, and so we concentrate on
spherical, centrally concentrated systems with total energy E<0. Hitherto no
connection has been made between the time scale for divergence (denoted here by
t_e) and the two-body relaxation time scale (t_r), even though both may be
calculated by consideration of two-body encounters.
  In this paper we give a simplified model showing that divergence in phase
space is initially roughly exponential, on a timescale proportional to the
crossing time (defined as a mean time for a star to cross from one side of the
system to another). In this phase t_e is much less than t_r, if N is not too
small (i.e. N is much more than about 30). After several e-folding times, the
model shows that the divergence slows down. Thereafter the divergence (measured
by the energies of the bodies) varies with time as t^{1/2}, on a timescale
nearly proportional to the familiar two-body relaxation timescale, i.e. t_e ~
t_r in this phase. These conclusions are illustrated by numerical results.

either the thermal energy or the entropy as an independent variable in smoothed
particle hydrodynamics (SPH). In this context, we derive a new version of SPH
that manifestly conserves both energy and entropy if smoothing lengths are
allowed to adapt freely to the local mass resolution. To test various formu-
lations of SPH, we consider point-like energy injection and find that powerful
explosions are well represented by SPH even when the energy is deposited into a
single particle, provided that the entropy equation is integrated. If the
thermal energy is instead used as an independent variable, unphysical solutions
can be obtained for this problem. We also examine the radiative cooling of gas
spheres that collapse and virialize in isolation and of halos that form in
cosmological simulations of structure formation. When applied to these
problems, the thermal energy version of SPH leads to substantial overcooling in
halos that are resolved with up to a few thousand particles, while the entropy
formulation is biased only moderately low for these halos. For objects resolved
with much larger particle numbers, the two approaches yield consistent results.
We trace the origin of the differences to systematic resolution effects in the
outer parts of cooling flows. The cumulative effect of this overcooling can be
significant. In cosmological simulations of moderate size, we find that the
fraction of baryons which cool and condense can be reduced by up to a factor ~2
if the entropy equation is employed rather than the thermal energy equation. We
also demonstrate that the entropy method leads to a greatly reduced scatter in
the density-temperature relation of the low-density Ly-alpha forest relative to
the thermal energy approach, in accord with theoretical expectations.(abridged)

with ASCA, assuming that the hot gas is spherically symmetric and in
hydrostatic equilibrium. The projected mass within an arc radius, $r_{\rm
arc}$, of 110 kpc is $M(r_{\rm arc})=1.2^{+0.8}_{-0.4} \times10^{13} \MO$. This
is 18 -- 45% of the mass previously derived from a lensing analysis by
Campusano et al. (1998, AAA 069.160.189) without any X-ray information.
  The primary cause of this discrepancy is in their assumption that the center
of the cluster potential coincides with the position of the brightest cluster
galaxy (BCG), while we reveal the BCG position to be 60$''$ outside of the
X-ray center. We further calculated a model for the source galaxy position and
the gravitational potential that can reproduce both the X-ray data and the arc

The temperature variation and the field dependence of ZS was measured by a
dielectric resonator cavity technique in the microwave region. In particular,
the temperature variation of the magnetic penetration depth was also determined
in the RF region by a single coil mutual inductance method. In the case of the
films, for T<TC/2 a clear exponential behavior of the penetration depth is
observed, which can be explained by a simple BCS s-wave model with a reduced
value of the energy gap. On the contrary, pellets show no evidence of
saturation, and the experimental results strictly follow a quadratic dependence
down to the lowest temperatures. This behavior can be induced by the presence
of metallic Mg inclusions that may locally depress the gap. The analysis of the
field dependence of the surface impedance in the microwave region confirms that
the electrodynamic response of MgB2 is dominated by different sources of
dissipation, depending on the sample history, likely to be ascribed to the
predominance of grain boundaries or normal regions on its surface.

HTSC). However, it is emphasized here that in this T-region the resistivity is
not proportional to T but is only linear in T. This fact indicates to
T-independent contribution to normal-state resistivity in HTSC-cuprates
(magnetic contribution, in our treatment) which behavior, in its turn,
indicates to possible magnetic (SDW-like) phase transition before SC transition
in HTSC-system. SDW-gap (measured as pseudogap with d-wave symmetry, in our
treatment) is formed at the symmetrical parts of the Fermi surface above Tc and
persists in SC state. The magnitude of SDW-gap is essentially larger than that
for SC-gap. So, SDW formed can mimic d-wave symmetry of the order parameter
measured below Tc (which is now attributed to d-wave pairing). On the other
hand, since the Gruneisen-Bloch curve appears to be (in approach used) a
geometric locus for the Tc(onset)(H) (as in LTSC) this fact evidents about
EPI-nature (BCS) of SC transition (s-wave) in high-Tc oxides. The proposal to
increase Tc using above (SDW/CDW/SC) model (and possible realization) is

susceptibility and superconducting fluctuations are self-consistently
determined by the SC-FLEX+T-matrix approximation. The longitudinal and
transverse conductivities are calculated by using the Eliashberg and
Kohno-Yamada formalism. The effects of the spin fluctuations and
superconducting fluctuations are estimated, respectively. The vertex
corrections arising from the two fluctuations are also calculated. The
additional contribution from the Aslamazov-Larkin term is also estimated beyond

  It is shown that the main effect of the superconducting fluctuations is the
feedback effect through the spin fluctuations. The correct results are obtained
by considering the superconducting fluctuations and the spin fluctuations
simultaneously. The temperature and doping dependences of the resistivity and
the Hall coefficient are well explained. We point out that the characteristic

Massey products' associated with flat graded superbundles. As examples, we
consider a class of graded D-brane pairs of unit relative grade. Upon computing
the holomorphic potential, we study their moduli space of composites. In

the spacetime is well defined near the AdS horizon, in contrast to the

N\'um. 2. 2003. Pag. 83-93",,"MA1-03-01X","math.AT math.GT",,"  We propose a method for calculating cohomology operations for finite
simplicial complexes. Of course, there exist well--known methods for computing
(co)homology groups, for example, the reduction algorithm consisting in
reducing the matrices corresponding to the differential in each dimension to
the Smith normal form, from which one can read off (co)homology groups of the
complex, or the incremental algorithm (due to Edelsbrunner et al.) for
computing Betti numbers. However, there is a gap in the literature concerning
general methods for computing cohomology operations. For a given finite
simplicial complex K, we sketch a procedure including the computation of some
primary and secondary cohomology operations and the $A_{\infty}$--algebra
structure on the cohomology of K. This method is based on the transcription of
the reduction algorithm mentioned above, in terms of a special type of
algebraic homotopy equivalences, called a contraction, of the (co)chain complex
of K to a ""minimal"" (co)chain complex M(K). For instance, whenever the ground
ring is a field or the (co)homology of K is free, then M(K) is isomorphic to
the (co)homology of K. Combining this contraction with the combinatorial
formulae for Steenrod reduced $p$th powers at cochain level developed in
\cite{GR99} and \cite{Gon00}, these operations at cohomology level can be
computed. Finally, a method for calculating Adem secondary cohomology
operations $\Phi_q: Ker(Sq^2H^q(K))\ra H^{q+3}(K)/Sq^2H^q(K)$ is showed.

"math/0110333","Peter Krikelis","Constantin M. Petridi, P. B. Krikelis","Mathematical Structures Defined by Identities","31 pages",,,,"math.RA math.LO",,"  We propound the thesis that there is a limitation to the number of possible
structures which are axiomatically endowed with identities involving
operations. In the case of algebras with a binary operation satisfying a
formally reducible (to be explained) identity between two n-iterates of the
operation, it is established that the frequency of such algebras goes to zero
as n tends to infinity. This is proved by a suitable ordering and labeling of
the expressions (words) of the corresponding free algebra and the formation of
a series of tableaux whose entries are the labels. The tableaux reveal
surprising symmetry properties, stated in terms of the Catalan numbers and
their partitions. As a result of the defining identity and the tableaux all
iterates of order higher than n fall into equivalence classes of semantically
equal ones. Classnumbers depending on the tableaux are calculated for all
algebras of order n = 3 (and partially for n = 4). Certain classnumbers are
invariants in the sense that for algebras of same order they are equal.
Algebras with several operations of any arity are considered. A generalization
of Catalan numbers depending on homorphisms of the structure is proposed and
corresponding generating functions set up. As an example of this, a kind of
skein polynomials are constructed characterizing the formal build-up of
iterates. As no distinction is made between the various algebras, isomorphic or
not, which are models of the identity the results can also be formulated in
terms of varieties with signature the identity in question.

First, the syzygies of arbitrary representations of a finite dimensional string
algebra $\Lambda$ are direct sums of cyclic representations, and the left
finitistic dimensions, both little and big, of $\Lambda$ can be computed from a
finite set of cyclic left ideals contained in the Jacobson radical. Second, our
main result shows that the functorial finiteness status of the full subcategory
$\Cal P$ consisting of the finitely generated left $\Lambda$-modules of finite
projective dimension is completely determined by a finite number of, possibly
infinite dimensional, string modules -- one for each simple $\Lambda$-module --
which are algorithmically constructible from quiver and relations of $\Lambda$.
Namely, $\Cal P$ is contravariantly finite in $\Lambda$-mod precisely when all
of these string modules are finite dimensional, in which case they coincide
with the minimal $\Cal P$-approximations of the corresponding simple modules.
Yet, even when $\Cal P$ fails to be contravariantly finite, these
`characteristic' string modules encode, in an accessible format, all desirable
homological information about $\Lambda$-mod.

summarizes my talk during 2001'th workshop at John Hopkins University. The main
idea in this talk is to show how the Bayesian inference can naturally give us
all the necessary tools we need to solve real inverse problems: starting by
simple inversion where we assume to know exactly the forward model and all the
input model parameters up to more realistic advanced problems of myopic or
blind inversion where we may be uncertain about the forward model and we may
have noisy data. Starting by an introduction to inverse problems through a few
examples and explaining their ill posedness nature, I briefly presented the
main classical deterministic methods such as data matching and classical
regularization methods to show their limitations. I then presented the main
classical probabilistic methods based on likelihood, information theory and
maximum entropy and the Bayesian inference framework for such problems. I show
that the Bayesian framework, not only generalizes all these methods, but also
gives us natural tools, for example, for inferring the uncertainty of the
computed solutions, for the estimation of the hyperparameters or for handling
myopic or blind inversion problems. Finally, through a deconvolution problem
example, I presented a few state of the art methods based on Bayesian inference
particularly designed for some of the mass spectrometry data processing
problems.

  secular increase in the mass of ponderable bodies","Original G data (Table) & Fitting Chi-square test included; Planets
  discussed in separate section (IV.D.); Perihelion prec. discussed; Fig. 2
  removed",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  In spite of two hundred years of considerable efforts directed towards
improvement in the experimental techniques, gravitational measurements have
provided unsettled results for Newton's gravitational constant G. Analysis of
the published (over ~75 years) small-scale gravitational measurements,
presented in this report, unveils a large secular increase in the gravitational
force, that reveals itself as a formal increase in the Newton's constant G at a
rate 'G dot per G' = (1.43 +-0.08) x 10^(-5) year^(-1). Since its
interpretation as a true 'G dot per G' effect is excluded by laser and radar
ranging to the Moon and the interior planets as well as by double-pulsar
studies, which all put tight limits on any variation in G, this large secular
effect appears to originate in a temporal increase of gravitational masses due
to, e.g., capture of mass from a hypothetical cold dark matter halo of the Sun.
By virtue of the equivalence principle, the secular mass increase leads
naturally to modifications of the Newtonian dynamics in the Solar System, as it
predicts a cosmic deceleration of moving bodies dependent upon their speed. In
particular, it predicts for the Pioneer 10/11 spacecraft an anomalous, nearly
constant acceleration of -(11.0 +-1.8) x 10^(-10) m/s^2, in agreement with the
published experimental value of -(8.7 +- 0.9) x 10^(-10) m/s^2. Dynamical
effects of this kind have been also detected in the motion of other spacecraft
and artificial satellites, but not in the motion of large and/or old objects in
the Solar System.

states are studied. We show that the set of states in the GHZ class breaks into
an infinite number of disjoint classes under this type of transformation. These
classes are characterized by the value of a quantity that is invariant under
these transformations, and is defined in terms of the coefficients of a
particular canonical form in which only states in the GHZ class can be
expressed. This invariant also imposes a strong constraint on any POVM that is
part of a deterministic protocol. We also consider a transformation generated
by a local 2-outcome POVM and study under what conditions it is deterministic,
i.e., both outcomes belong to the same orbit. We prove that for real states it
is always possible to find such a POVM and we discuss analytical and numerical
evidence that suggests that this result also holds for complex states. We study
the transformation generated in the space of orbits when one or more parties
apply several deterministic POVMs in succession and use these results to give a
complete characterization of the real states that can be obtained from the GHZ
state with probability 1.

barrier crossing dynamics. Based on an initial coherent state representation of
bath oscillators and an equilibrium canonical distribution of quantum
mechanical mean values of their co-ordinates and momenta we have derived a
$c$-number generalized quantum Langevin equation. The approach allows us to
implement the method of classical non-Markovian Brownian motion to realize an
exact generalized non-Markovian quantum Kramers' equation. The equation is
valid for arbitrary temperature and friction. We have solved this equation in
the spatial diffusion-limited regime to derive quantum Kramers' rate of barrier
crossing and analyze its variation as a function of temperature and friction.
While almost all the earlier theories rest on quasi-probability distribution
functions (like Wigner function) and path integral methods, the present work is
based on {\it true probability distribution functions} and is independent of
path integral techniques. The theory is a natural extension of the classical
theory to quantum domain and provides a unified description of thermal
activated processes and tunneling.
