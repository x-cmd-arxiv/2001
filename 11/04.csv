  in the Astronomical Journal",,"10.1086/322994",,"astro-ph",,"  We present moderate-resolution spectroscopy of globular clusters (GCs) around
the Sa/Sb spiral galaxy M81 (NGC 3031). Sixteen candidate clusters were
observed with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph on the Keck I telescope.
All are confirmed as bona fide GCs, although one of the clusters appears to
have been undergoing a transient event during our observations. In general, the
M81 globular cluster system (GCS) is found to be very similar to the Milky Way
(MW) and M31 systems, both chemically and kinematically. A kinematic analysis
of the velocities of 44 M81 GCS, (the 16 presented here and 28 from previous
work) strongly suggests that the red, metal-rich clusters are rotating in the
same sense as the gas in the disk of M81. The blue, metal-poor clusters have
halo-like kinematics, showing no evidence for rotation. The kinematics of
clusters whose projected galactocentric radii lie between 4 and 8 kpc suggest
that they are rotating much more than those which lie outside these bounds. We
suggest that these rotating, intermediate-distance clusters are analogous to
the kinematic sub-population in the metal-rich, disk GCs observed in the MW and
we present evidence for the existence of a similar sub-population in the
metal-rich clusters of M31. With one exception, all of the M81 clusters in our
sample have ages that are consistent with MW and M31 GCs. One cluster may be as
young as a few Gyrs. The correlations between absorption-line indices
established for MW and M31 GCs also hold in the M81 cluster system, at least at
the upper end of the metallicity distribution (which our sample probes). On the
whole, the mean metallicity of the M81 GCS is similar to the metallicity of the
MW and M31 GCSs. The projected mass of M81 is similar to the masses of the MW
and M31. Its mass profile indicates the presence of a dark matter halo.

to integer values (in units of electronic charge) of the charge pumped during

algorithms of arbitrarily high orders in the time step for precise integration
of motion in classical and quantum mechanics simulations. Within this approach
the basic algorithms are first derived up to the eighth order by direct
decompositions of exponential propagators and further collected using an
advanced composition scheme to obtain the algorithms of higher orders. Contrary
to the scheme by Chin and Kidwell [Phys. Rev. E 62, 8746 (2000)], where
high-order algorithms are introduced by standard iterations of a force-gradient
integrator of order four, the present method allows to reduce the total number
of expensive force and its gradient evaluations to a minimum. At the same time,
the precision of the integration increases significantly, especially with
increasing the order of the generated schemes. The algorithms are tested in
molecular dynamics and celestial mechanics simulations. It is shown, in
particular, that the efficiency of the new fourth-order-based algorithms is
better approximately in factors 5 to 1000 for orders 4 to 12, respectively. The
results corresponding to sixth- and eighth-order-based composition schemes are
also presented up to the sixteenth order. For orders 14 and 16, such highly
precise schemes, at considerably smaller computational costs, allow to reduce
unphysical deviations in the total energy up in 100 000 times with respect to
those of the standard fourth-order-based iteration approach.
