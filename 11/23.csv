A family of smooth lens models can precisely predict certain combinations of

observed lens systems we show that real galaxies {\it cannot} be described by
smooth singular isothermal ellipsoids, nor by the more general elliptical
power-law potentials. Large scale distortions from the elliptical models can
not yet be ruled out. Nevertheless we find, by comparing with simulations, that
the data can be accounted for by a significant ($\sim 5-10%$) amount of dark
substructures within a projected distance of several kpc from the center of
lenses. This interpretation favors the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model other the
warm or self-interacting DM models.

formed in three N-body simulations. These have initially the same disc and the
same halo-to-disc mass ratio, but their haloes have very different central
concentrations. The third model includes a bulge. The bar in the model with the
centrally concentrated halo (model MH) is much stronger, longer and thinner
than the bar in the model with the less centrally concentrated halo (model MD).
Its shape, when viewed side-on, evolves from boxy to peanut and then to
X-shaped, as opposed to that of model MD, which stays boxy. The projected
density profiles obtained from cuts along the bar major axis, both for the
face-on and the edge-on views, show a flat part, as opposed to those of model
MD which are falling rapidly. A Fourier analysis of the face-on density
distribution of model MH shows very large m = 2, 4, 6 and 8 components.
Contrary to this for model MD the components m = 6 and 8 are negligible. The
velocity field of model MH shows strong deviations from axial symmetry, and in
particular has wavy isovelocities near the end of the bar when viewed along the
bar minor axis. When viewed edge-on, it shows cylindrical rotation, which the
MD model does not. The properties of the bar of the model with a bulge and a
non-centrally concentrated halo (MDB) are intermediate between those of the bar
of the other two models. All three models exhibit a lot of inflow of the disc
material during their evolution, so that by the end of the simulations the disc
dominates over the halo in the inner parts, even for model MH, for which the
halo and disc contributions were initially comparable in that region.

neutron stars, black hole-neutron star systems and double black holes. We also

identify a significant number of new formation channels for double neutron
stars, in particular, leading to populations with very distinct properties. We
discuss the theoretical and observational implications of such populations, but
we also note the need for hydrodynamical calculations to settle the question of
whether such common-envelope evolution is possible. We also present and discuss
the physical properties of compact object binaries and identify a number of
robust, qualitative features as well as their origin. Using the calculated
coalescence rates we compare our results to earlier studies and derive expected

medium is likely to appear in the vicinity of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
associated with massive stars. The interaction of the blast wave with this
medium is described through a reverse shock and a forward shock. We show that
the reverse shock is initially relativistic if the factor of a density jump
($\alpha$) is much larger than 21, and Newtonian if $1<\alpha\ll 21$. We also
calculate light curves of the afterglow emission during the interaction if the
reverse shock is relativistic, and find that the optical flux density initially
decays abruptly, then rises rapidly, and finally fades based on a power-law,
which could be followed by an abrupt decay when the reverse shock has just
crossed the originally swept-up matter. Therefore, one property of an afterglow
occurring in a large-density-jump medium is an abrupt drop followed by a bump
in the light curve and thus provides a probe of circumburst environments. In
addition, this property could not only account for the optical afterglows of
GRB 970508 and GRB 000301C but also explain the X-ray afterglow of GRB 981226.

volume fraction sampled. We show that the observed projected X-ray emission
mimics the multi-phase status of the plasma even though the input distribution

insufficient spatial resolution is accessible, (ii) the central bin when its

One of examples of such kind of signals is presented by seismograms containing

here a discrete stochastic model for possible solution of a problem of strong
EQ's forecasting and differentiation of TE's from the weak EQ's. Theoretical

supermultiplet for CompHEP software package. The model contains MSSM content
supplemented by three new fields: {\it goldstino} -- two component spinor,
scalar {\it sgoldstino} and pseudoscalar {\it sgoldstino}. To the leading order
in 1/F, where F is the parameter of supersymmetry breaking, and to zero order
in MSSM gauge and Yukawa coupling constants, the interactions between the
component fields of goldstino supermultiplet and MSSM fields are derived. They
correspond to the most attractive for collider studies processes where only one
of these {\it new} particles appears in a final state. In this case light
gravitino behaves exactly as goldstino. For sgoldstinos, as they are R-even, we
include in the package only sgoldstino couplings to goldstino and sgoldstino
couplings to SM fields as the most interesting phenomenologically. All new
coupling constants between the components of goldstino supermultiplet and MSSM
fields are completely determined by the ratios of soft supersymmetry breaking
parameters and F. Thus, in addition to the MSSM coupling constants there are
three new parameters in the package: the scale of supersymmetry breaking,
$\sqrt{F}$, and masses of scalar and pseudoscalar sgoldstinos. The CompHEP
notations for the new fields and parameters are presented. The package was
successfully tested and all relevant results known in literature have been
reproduced with good accuracy. It may be used in order to calculate any

of models is quite limited. Using Affleck-Dine-Seiberg superpotential one
obtains a scalar potential $V=\Lm_c^{4+n}\phi^{-n}$. Models with $2<n<4.27$ or
equivalently $2\times 10^{-2} GeV < \Lm_c < 6 \times 10^3 GeV$ do not satisfy

Gravitinos can be produced both at the preheating stage and at the subsequent

calculate the interaction potential for all combinations of kinks and antikinks
in $SU(5)\times Z_2$ and study their collisions. The outcome of kink-antikink

width $\Gamma$ of the local density of states and the Lyapunov exponent. As the
perturbation strength is increased one obtains a cross-over between both
regimes. These predictions are based on situations where the Fermi Golden Rule
(FGR) is valid. By considering a paradigmatic fully chaotic system, the
Bunimovich stadium billiard, with a perturbation in a regime for which the FGR

of nuclear matter (NM) from the analysis of simulations of fragmentation events
in intermediate energy heavy ion collisions.
  For charge asymmetric systems a qualitative new feature in the liquid-gas
phase transition is predicted: the onset of chemical instabilities with a
mixture of isoscalar and isovector components. This leads to a separation into
a higher density (``liquid'') symmetric and a low density (``gas'')
neutron-rich phase, the so-called neutron distillation effect. We analyse the
simulations with respect to the time evolution of the isospin dynamics, as well
as with respect to the distribution and asymmetry of the final primary
fragments. Qualitatively different effects arise in central collisions, with
bulk fragmentation, and peripheral collisions with neck-fragmentation. The neck
fragments produced in this type of process appear systematically more
neutron-rich from a dynamical nucleon migration effect which is very sensitive
to the symmetry term in regions just below normal density. In general the
isospin dynamics plays an important role in all the steps of the reaction, from
prompt nucleon emission to the sequential decay of the primary fragments. A
fully microscopic description of the reaction dynamics including stochastic
elements to treat fluctuations realistically is absolutely necessary in order
to extract precise information on the fragmentation and the nuclear equation of
state. We have performed simulations for fragment production events in $n$-rich
($^{124}Sn$) and $n$-poor ($^{112}Sn$) symmetric colliding systems.

of the equivalence postulate, and grounding one self on both relativistic and
quantum Lagrangians, we construct a Lagrangian of relativistic quantum system
in one dimension and derive a third order equation of motion representing a
first integral of the relativistic quantum Newton's law. Then, we investigate
the free particle case and establish the photon's trajectories.

possible given quantum memory and the ability to perform projective
measurements on up to 4-qubits. We describe an improved method that requires
only 2-qubit measurements, which are both sufficient and necessary. We present
a method to partially collapse the $C_k$-hierarchy in the indirect construction
of unitary gates [Gottesman and Chuang, Nature, {\bf 402} 309 (1999)], and
apply the method to find discrete universal sets of 2-qubit measurements.

the usually considered modulo 2\pi topological phases is demonstrated with the
help of computer simulation of a model adiabatic evolution whose parameters are
varied along a closed loop in the parameter space. Using the analogy of Berry's
phase with the Dirac monopole, it is concluded that an interferometer loop
taken around a magnetic monopole of strength n/2 yields an observable 2n\pi
phase shift, where n is an integer. An experiment to observe the effect is
proposed.

local operation, that all nonlocal variables related to two or more separate
sites can be measured instantaneously, except for a finite time required for
bringing to one location the classical records from these sites which yield the
result of the measurement. It is a verification measurement: it yields reliably
the eigenvalues of the nonlocal variables, but it does not prepare the
eigenstates of the system.
