transient X-ray source turning on in August 2001, as noted with the RXTE
All-Sky Monitor. We carried out a short target of opportunity observation with
the Chandra X-ray Observatory and are able to associate the transient with the
brightest of 24 X-ray sources detected during quiescence in July 2000 with
Chandra. Furthermore, we securely identify the optical counterpart and
determine that the 1998 X-ray outburst in NGC 6440 was from the same object.
This is the first time that an optical counterpart to a transient in a globular
cluster is securely identified. Since the transient is a type I X-ray burster,
it is established that the compact accretor is a neutron star. Thus, this
transient provides an ideal case to study the quiescent emission in the optical
and X-ray of a transiently accreting neutron star while knowing the distance
and reddening accurately. One model that fits the quiescent spectrum is an
absorbed power law plus neutron star hydrogen atmosphere model. We find an
intrinsic neutron star radius of 17_{-12}^{+31} km and an unabsorbed bolometric
luminosity for the neutron star atmosphere of (2.1+/-0.8)E33 erg/s which is
consistent with predictions for a cooling neutron star.

with the ISOPHOT photometer aboard the ISO satellite. The observations make it
possible for the first time to study the properties of the large dust grains in
L183 without confusion from smaller grains. The observations show clear colour
temperature variations which are likely to be caused by changes in the emission
properties of the dust particles. In the cloud core the far-infrared colour
temperature drops below 12K. The data allow a new determination of the cloud
mass and the mass distribution. The mass within a radius of 10 arcmin from the
cloud centre is 25 Msun. We have mapped the cloud in several molecular lines
including DCO+(2-1) and H13CO+(1-0). These species are believed to be tracers
of cold and dense molecular material and we detect a strong anticorrelation
between the DCO+ emission and the dust colour temperatures. In particular, the
DCO+(2-1) emission is not detected towards the maximum of the 100um emission
where the colour temperature rises above 15K. The H13CO+ emission follows the
DCO+ distribution but CO isotopes show strong emission even towards the 100um
peak. A comparison of the DCO+ and C18O maps shows sharp variations in the
relative intensities of the species. Morphologically the 200um dust emission
traces the distribution of dense molecular material as seen e.g. in C18O lines.
A comparison with dust column density shows that C18O is depleted by a factor
of 1.5 in the cloud core. We present results of R- and B-band starcounts. The
extinction is much better correlated with the 200um than with the 100um
emission. Based on the 200um correlation at low extinction values we deduce a
value of ~17mag for the visual extinction towards the cloud centre.

often varying in a correlated way. This includes both dramatic flares lasting a
few hours in which the line flux nearly doubles and lower-level flickering. The
strongest flares involve development of asymmetry in the line profile, with the

is the case, but we discuss several possible explanations. We consider the
energetics of the flares and compare with plausible models including
chromospheric activity on the companion star, local magnetic reconnection
events within the disc and a varying irradiation from close to the black hole.

inverse-Compton scattering on the cooling frequency in the synchrotron
component and therefore on the light curve decay index. We find that there are
two kinds of light-curve break for the jet effect. The first is an ``adiabatic
break'' if the electrons become slow cooling before the jet enters a spreading
phase, and the second is a ``radiative break'' which appears on the contrary
case. We then show how a relativistic jet evolves dynamically and derive the
overall temporal synchrotron emission in both cases, focusing on the change in
light curve decay index around the break time. Finally, in view of our results,
we rule out two cases for relativistic jets to account for the observed light
curve breaks in a few afterglows: (i) an adiabatic jet with strong Compton
cooling (Y>1) and with the cooling frequency nu_c locating in the observed
energy range; (ii) a radiative jet with a significant fraction of total energy

lithium depletion: 1- a rapid nuclear destruction in the T-Tauri phase before
20 Myrs : this is independent of the mass used within our range but largely
dependent on the extension and temperature of the convective zone, 2- a second
phase where the destruction is slow and moderate and which is largely dependent
on the (magneto)hydrodynamic instability located at the base of the convective
zone.
  In terms of composition, we show the interest on considering helium and
especially the mixture of heavy elements : carbon, oxygen, silicium and iron.
We outline the importance of O/Fe ratio. We note a reasonable agreement on
lithium depletion for the two best known cases, the Sun and the Hyades cluster
for solar-like stars. Other clusters suggest that processes which may partly
inhibit the predicted premainsequence depletion cannot be excluded, in
particular for stars below ~ 0.9M Sun. Finally we suggest different research

general, a more stable structure of the boundary layer corresponds to a lower
value of the $\alpha$ - indicator, i.e. larger anti-persistence, thus a set of
fluctuations tending to induce a greater stability of the stratocumulus. In
contrast, during periods of higher instability in the marine boundary, less
anti-persistent (more persistent like) behavior of the system drags it out of
equilibrium, corresponding to larger $\alpha$ values. From an analysis of the
frequency spectrum, the stratocumulus base height evolution is found to be a
non-stationary process with stationary increments. The occurrence of these
statistics in cloud base height fluctuations suggests the usefulness of similar

recent experiments revealing rich wetting behaviour of n-alkane/methanol

heuristic, is based on a microscopic lattice-gas model from which a Cahn-Landau
approach is distilled. Besides the physics associated with the short-range
components of the intermolecular interactions, effects of the long-range tails
of the net van der Waals forces between interfaces are also taken into account.
Including weak long-range forces which favour wetting in the theory does not
visibly alter the critical wetting transition for the nonane/methanol mixture,
in contrast with the generic expectation of first-order wetting for such
systems, but in good agreement with experiment. For decane/methanol weak
long-range forces bring the transition very close to the prewetting critical
point, leading to an adsorption behaviour closely reminiscent of short-range

simultaneously allows for the influence of the misfit strain imposed on the
film lattice by a thick substrate. Numerical calculations are performed for
PbTiO3 and BaTiO3 films under an assumption of the polarization reduction in
surface layers. The film mean polarization is calculated as a function of film
thickness, temperature, and misfit strain. It is shown that the negative
intrinsic size effect is reduced in epitaxial films due to the in-plane
compression of the film lattice. At room temperature, strong reduction of the
mean polarization may take place only in ultrathin films (thickness ~ 1 nm).
Theoretical predictions are compared with the available experimental data on

to $\nu_e$'s, while the ES reaction also has a small sensitivity to
$\nu_{\mu}$'s and $\nu_{\tau}$'s.
  The flux of $\nu_e$'s from ^8B decay measured by the CC reaction rate is
$\phi^CC (\nu_e) = 1.75 \pm 0.07 (stat.)^{+0.1 2}_{-0.11} (sys.) \pm 0.05

inferred from the ES reaction rate is $\phi^ES (\nu_x)=2.39\pm 0.34 (stat.)

  Comparison of $\phi^CC (\nu_e)$ to the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration's
precision value of $\phi^ES (\nu_x)$ yields a $3.3\sigma$ difference, assuming
the systematic uncertainties are normally distributed, providing evidence that
there is a non-electron flavor active neutrino component in the solar flux. The
total flux of active ^8B neutrinos is thus determined to be $5.44\pm 0.99

interaction cross section is derived by using the QCD factorization formula
combined with the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude for the heavy quark bound state. Our
result shows the equivalence of this approach with the operator product
expansion even for the bound state scattering to leading order in QCD. We also
apply the formula to the charmonium system and investigate the relativistic
correction coming from the phase space of the reaction. We find that although
$J/\psi$-gluon cross-section gets a large relativistic correction at higher
energies, the correction becomes small in the $J/\psi$-hadron cross section due
to the increase of the gluon distribution at smaller $x$ inside the hadron.

Because this symmetry is broken very weakly $\theta_\odot$ does not deviate
much from $\tan^2 \theta_\odot=1$ which is its value in the symmetric limit.
This gives a mismatch with LMA solution where mixing is large but not exactly
maximal. We confront this property of Zee mass matrix by phenomenologically
analyzing recent results from solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillation
experiments at various confidence levels. We conclude that LOW type solution is
compatible with the Zee mass matrix at 99% confidence level when atmospheric
neutrino deficit is explained by maximal $\nu_\mu \leftrightarrow \nu_\tau$
oscillation. Thus the minimal version of the Zee model even though disfavored
by the LMA type or VO type solutions, is compatible with LOW type solution of

are complete on a complex line bundle over CP^3. The principal orbits are S^7,
described as a triaxially squashed S^3 bundle over S^4. The behaviour in the
S^3 directions is similar to that in the Atiyah-Hitchin metric, and we show how
this leads to an M-theory interpretation with orientifold D6-branes wrapped
over S^4. We then consider new G_2 metrics which we denote by C_7, which are
complete on an R^2 bundle over T^{1,1}, with principal orbits that are
S^3\times S^3. We study the C_7 metrics using numerical methods, and we find
that they have the remarkable property of admitting a U(1) Killing vector whose
length is nowhere zero or infinite. This allows one to make an everywhere
non-singular reduction of an M-theory solution to give a solution of the type
IIA theory. The solution has two non-trivial S^2 cycles, and both carry
magnetic charge with respect to the R-R vector field. We also discuss some
four-dimensional hyper-Kahler metrics described recently by Cherkis and
Kapustin, following earlier work by Kronheimer. We show that in certain cases
these metrics, whose explicit form is known only asymptotically, can be related
to metrics characterised by solutions of the su(\infty) Toda equation, which

in the construction of 2-dimensional non-linear sigma model with the conifolds
as target spaces. The action for the sigma model is shown to be bounded from
below. By a suitable choice of the 'integration constants', arising in the
solution of Ricci flatness requirement, the metric and the equations of motion
are found to be {\it{non-singular}}. As the target space is Ricci flat, the
perturbative 1-loop counter terms being absent, the model becomes topological.

closer to the analytic formula obtained by Krauth-Nicolai-Staudacher as we

Blocks algorithm for estimating signals in noisy time series data (Scargle
1998, 2000). The mathematical problem is to find the partition of the data
space with the maximum posterior probability for a model consisting of a
homogeneous Poisson process for each partition element. For model M_{n},
attributing the data within region n of the data space to a Poisson process
with a fixed event rate lambda_{n}, the global posterior is:
  P(M_{n}) = Phi(N,V) = Gamma(N+1)Gamma(V-N+1) / Gamma(V+2) = N!(V-N)!/(V+1)! .
  Note that lambda_{n} does not appear, since it has been marginalized, using a
flat, improper prior. Other priors yield similar formulas. This expression is
valid for a data space of any dimension. It depends on only N, the number of
data points within the region, and V, the volume of the region. No information
about the actual locations of the points enters this expression.
  Suppose two such regions, described by N_{1},V_{1} and N_{2},V_{2}, are
candidates for being merged into one. From the above equation, construct a
Bayes merge factor, giving the ratio of posteriors for the two regions merged
and not merged, respectively:
  P(Merge) = Phi(N_{1}+N_{2},V_{1}+V_{2}) / Phi(N_{1},V_{1}) Phi(N_{2},V_{2}) .
  Then collect data points into blocks with a greedy cell coalescence
algorithm.

biological signals are ``noisy'', heterogeneous and exhibit different types of

nonstationarities often encountered in real data. Specifically, we consider
nonstationary sequences formed in three ways: (i) stitching together segments
of data obtained from discontinuous experimental recordings, or removing some
noisy and unreliable parts from continuous recordings and stitching together
the remaining parts -- a ``cutting'' procedure commonly used in preparing data
prior to signal analysis; (ii) adding to a signal with known correlations a
tunable concentration of random outliers or spikes with different amplitude,
and (iii) generating a signal comprised of segments with different properties
-- e.g. different standard deviations or different correlation exponents. We
compare the difference between the scaling results obtained for stationary
correlated signals and correlated signals with these three types of
nonstationarities.

quantum cryptography, better frequency standards or quantum-enhanced

entanglement have revealed very interesting connections with the theory of
positive maps. The capacity to generate entangled states is one of the basic
requirements for building quantum computers. Hence, efficient experimental
methods for detection, verification and estimation of quantum entanglement are
of great practical importance. Here, we propose an experimentally viable,
\emph{direct} detection of quantum entanglement which is efficient and does not
require any \emph{a priori} knowledge about the quantum state. In a particular
case of two entangled qubits it provides an estimation of the amount of
entanglement. We view this method as a new form of quantum computation, namely,
