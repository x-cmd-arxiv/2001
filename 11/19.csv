  a revised power spectrum normalization in fiducial model","Astrophys.J. 579 (2002) 491-499","10.1086/342983",,"astro-ph",,"  Recent observations of high redshift quasar spectra reveal long gaps with
little flux. A small or no detectable flux does not by itself imply the
intergalactic medium (IGM) is neutral. Inferring the average neutral fraction
from the observed absorption requires assumptions about clustering of the IGM,
which the gravitational instability model supplies. Our most stringent
constraint on the neutral fraction at z ~ 6 is derived from the mean Lyman-beta
transmission measured from the z=6.28 SDSS quasar of Becker et al. -- the
neutral hydrogen fraction at mean density has to be larger than 4.7 times
10^{-4}. This is substantially higher than the neutral fraction of ~ 3-5 times
10^{-5} at z = 4.5 - 5.7, suggesting that dramatic changes take place around or
just before z ~ 6, even though current constraints are still consistent with a
fairly ionized IGM at z ~ 6. An interesting alternative method to constrain the
neutral fraction is to consider the probability of having many consecutive
pixels with little flux, which is small unless the neutral fraction is high.
This constraint is slightly weaker than the one obtained from the mean
transmission. We show that while the derived neutral fraction at a given
redshift is sensitive to the power spectrum normalization, the size of the jump
around z ~ 6 is not. We caution that systematic uncertainties include spatial
fluctuations in the ionizing background, and the continuum placement. Tests are
proposed. In particular, the sightline to sightline dispersion in mean
transmission might provide a useful diagnostic. We express the dispersion in
terms of the transmission power spectrum, and develop a method to calculate the
dispersion for spectra that are longer than the typical simulation box.

binary dominated/starburst region in NGC 4736. A compact non-thermal radio

source in Sombrero, while in NGC 4736 its X-ray counterpart is a much fainter

A careful periodic analysis was performed on these stars and a catalogue of

blue and red magnitudes to $K$ band values using 19 oxygen-rich stars. A group
of red short-period stars separated from the Mira sequence has been found on a
(log P, K) diagram. They are located at the short period side of the Mira
sequence consistent with the work of Wood and Sebo (1996). There are two
interpretations for such stars; a difference in pulsation mode or a difference
in chemical composition. We investigated the properties of these stars together
with their colour, amplitude and periodicity. We conclude that they have small
amplitudes and less regular variability. They are likely to be higher mode
pulsators. A large scatter has been also found on the long period side of the
(log P, K) diagram. This is possibly a systematic spread given that the blue
band of our photometric system covers both standard B and V bands and affects
carbon-rich stars.

major contributor to the emitted spectral energy distribution for sub-Eddington
black holes. For example, recent observations of radio-to-X-ray correlations
and broad band spectra of X-ray binaries in the low/hard state can be explained
by a significant synchrotron contribution from jets also to their IR-to-X-ray
spectrum as proposed by Markoff, Falcke, Fender 2001. This model can also
explain state-transitions from low/hard to high/soft states. Relativistic
beaming of the jet X-ray emission could lead to the appearance of seemingly
Super-Eddington X-rays sources in other galaxies. We show that a simple
population synthesis model of X-ray binaries with relativistic beaming can well
explain the currently found distribution of off-nucleus X-ray point sources in
nearby galaxies. Specifically we suggest that the so-called ultra-luminous
X-ray sources (ULXs, also IXOs) could well be relativistically beamed
microblazars. The same model that can be used to explain X-ray binaries also
fits Low-Luminosity AGN (LLAGN) and especially Sgr A* in the Galactic Center.
The recent detection of significant circular polarization in AGN radio cores,
ranging from bright quasars down to low-luminosity AGN like M81*, Sgr A* and
even X-ray binaries, now places additional new constraints on the matter
contents of such jets. The emerging picture are powerful jets with a mix of hot
and cold matter, a net magnetic flux, and a stable magnetic north pole.

is obtained that allowed us, with the help of the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem, to find the spectral densities of the correlation functions of the

the form of a superposition of spectral amplitudes of the expansion with
weights expressed as bilinear combinations of the proper coordinate functions

translational velocity and internal spin of the liquid in one spatial point are
analyzed. They have a sense of local coefficients of the translational and

with the stability of the electroweak symmetry breaking vacuum. If the
supergravity motivated idea of a common scalar mass at some high scale along
with light sleptons is supported by future experiments that may indicate that
we are living in a false vacuum. In contrast SO(10) D-terms, which may arise if
this GUT group breaks down directly to the Standard Model, can lead to this
spectrum with many striking phenomenological predictions, without jeopardizing
vacuum stability.

solitary-wave solutions to the nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation with
periodically modulated and sign-variable dispersion is now well known in
nonlinear optics. Our purpose here is to investigate whether similar structures
exist for other well-known nonlinear wave models. Hence, here we consider as a
basic model the variable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation; this has the
form of a Korteweg-de Vries equation with a periodically varying third-order
dispersion coefficient, that can take both positive and negative values. More
generally, this model may be extended to include fifth-order dispersion. Such
models may describe, for instance, periodically modulated waveguides for long
gravity-capillary waves. We develop an analytical approximation for solitary
waves in the weakly nonlinear case, from which it is possible to obtain a
reduction to a relatively simple integral equation, which is readily solved
numerically. Then, we describe some systematic direct simulations of the full
equation, which use the soliton shape produced by the integral equation as an
initial condition. These simulations reveal regions of stable and unstable
pulsating solitary waves in the corresponding parametric space. Finally, we
consider the effects of fifth-order dispersion.
