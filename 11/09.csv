observational evidence has accumulated that black holes indeed exist in nature.
In this paper, I present a theoretical and numerical (Monte Carlo) fully
relativistic 4-D analysis of Penrose scattering processes (Compton at radii
between the marginally stable, marginally bound orbits and
gamma-gamma-->$e^-e^+$ pair production at the photon orbit) in the ergosphere
of a supermassive Kerr (rotating) black hole. These model calculations
surprisingly reveal that the observed high energies and luminosities of quasars
and other active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the collimated jets about the polar
axis, and the asymmetrical jets (which can be enhanced by relativistic Doppler
beaming effects) all are inherent properties of rotating black holes. From this
analysis, it is shown that the Penrose scattered escaping relativistic
particles exhibit tightly wound coil-like cone distributions (highly collimated
vortical jet distributions) about the polar axis, with helical polar angles of
escape varying from $0.5^o$ to $30^o$ for the highest energy particles. It is
also shown that the gravitomagnetic (GM) field, which causes the dragging of
inertial frames, exerts a force acting on the momentum vectors of the incident
and scattered particles, causing the particle emission to be asymmetrical above
and below the equatorial plane, thus appearing to break the equatorial
reflection symmetry of the Kerr metric. This energy-momentum extraction model
can be applied to any size black hole, irrespective of the mass, and therefore
applies to microquasars as well.

double-lined eclipsing binary YY Gem, a member of the Castor sextuple system
and one of the benchmarks for the comparison between observations and stellar
evolution theory in the lower main-sequence. In addition, we have re-analyzed
existing light curves in several passbands using modern techniques that account
for the conspicuous presence of spots. This, combined with the spectroscopy,
has yielded a very precise determination of the absolute dimensions of the
components, which are virtually identical to each other. We obtain mean values
of M=0.5992+/-0.0047 Mo, R=0.6191+/-0.0057 Ro, and Teff=3820+/-100 K. Both the
mass and the radius determinations are good to better than 1%. A re-analysis of
the Hipparcos transit data for Castor AB has yielded an improved parallax for
the system of 66.90+/-0.63 mas. With this, we have estimated the age (~370 Myr)
and metal abundance ([Fe/H]~0.0) of YY Gem from isochrone fits to Castor A and
B. We have compared the observations of YY Gem with a large number of recent
theoretical calculations, and we show that all models underestimate the radius
by up to 20%, and most overestimate the effective temperature by 150 K or more.
Both of these trends are confirmed by observations of another similar system in
the Hyades cluster (V818 Tau). Consequently, theoretical ages for relatively
low-mass objects such as T Tauri stars derived from the H-R diagram may be
considerably biased. If the radius is used directly as a measure of evolution,
ages could be underestimated by as much as a factor of 10 in this mass regime.
In view of these discrepancies, absolute ages from essentially all current
models for the lower main sequence must be viewed with at least some measure of
skepticism. (abridged)

designed to study galaxy evolution in X-ray selected clusters at intermediate
(z~0.25) and high redshifts (z~0.5). In this paper we give blue galaxy
fractions from eight X-ray selected clusters, drawn from a combined sample of
three X-ray surveys. We find that all the clusters exhibit excess blue galaxy
populations over the numbers observed in local systems, though a large scatter
is present in the results. We find no significant correlation of blue fraction
with redshift at z>0.2 although the large scatter could mask a positive trend.
We also find no systematic trend of blue fraction with X-ray luminosity. We
show that the blue fraction is a function of (a) radius within a cluster, (b)
absolute magnitude and (c) the passbands used to measure the colour. We find
that our blue fractions (f_b) from galaxy colours close to restframe (U-B),
f_b~0.4, are systematically higher than those from restframe (B-V) colours,
f_b~0.2. We conclude this effect is real, may offer a partial explanation of
the widely differing levels of blue fraction found in previous studies and may
have implications for biases in optical samples selected in different bands.
  While the increasing blue fraction with radius can be interpreted as evidence
of cluster infall of field galaxies, the exact physical processes which these
galaxies undergo is unclear. We estimate that, in the cores of the more massive
clusters, galaxies should be experiencing ram--pressure stripping of galactic
gas by the intra--cluster medium. The fact that our low X-ray luminosity
systems show a similar blue fraction as the high luminosity systems, as well as
a significant blue fraction gradient with radius, implies other physical
effects are also important.

interest from X-ray missions. One of the main goals is to determine the radius
of this neutron star. An integral part of the determination is an accurate
parallax. Walter (2001) analyzed Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data and derived
a parallax, pi=16.5+/-2.3 mas. Combining this distance with the angular radius
derived from blackbody fits to observations of RX J1856.5-3754 with ROSAT,
EUVE, HST, Pons et al. (2001) derived an observed radius (""radiation radius""),
R_{infty}= 7 km. This value is smaller than the radii calculated from all

verified our result using a number of different, independent techniques, and
find the result to be robust. Adopting our parallax, the radius of RX
J1856.5-3754 is R_{infty}=15+/-6 km. This radius falls squarely in the range of
radii, 12--16 km, expected from calculations of neutron star structure for
different equations of state. With additional HST observations, the parallax
estimate can be improved to the point by which the inferred radius can
constrain the choice of EOS.

components to galactic field populations. This kinematical imprint on the
stellar distribution function is estimated here by calculating the velocity
distribution function for ensembles of star-clusters distributed as power-law
or log-normal initial cluster mass functions (ICMFs). The resulting stellar
velocity distribution function is non-Gaussian and may be interpreted as being
composed of multiple kinematical sub-populations. The notion that the formation
of star-clusters may add hot kinematical components to a galaxy is applied to

catastrophe in a self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halo. Through gravothermal
evolution driven by collisional relaxation, an SIDM halo will form a massive
inner core whose density and velocity dispersion will increase secularly in
time. Eventually, the inner core arrives at a relativistic radial instability
and undergoes dynamical collapse to a black hole. The initial mass of the black
hole will be $10^{-8}-10^{-6}$ of the total mass of the halo. We show that if
at formation the overdensity in the SIDM halo is not too large, SMBHs in the
observed mass range can form directly in very massive halos following core
collapse. Alternatively, with large overdensities, moderate mass halos undergo
core collapse to form central seed black holes of intermediate mass, and these
holes can then merge and/or accrete to reach the SMBH range. Forming SMBHs by
core collapse in SIDM halos requires no baryons, no prior epoch of star

available for the formation of the solar system and argues for the theory of
the triggered origin of the solar system. According to this scenario, the
formation of our planetary system was initiated by the impact of an
interstellar shock wave on a molecular cloud core. The shock wave originated
from a nearby explosive stellar event and carried with it radioactivities
produced in the stellar source. In addition to triggering the collapse of the
molecular cloud core, the shock wave also deposited some of the freshly
synthesized radioactivities into the collapsing system. The radioactivities
were then incorporated into the first solar system solids, in this manner
leaving a record of the event in the meteoritic material. The viability of the
scenario can be investigated through numerical simulations studying the
processes involved in mixing shock wave material into the collapsing system.
The high-resolution calculations presented here show that injection occurs
through Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, the injection efficiency is
approximately 10%, and temporal and spatial heterogeneities in the abundances
of the radioactivities existed at the time of their arrival in the forming
solar system.

giants. These are based on 7774 equivalent widths and spectral synthesis of 229
additional lines. Hyperfine splitting is taken into account when appropriate.
Our choice of model atmospheres has the most influence on the accuracy of our
abundances. We consider the effect of different model atmospheres on our
results. In addition to the random errors in Teff, log g, and microturbulent
velocity, there are several sources of systematic error. These include using
Teff determined from FeI lines rather than colors, ignoring NLTE effects on the
FeI/FeII ionization balance, using models with solar [alpha/Fe] ratios and
using Kurucz models with overshooting. Of these, only the use of models with
solar [alpha/Fe] ratios had a negligible effect. However, while the absolute
abundances can change by > 0.10 dex, the relative abundances, especially
between closely allied atoms such as the rare earth group, often show only
small (<0.03 dex) changes. We found that some strong lines of FeI, MnI and CrI
consistently gave lower abundances by ~0.2 dex, a number larger than the quoted
errors in the gf values. After considering a model with depth-dependent
microturbulent velocity and a model with hotter temperatures in the upper
layers, we conclude that the latter did a better job of resolving the problem
and agreeing with observational evidence for the structure of stars. The error
analysis includes the effects of correlation of Teff, log g, and microturbulent
velocity errors, which is crucial for certain element ratios, such as [Mg/Fe].
The abundances presented here are being analyzed and discussed in a separate

blueshifted absorption superimposed to it. The narrow central absorption width
and equivalent width are inconsistent with being due only to ISM clouds
described in the literature, which lead us to conclude that it is partially due
to non-LTE processes in the emission line region itself. The emission profile
closely follows Halpha. Its large width in CTTS cannot be due to the Stark

show blueshifted absorptions that are evidence of outflows (terminal velocities

However, several nearby, low-luminosity, mainly S0 galaxies have systematically
low FP distances; we conclude that this is at least partly due to recent star
formation and consequently low mass-to-light ratios. The tie between the
Cepheid-calibrated SBF distances (Mpc) and the far-field calibrated FP
distances (km/s) yields a Hubble constant H_0 = 68 +/- 3 km/s/Mpc, while the
comparison between SBF and the IRAS-reconstructed distances yields H_0 = 74 +/-
2 (internal errorbars). Possible explanations for the marginal inconsistency
include systematic errors in the redshift survey completeness estimates or in
the FP aperture corrections, but at this point, the best estimate of H_0 from
early-type galaxies may be a simple average of the above two estimates. After
revising the SBF distances to be in agreement with the final set of Key Project
Cepheid distances, we conclude H_0 = 73 +/- 4 +/- 11, where the second errorbar
represents the total systematic uncertainty in the distance zero point. We also
discuss the recently introduced ""fluctuation star count"" parameter Nbar as a
less demanding alternative to (V-I) for calibrating SBF distances. The
Nbar-calibrated SBF method is akin to a hybrid SBF-FP distance indicator, and
we find that the use of Nbar actually improves the SBF distances. Further study

Gamma_{-12}<0.02 due to their smaller oscillator strengths, indicating that the
ionizing background in the IGM at z~6 is more than 20 times lower than that at
z~3. Meanwhile, the volume-averaged neutral hydrogen fraction increases from
10^{-5} at z~3 to >10^{-3} at z~6. At this redshift, the mass-averaged neutral
hydrogen fraction is larger than 1%; the mildly overdense regions (delta > 3)

intermediate mass stars with rotation naturally reproduce the occurrence and
amount of primary nitrogen in the early star generations in the Universe. We
identify two reasons why rotating models at low Z produce primary $^{14}$N: 1)
Since the stars lose less angular momentum, they rotate faster. Simultaneously,
they are more compact, thus differential rotation and shear mixing are
stronger. 2) The H--burning shell has a much higher temperature and is thus
closer to the core, which favours mixing between the two.

very weak luminosity dependence of clustering with the more luminous galaxies

erg/s. The relative X-ray and radio properties of the AGN in 1138-262 are

emission is elongated, with a major axis aligned with that of the radio source.
While the X-ray and radio emissions are elongated on similar scales and
position angles, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the radio and
X-ray features in the source. The most likely origin for the extended X-ray
emission in 1138-262 is thermal emission from shocked gas, although we cannot
rule-out a contribution from inverse Compton emission. If the emission is from
hot gas, the gas density is 0.05 cm^{-3} and the gas mass is 2.5x10^{12}

either annihilate (A + A -> 0) or coalesce (A + A -> A) with a q-dependent
probability. We consider all of the walkers in this model to be mutually
infectious. Whenever two walkers meet, they experience mutual contamination.
Walkers which avoid an encounter with another random walker up to time t remain
uninfected. The fraction of uninfected walkers is investigated numerically and
found to decay algebraically, U(t) \sim t^{-\phi(q)}, with a nontrivial
exponent \phi(q). Our study is extended to include the coupled
diffusion-limited reaction A+A -> B, B+B -> A in one dimension with equal
initial densities of A and B particles. We find that the density of walkers
decays in this model as \rho(t) \sim t^{-1/2}. The fraction of sites unvisited
by either an A or a B particle is found to obey a power law, P(t) \sim
t^{-\theta} with \theta \simeq 1.33. We discuss these exponents within the

implementation in neural networks, and in particular close related to the
generalization ability that could be obtained through the learning process. The
measure is computed through the calculus of the number of neighbor examples
that differ in their output value. Pairs of these examples have been previously
shown to be part of the minimum size training set needed to obtain perfect
generalization in feedforward neural networks.
  The main advantage of the proposed measure, in comparison to existing ones,
is the way in which the measure is evaluated, as it can be computed from the
definition of the function itself, independently of its implementation. The
validity of the proposal is analyzed through numerical simulations performed on
different feedforward neural networks architectures, and a good agreement is
obtained between the predicted complexity and the generalization ability for
different classes of functions.
  Also an interesting analogy was found between the proposed complexity measure
and the energy function of ferromagnetic systems, that could be exploited, by
use of the existing results and mathematical tools developed within a
statistical mechanics framework, to explore in a more rigorous way the
properties of Boolean functions when implemented on neural networks.
  We conjecture that the proposed measure could help as an useful tool for
carrying a systematic study of the computational capabilities of neural
networks, essentially by permitting an easy and reliable classification of
Boolean functions. Possible extensions of the work are also discussed.

transition is second order in $d=2$ and first order in $d=3$. For $d=2$ we
predict the transition point quantitatively from properties of the unstretched

slightly below the collapse temperature of the unstretched polymer. We find
very large finite size corrections which would make very difficult the estimate

expanding pipeline computing as a computational process are in the domains of
alternating Turing machines, molecular computing, and E-machines. Expanding

architecture aimed at utilization of implicit parallel structures existing in
algorithms. Such structures appear in various kinds of visualization. Image

this it follows that, although a unitary time-development operator exists, it
is not useful to talk about vacuum states; rather, one should focus attention
on steady state phenomena such as the Hawking radiation. In order to clarify
the approximations used to study this problem I begin by discussing the related
problem of the massless scalar field theory calculated in the presence of a
moving mirror.

been possible to apply lattice methods to this type of physics. Given the
experimental fact of slowly rising hadronic cross sections, we are thus faced
with a fundamental problem comparable to that of confinement but without the
promise of the lattice. During the last years, the experimental side of this
field has largely been driven by the HERA accelerator, which has, naturally,
also influenced recent theoretical work in high-energy QCD. I will therefore
devote the second part of the talk to small-x deep inelastic scattering, in
particular the physics of diffraction, and attempt to describe its impact on

are a unique set of coordinates in which the field theory on the probe takes an
N=2 form and in these coordinates the running coupling of the gauge theory may
be identified. We show that the geometry, when restricted to the moduli space,
takes a very simple form involving only two functions. One is the running gauge
coupling whilst the other parametrizes the scalar operators of the field
theory. The D5 brane distributions, for the full set of solutions in the

running coupling as a function of scalar vevs. We show that the resulting

mechanism yielding the spectra of models with a central charge c<1 including
the unitary and non-unitary minimal series. Taking into account the
half-integer angular momentum sectors - which correspond to chains with an odd
number of sites - in many cases leads to new spinor operators appearing in the
projected systems. These new sectors in the XXZ chain correspond to a new type
of frustration lines in the projected minimal models. The corresponding new
boundary conditions in the Hamiltonian limit are investigated for the Ising
model and the 3-state Potts model and are shown to be related to duality
transformations which are an additional symmetry at their self-dual critical
point. By different ways of projecting systems we find models with the same
central charge sharing the same operator content and modular invariant
partition function which however differ in the distribution of operators into
sectors and hence in the physical meaning of the operators involved. Related to
the projection mechanism in the continuum there are remarkable symmetry
properties of the finite XXZ chain. The observed degeneracies in the energy and

stability index of the inversion problem. This is a number, computed from the
data, which shows how stable the inversion is. If this index is small, then the
inversion provides a set of potentials which differ so little, that practically
one can represent this set by one potential. If this index is larger than some
threshold, then practically one concludes that with the given data the
inversion is unstable and the potential cannot be identified uniquely from the
data. Inversion of the fixed-energy phase shifts for several model potentials
is considered. The results show practical efficiency of the proposed method.
The method is of general nature and is applicable to a very wide variety of the

equations for quasi-geostrophic, baroclinic flow is investigated. Period
doubling cascades and Shil'nikov bifurcations lead to chaos in this model. The
low dimension of the chaotic attractor suggests the possibility to reduce the
model to three degrees of freedom. In a physically comprehensible limit of the
parameters this reduction is done explicitly. The bifurcation diagram of the
reduced model in this limit is compared to the diagram of the six degrees of
freedom model and agrees well. A numerical implementation of the graph
transform is used to approximate the three dimensional invariant manifold away
from the limit case. If the six dimensional model is reduced to a linearisation
of the invariant manifold about the Hadley state, the Lorenz-84 model is found.
Its parameters can then be calculated from the physical parameters of the
quasi-geostrophic model. Bifurcation diagrams at physical and traditional
parameter values are compared and routes to chaos in the Lorenz-84 model are

multiplicity distribution, the transverse momentum (pT), and pseudorapidity
(eta) distributions for charged hadrons (h-, h+) are presented. Results on
identified pi- transverse mass (mT) and rapidity (y) distributions are also
discussed. The data were taken with the STAR detector at BNL-RHIC with emphasis
on particles near mid-rapidity. We find that the h- multiplicity at
mid-rapidity for the 5% most central interactions is dN/d eta = 280 +/- 1 +/-
20, an increase per participant of 38% relative to p-pbar collisions at similar
energy. The mean transverse momentum is 0.508 +/- 0.012 GeV/c and is larger
than in Pb+Pb collisions at lower energies. The scaling of the h- yield per
participant nucleon pair, obtained via a ratio of Au+Au to p-pbar pT
distributions, is a strong function of pT. The pseudorapidity distribution is
almost constant within |eta|<1. The pi- rapidity distribution is also flat
around mid-rapidity in the region y<0.8, with a yield of pions for central
collisions of dN/dy = 287 +/- 1 +/- 21. However, the slope of the mT
distributions is not the same for different rapidity bins, suggesting that
boost-invariance is not fully achieved in the collisions.

solutions to the Schr\UNICODE{0xf6}dinger equation are known in terms of

characterized by three parameters: the height of the barrier, the distance of
the barrier from the origin of the radial variable $r,$ and a diffuseness
parameter. The wave function, defined in the interval $0\leq r<\infty ,$ is
required to vanish at $r=0,$ and hence represents a radial partial wave for
zero angular momentum. The vanishing at $r=0$ requires a special combination of
hypergeometric functions, and can lead to resonances for incident energies
which occur below the top of the barrier. Numerical values for the analytical
phase shifts are presented in and outside the resonant regions, and the

experiments requires that the power output from all the beams match within 8%
over their entire 20-nanosecond waveform. The scope of NIF beam diagnostics
systems necessary to accomplish this task is unprecedented for laser
facilities. Each beam line contains 110 major optical components distributed
over a 510 meter path, and diagnostic tolerances for beam measurement are
demanding. Total laser pulse energy is measured with 2.8% precision, and the
inter-beam temporal variation of pulse power is measured with 4% precision.
These measurement goals are achieved through use of approximately 160 sensor
packages that measure the energy at five locations and power at 3 locations
along each beamline using 335 photodiodes, 215 calorimeters and 36 digitizers.
Successful operation of such a system requires a high level of automation of
the widely distributed sensors. Computer control systems provide the basis for
operating the shot diagnostics with repeatable accuracy, assisted by operators
who oversee system activities and setup, respond to performance exceptions, and

while drawing delicate interference patterns such as the supernumerary arcs of
the rainbow. Black holes cause wave singularities. Waves oscillate with
infinitely small wave lengths at the event horizon where time stands still. The
quantum nature of light avoids this higher level of catastrophic behaviour
while producing a quantum phenomenon known as Hawking radiation. As this letter
describes, light brought to a standstill in laboratory experiments can suffer a
similar wave singularity caused by a parabolic profile of the group velocity.
In turn, the quantum vacuum is forced to create photon pairs with a
characteristic spectrum. The idea may initiate a theory of quantum
catastrophes, in addition to classical catastrophe theory, and the proposed
experiment may lead to the first direct observation of a phenomenon related to

generation light source. There are various issues in orbit feedback system
should be addressed to achieve ultimate performance. The orbit feedback system
in SRRC is upgraded recently to satisfy the requirement of demanding users.
Based upon operational experiences of the last few years, new system was
designed with more robustness and flexibility. Performance analysis tools are
also developed to monitor system performance. Algorithms for feedback control,
data acquisition and analysis are described and measurement is also presented.

the function and test results. The GAC has two GPIB connectors (upper and lower
ports). The upper port has a GPIB primary address, and connected to a GPIB
system controller. The lower port acts as a GPIB controller of the lower side
GPIB line. The GPIB system controller can access the lower side GPIB devices
through the GAC by using an extended two-byte address function. The two-byte
address (primary + secondary) is shown in the combination of the GAC address
and the address of the lower side device. The GAC converts the secondary
address into the primary address of the lower side GPIB device. By using 30
GACs, the GPIB system controller can access 930 devices assigned only primary
address.

University of California Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) is a
192-beam, 1.8-megajoule, 500-terawatt, 351-nm laser for inertial confinement
fusion (ICF) and high-energy-density experimental studies. NIF is being built
by the Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Agency (NNSA) to
provide an experimental test bed for the U.S. Stockpile Stewardship Program to
ensure the country's nuclear deterrent without underground nuclear testing. The
experimental program will encompass a wide range of physical phenomena from
fusion energy production to materials science. Of the roughly 700 shots
available per year, about 10% will be dedicated to basic science research.
Laser hardware is modularized into line replaceable units (LRUs) such as
deformable mirrors, amplifiers, and multi-function sensor packages that are
operated by a distributed computer control system of nearly 60,000 control
points. The supervisory control room presents facility-wide status and
orchestrates experiments using operating parameters predicted by physics
models. A network of several hundred front-end processors (FEPs) implements
device control. The object-oriented software system is implemented in the Ada
and Java languages and emphasizes CORBA distribution of reusable software
objects. NIF is currently scheduled to provide first light in 2004 and will be
completed in 2008.

Aharonov-Bohm flux intersecting the plane at the origin on the background of a
homogeneous magnetic field. A standard technique based on self-adjoint
extensions yields a four-parameter family of boundary conditions; other two
parameters of the model are the Aharonov-Bohm flux and the homogeneous magnetic
field. The generalised boundary conditions may be regarded as a combination of
the Aharonov-Bohm effect with a point interaction. Spectral properties of the
derived Hamiltonians are studied in detail.

mixing process, there is more flexibility in the choices of illumination and
detection wavelengths and in the placement of object(s) to be imaged. Moreover,
this source is entangled, a fact that allows for imaging configurations and
capabilities that cannot be achieved using classical sources of light. In this
paper we examine a number of imaging and image-processing configurations that
can be realized using this source. The formalism that we utilize facilitates
the determination of the dependence of imaging resolution on the physical
parameters of the optical arrangement.
