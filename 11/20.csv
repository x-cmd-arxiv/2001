velocity difference structure functions up to the fifth order. In particular,
the velocity power spectrum in the inertial range is found to be close to E(k)

results agree well with the Kolmogorov--Burgers analytical model suggested for
supersonic turbulence in [astro-ph/0108300]. We then generalize the model to
more realistic, fractal structure of molecular clouds, and show that depending
on the fractal dimension of a given molecular cloud, the theoretical value for

corresponding window for the velocity difference scaling exponent is [0.42 ...

because of the larger companion and stronger magnetic field of the primary.
Electrical power is an alternative stellar luminosity source, following on from

to account for the observed X-ray luminosity of the 9.5-min binary RX J1914+24,

the modelling, such as gas cooling and heating, can lead to a factor of two
variations in the normalization and are thus not very reliable. Here we use
instead an empirical M_{500}-T relation derived from X-ray mass determinations
to calibrate the method. We use results from dark matter simulations to relate
the virial mass function to the mass function at observed M_{500}. We find that
the best fitted value in flat models is sigma_8=(0.7 \pm 0.06)
(\Omega_m/0.35)^{-0.44}(\Gamma/0.2)^{0.08}, where only the statistical error is
quoted. This is significantly lower than previously obtained values from the
local cluster abundance. This lower value for sigma_8 is in a better agreement
with cosmic microwave background and large scale structure constraints and
helps alleviate small scale problems of CDM models. Presently the systematic
uncertainties in the mass determination are still large, but ultimately this
method should provide a more reliable way to normalize the M-T relation. This
can be achieved by obtaining a larger sample of well measured cluster masses
out to a significant fraction of virial radius with BeppoSAX, Chandra and

represents an HB that is redder than what can be attributed solely to Cetus'
metal abundance. As such, Cetus suffers from the `second parameter effect' in
which another parameter besides metallicity is controlling the HB morphology.
If we adopt the conventional `age hypothesis' explanation for the second

been designed to study structure formation in the universe with high spatial
resolution. The code is based on Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) technique, with
a tree based data structure allowing recursive grid refinements on a
cell-by-cell basis. The N-body solver is very similar to the one developed for
the ART code (Kravtsov et al. 97), with minor differences in the exact
implementation. The hydrodynamical solver is based on a second-order Godunov
method, a modern shock-capturing scheme known to compute accurately the thermal
history of the fluid component. The accuracy of the code is carefully estimated
using various test cases, from pure gas dynamical tests to cosmological ones.
The specific refinement strategy used in cosmological simulations is described,
and potential spurious effects associated to shock waves propagation in the
resulting AMR grid are discussed and found to be negligible. Results obtained
in a large N-body and hydrodynamical simulation of structure formation in a low
density LCDM universe are finally reported, with 256^3 particles and 4.1 10^7
cells in the AMR grid, reaching a formal resolution of 8192^3. A convergence
analysis of different quantities, such as dark matter density power spectrum,
gas pressure power spectrum and individual haloes temperature profiles, shows
that numerical results are converging down to the actual resolution limit of
the code, and are well reproduced by recent analytical predictions in the

hot, bright X-ray emission, located approximately 20 arcsec to the southeast of
the main X-ray peak, at a position consistent with the region of enhanced
Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect reported by Komatsu et al. (2001). We suggest that
this region contains shocked gas resulting from a recent subcluster merger
event. Excluding the data for the southeast quadrant, the cluster appears
relatively relaxed. The X-ray gas temperature rises from kT~6 keV within the
central 25 h_50^{-1} kpc radius to a mean value of ~16 keV between 0.1-0.5
h_50^{-1} Mpc. The mass profile for the relaxed regions of the cluster,
determined under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, can be
parameterized by a Navarro, Frenk & White (1997) model with a scale radius
r_s~0.4 h_50^{-1} Mpc and a concentration parameter c~6. The best-fit Chandra
mass model is in good agreement with independent measurements from weak

clump centred on the second brightest galaxy. We argue that this galaxy is

of extremely different compositions including pure leptonic and baryonic
plasmas. Our work is based on two-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic
simulations of the long-term evolution of powerful extragalactic jets
propagating into a homogeneous environment. The equation of state used in the
simulations accounts for an arbitrary mixture of electrons, protons and
electron-positron pairs. Using the hydrodynamic models we have also computed
synthetic radio maps and the thermal Bremsstrahlung X-ray emission from their
cavities.
  Although there is a difference of about three orders of magnitude in the
temperatures of the cavities inflated by the simulated jets, we find that both
the morphology and the dynamic behaviour are almost independent on the assumed
composition of the jets. Their evolution proceeds in two distinct epochs.
During the first one multidimensional effects are unimportant and the jets
propagate ballistically. The second epoch starts when the first larger vortices
are produced near the jet head causing the beam cross section to increase and
the jet to decelerate. The evolution of the cocoon and cavity is in agreement
with a simple theoretical model. The beam velocities are relativistic ($\Gamma
\simeq 4$) at kiloparsec scales supporting the idea that the X-ray emission of
several extragalactic jets may be due to relativistically boosted CMB photons.
The radio emission of all models is dominated by the contribution of the hot
spots. All models exhibit a depression in the X-rays surface brightness of the
cavity interior in agreement with recent observations.

ejecta density profile, at an ejecta velocity $\sim 3000 \kms $. These results
apply to moderately large clumps; smaller clumps would require an even larger
density contrast. Clumps can create ring structure in the shell of the Vela
remnant and we investigate the possibility that RX J0852--4622, an apparent
supernova remnant superposed on Vela, is actually part of the Vela shell. Radio
observations support this picture, but the possible presence of a compact
object argues against it. The Ni bubble effect or compression in a pulsar wind
nebula are possible mechanisms to produce the clumping.

Poynting-Robertson drag, and velocity evolution from dynamical friction and
viscous stirring. We assume that the stellar encounter increases planetesimal
velocities to the shattering velocity, initiating a collisional cascade in the
disk. During the early stages of our calculations, erosive collisions damp
particle velocities and produce substantial amounts of dust. For a wide range
of initial conditions and input parameters, the time evolution of the dust
luminosity follows a simple relation, L_d/L_{\star} = L_0 / [alpha +
(t/t_d)^{beta}]. The maximum dust luminosity L_0 and the damping time t_d
depend on the disk mass, with L_0 proportional to M_d and t_d proportional to
M_d^{-1}. For disks with dust masses of 1% to 100% of the `minimum mass solar
nebula' (1--100 earth masses at 30--150 AU), our calculations yield t_d approx
1--10 Myr, alpha approx 1--2, beta = 1, and dust luminosities similar to the
range observed in known `debris disk' systems, L_0 approx 10^{-3} to 10^{-5}.
Less massive disks produce smaller dust luminosities and damp on longer
timescales. Because encounters with field stars are rare, these results imply
that moderately close stellar flybys cannot explain collisional cascades in
debris disk systems with stellar ages of 100 Myr or longer.

calculations using basis sets centred on the nuclei have enabled the
determination of the charge and spin density distribution in the CuO2-plane.
The contributions to the electric field gradients and the magnetic hyperfine

regions in an attempt to find a correlation with the most commonly used
point-ion model, the Sternheimer equation which depends on the two parameters R
and gamma. Our most optimistic objective was to find expressions for these

problem seems to stem from the covalently bonded nature of the CuO2-planes in
these structures which severely questions using the Sternheimer equation for
such crystals, since its derivation is heavily reliant on the application of
perturbation theory to predominantly ionic structures. Furthermore it is shown

obtain two approximation algorithms with worst-case approximation ratios of 1/2
and 1/3 for planar and general secondary structures,respectively. For an RNA
sequence of $n$ bases, the approximation algorithm for planar secondary
structures runs in $O(n^3)$ time while that for the general case runs in linear
time. Furthermore, we prove that allowing pseudoknots makes it NP-hard to
maximize the number of stacking pairs in a planar secondary structure. This
result is in contrast with the recent NP-hard results on psuedoknots which are

theory around some non-trivial background configuration. This observation
explains the ubiquitous nature of the ``analog models'' for general relativity
that have recently been developed based on condensed matter physics. In the
simple (single scalar field) situation analyzed in our previous paper, there is
a single unique effective metric; more complicated situations can lead to
bi-metric and multi-metric theories. In the present paper we will investigate
the conditions required to keep the situation under control and compatible with
experiment -- either by enforcing a unique effective metric (as would be
required to be strictly compatible with the Einstein Equivalence Principle), or
at the worst by arranging things so that there are multiple metrics that are
all ``close'' to each other (in order to be compatible with the {\Eotvos}
experiment). The algebraically most general situation leads to a physical model
whose mathematical description requires an extension of the usual notion of
Finsler geometry to a Lorentzian-signature pseudo-Finsler geometry; while this
is possibly of some interest in its own right, this particular case does not
seem to be immediately relevant for either particle physics or gravitation. The
key result is that wide classes of theories lend themselves to an effective
metric description. This observation provides further evidence that the notion
of ``analog gravity'' is rather generic.

making use of the basic results of the standard linear structure-formation

gravity is considered from the viewpoint of it's ""best approximation"" to the
already known formal continuum general relativity (GR) measure. A rigorous
formulation may consist in comparing functional Fourier transforms of the
measures, i.e. characteristic or generating functionals, and requiring these to
coincide on some dense set in the functional space. The possibility for such
set to exist is due to the Regge manifold being a particular case of general
Riemannian one (Regge calculus is a minisuperspace theory). The two versions of
the measure are obtained depending on what metric tensor, covariant or
contravariant one, is taken as fundamental field variable. The closed
expressions for the measure are obtained in the two simple cases of Regge
manifold. These turn out to be quite reasonable one of them indicating that
appropriately defined continuum limit of the Regge measure would reproduce the
original continuum GR measure.

perturbations are generated by strong variable gravitational field of the early
Universe. The generating mechanism is the superadiabatic (parametric)
amplification of the zero-point quantum oscillations. The generated fields have
specific statistical properties of squeezed vacuum quantum states.
Macroscopically, squeezing manifests itself in a non-stationary character of
variances and correlation functions of the fields, the periodic structures of
the metric power spectra, and, as a consequence, in oscillatory behavior of the
higher order multipoles C_l of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy. We
start with the gravitational wave background and then apply the theory to
primordial density perturbations. We derive an analytical formula for the
positions of peaks and dips in the angular power spectrum l(l+1)C_l as a
function of l. This formula shows that the values of l at the peak positions
are ordered in the proportion 1:3:5:..., whereas at the dips they are ordered
as 1:2:3:.... We compare the derived positions with the actually observed
features, and find them to be in reasonably good agreement. It appears that the
observed structure is better described by our analytical formula based on the
(squeezed) metric perturbations associated with the primordial density
perturbations, rather than by the acoustic peaks reflecting the existence of
plasma sound waves at the last scattering surface. We formulate a forecast for
other features in the angular power spectrum, that may be detected by the
advanced observational missions, such as MAP and PLANCK. We tentatively
conclude that the observed structure is a macroscopic manifestation of
squeezing in the primordial metric perturbations.

factorized, in which the nonperturbative effect related to the heavy meson can
be characterized by matrix elements defined in the heavy quark effective
theory. Using this factorization, predictions for the full spin density matrix

one coefficient representing the nonperturbative effect. Predictions for spin-1
heavy meson are compared with experiment performed at $e^+e^-$ colliders in the
energy range from $\sqrt{s}=10.5$GeV to $\sqrt{s}=91$GeV, a complete agreement
is found for $D^*$- and $B^*$-meson. For $D^{**}$ meson, our prediction suffers
a large correction, as indicated by experimental data. There exists another
approach by taking heavy mesons as bound systems, in which the total angular
momentum of the light degrees of freedom is 1/2 and 3/2 for spin-1 and spin-2

obtained. However, there are distinct differences in the predictions from the

complexes studied earlier by Culler and Vogtmann and by Penner, have a rich
algebraic structure. We define a Lie bracket and cobracket on graph complexes,
and in fact show that they are Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras, and therefore
Gerstenhaber algebras. We also find natural subcomplexes on which the bracket
and cobracket are compatible as a Lie bialgebra.
  Kontsevich's graph complex construction was generalized to the context of
operads by Ginzburg and Kapranov, with later generalizations by
Getzler-Kapranov and Markl. In [CoV], we show that Kontsevich's results in fact
extend to general cyclic operads. For some operads, including the examples
associated to moduli space and outer automorphism groups of free groups, the
subcomplex on which we have a Lie bi-algebra structure is quasi-isomorphic to
the entire connected graph complex. In the present paper we show that all of
the new algebraic operations canonically vanish when the homology functor is
applied, and we expect that the resulting constraints will be useful in
studying the homology of the mapping class group, finite type manifold
invariants and the homology of Out(F_n).

  6.20 and one reference included","J. Pure Appl. Alg. 180, 81-157 (2003)",,,"math.CT math.OA",,"  We consider certain categorical structures that are implicit in subfactor
theory. Making the connection between subfactor theory (at finite index) and
category theory explicit sheds light on both subjects. Furthermore, it allows
various generalizations of these structures, e.g. to arbitrary ground fields,
and the proof of new results about topological invariants in three dimensions.
The central notion is that of a Frobenius algebra in a tensor category A, which
reduces to the classical notion if A=F-Vect, where F is a field. An object X in
A with two-sided dual X^ gives rise to a Frobenius algebra in A, and under weak
additional conditions we prove a converse: There exists a bicategory E with
Obj(E)={X,Y} such that End_E(X,X) is equivalent to A and such that there are J:
Y->X, J^: X->Y producing the given Frobenius algebra. Many properties
(additivity, sphericity, semisimplicity,...) of A carry over to E. We define
weak monoidal Morita equivalence (wMe) of tensor categories and establish a
correspondence between Frobenius algebras in A and tensor categories B wMe A.
While considerably weaker than equivalence of tensor categories, weak monoidal
Morita equivalence of A and B implies (for A,B semisimple and spherical or
*-categories) that A and B have the same dimension, braided equivalent `center'
(quantum double) and define the same state sum invariants of closed oriented
3-manifolds as defined by Barrett and Westbury. If H is a finite dimensional
semisimple and cosemisimple Hopf algebra then H-mod and H^-mod are wMe. The
present formalism permits a fairly complete analysis of the quantum double of a
semisimple spherical category, which is the subject of the companion paper
math.CT/0111205.

semisimple and spherical over an algebraically closed field F. In the latter

this conjecture with mere operator amenability replaced by operator
C-amenability for some constant C < 5. In the process, we obtain a new
decomposition of B(G), which can be interpreted as the non-commutative
counterpart of the decomposition of M(G) into the discrete and the continuous
measures. We further introduce a variant of operator amenability - called
operator Connes-amenability - which also takes the dual space structure on B(G)
and B_r(G) into account. We show that B_r(G) is operator Connes-amenable if and

equation systems. By analogy with the Fasshauer's Hermite interpolation, we
recently developed the symmetric BKM and boundary particle methods (BPM), where
the latter is based on the multiple reciprocity principle. The resulting
interpolation matrix of them is always symmetric irrespective of boundary
geometry and conditions. Furthermore, the proposed direct BKM and BPM apply the
practical physical variables rather than expansion coefficients and become very
competitive alternative to the boundary element method. On the other hand, by
using the Green integral we derive a new domain-type symmetrical RBF scheme
called as the modified Kansa method (MKM), which differs from the Fasshaure's
scheme in that the MKM discretizes both governing equation and boundary
conditions on the same boundary nodes. Therefore, the MKM significantly reduces
calculation errors at nodes adjacent to boundary with explicit mathematical
basis. Experimenting these novel RBF schemes with 2D and 3D Laplace, Helmholtz,
and convection-diffusion problems will be subject of this study. In addition,
the nonsingular high-order fundamental or general solution will be employed as

both sides by a medium with larger refraction index, is studied in the case in
which an electromagnetic plane wave impinges into the gap with an incidence
angle larger than the critical angle. In this condition (total reflection), the
gap acts as a classically forbidden region and behaves like a tunnel. The field
inside the forbidden gap consists of two evanescent waves, each one having its
wavefronts normal to the interface. In the present paper we study the total
field derived as a superposition of two such evanescent waves, its wavefronts,
and the directions of propagation of both phase and energy.

arise when mistrustful parties need to generate, process or exchange

can be founded on a single protocol, oblivious transfer, from which general
secure multi-party computations can be built.
  The scope of mistrustful quantum cryptography is limited by no-go theorems,
which rule out, inter alia, unconditionally secure quantum protocols for
oblivious transfer or general secure two-party computations. These theorems
apply even to protocols which take relativistic signalling constraints into
account. The best that can be hoped for, in general, are quantum protocols
computationally secure against quantum attack. I describe here a method for
building a classically certified bit commitment, and hence every other
mistrustful cryptographic task, from a secure coin tossing protocol. No
security proof is attempted, but I sketch reasons why these protocols might
resist quantum computational attack.

exist non-relativistic quantum bit string commitment protocols, with security

bits to $B$ so that $A$'s probability of successfully cheating when revealing
any bit and $B$'s probability of extracting more than $N'=N-M$ bits of
information about the $N$ bit string before revelation are both less than
$\epsilon$. With a slightly weakened but still restrictive definition of
security against $A$, $N$ can be taken to be $O(\exp (C N'))$ for a positive
constant $C$. I briefly discuss possible applications.
