X-ray spectrum can be fitted by a two-component model. We interpret the soft
component as blackbody emission from a heated spot on the neutron star, and the
hard component as coming from Comptonization in plasma heated by the accretion
shock as the material collimated by the magnetic field impacts onto the neutron
star surface. The hotspot is probably the source of seed photons for
Comptonization. The hard component illuminates the disc, giving rise to a
reflected spectrum. The inferred evolution of the inner radius is not
consistent with the magnetic field truncating the disc. Instead it seems more
likely that the inner disc radius is set by some much longer time-scale
process, most probably connected to the overall evolution of the accretion
disc. This disc truncation mechanism would then have to be generic in all low
mass accretion rate flows both in disc accreting neutron stars and black hole
systems. The phase resolved spectra show clearly that the blackbody and hard
Comptonized spectra pulse independently. This obviously gives an energy
dependent phase lag. Full general relativistic effects are not required to
explain this. We do not detect Compton reflection from the neutron star
surface, though we predict that it should be present in the X-ray spectrum.
This would give an unambiguous observational measure of M/R if there is any
iron on the neutron star surface which is not completely ionized.

understanding of the degree of primordial mass segregation in star clusters.
This is crucial for the interpretation of observational luminosity functions
(LFs) in terms of the initial mass function (IMF), and for constraining the
universality of the IMF.
  We present evidence for strong luminosity segregation in both clusters. The
LF slopes steepen with cluster radius; in both NGC 1805 and NGC 1818 the LF
slopes reach a stable level well beyond the clusters' core or half-light radii.
In addition, the brightest cluster stars are strongly concentrated within the
inner ~4 R_hl.
  The global cluster LF, although strongly nonlinear, is fairly well
approximated by the core or half-light LF; the (annular) LFs at these radii are
dominated by the segregated high-luminosity stars, however.
  We present tentative evidence for the presence of an excess number of bright
stars surrounding NGC 1818, for which we argue that they are most likely
massive stars that have been collisionally ejected from the cluster core. We
therefore suggest that the cores of massive young stars clusters undergo
significant dynamical evolution, even on time-scales as short as ~25 Myr.

  Both the radial dependence of the mass function (MF) and the dependence of
the cluster core radii on mass indicate clear mass segregation in both clusters
at radii r <= 20-30'', for masses in excess of ~1.6-2.5 Msun. This result does
not depend on the mass range used to fit the slopes or the metallicity assumed.
It is clear that the cluster MFs, at any radius, are not simple power laws.
  The global and the annular MFs near the core radii appear to be characterised
by similar slopes in the mass range (-0.15 <= log m/Msun <= 0.85), the MFs
beyond r >= 30'' have significantly steeper slopes.
  We estimate that while the NGC 1818 cluster core is between ~5 and ~30
crossing times old, the core of NGC 1805 is likely $\lesssim 3-4$ crossing
times old. However, since strong mass segregation is observed out to ~6 Rcore
and ~3 Rcore in NGC 1805 and NGC 1818, respectively, it is most likely that
significant primordial mass segregation was present in both clusters,
particularly in NGC 1805.

instability for axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric perturbations is shown to
have the same dependence of the (instantaneous) growth rate on the wavenumber

transient. However, a meaningful dependence of the Rayleigh quotient on the

Solar neighborhood. The observed sources were chosen to cover a wide range of
physical characteristics - spectral type, rotation, age, binarity, and X-ray
and H\alpha activity - to determine the role of these properties in the
production of radio emission, and hence magnetic fields. Three of the twelve
sources, TVLM513-46546, 2MASS J0036159+182110, and BRI0021-0214, were observed
to flare and also exhibit persistent emission, indicating that magnetic
activity is not quenched at the bottom of the main sequence. The radio emission
extends to spectral type L3.5, and there is no apparent decrease in the ratio
of flaring luminosities to bolometric luminosities between M8-L3.5. Moreover,
contrary to the significant drop in persistent H\alpha activity beyond spectral
type M7, the persistent radio activity appears to steadily increase between
M3-L3.5. Similarly, the radio emission from BRI0021-0214 violates the
phenomenological relations between the radio and X-ray luminosities of
coronally active stars, hinting that radio and X-ray activity are also
uncorrelated at the bottom of the main sequence. The radio active sources that
have measured rotational velocities are rapid rotators, Vsin(i)>30 km/sec,
while the upper limits on radio activity in slowly-rotating late M dwarfs
(Vsin(i)<10 km/sec) are lower than these detections. These observations provide
tantalizing evidence that rapidly-rotating late M and L dwarfs are more likely
to be radio active. This possible correlation is puzzling given that the
observed radio emission requires sustained magnetic fields of 10-1000 G and
densities of 10^12 cm^-3, indicating that the active sources should have slowed
down considerably due to magnetic braking.

tracer of cold (10 K) gas at the center of LIRGs, as it often is in the disk of
the Milky Way. Instead, the HNC abundance may remain substantial, despite high
gas temperatures, because the emission is emerging from regions where the HCN

reactions which are not strongly dependent on kinetic temperature. We find five
galaxies (four AGNs and one starburst) where the I(HCN)/I(HNC) intensity ratio

emission is on average a factor of two fainter than HCN, but the variation is

increasing IR luminosity. One galaxy, NGC3690, has a CN luminosity twice that

initial density profiles (scale or not scale free) and no assumption of
self-similar evolution is required. The realistic initial overdensity profiles
used are derived by a CDM power spectrum. We show that the amount of angular
momentum and the initial overdensity profile affect the slope of the final
density profile at the inner regions. Thus, a larger amount of angular momentum
or shallower initial overdensity profiles lead to shallower final density
profiles at the inner regions. On the other hand, the slope at the outer
regions is not affected by the amount of angular momentum and has an almost
constant value equal to that predicted in the radial collapse case.

defects and disorder on the magnetic properties of these materials, ii)
predicting properties of new materials and iii) providing parameters, often not

studies are facilitated by recent advances in numerical implementations of
density functional theory, which make the study of systems with a very large

flat, noninteracting density of states and with a density of states that
includes Coulomb interactions. In the latter case, the density of states has a
Coulomb gap that fills in with increasing temperature. For a large Coulomb gap
width, this density of states gives a dc conductivity with a hopping exponent
of approximately 0.75 which has been observed in recent experiments. For a
small Coulomb gap width, the hopping exponent approximately 0.5.

range of temperature investigated covers both the liquid, supercooled and
glassy states, while the shear rate covers both the linear and nonlinear
regimes of rheology. The results can be interpreted in the context of a
nonequilibrium, schematic mode-coupling theory developed recently, which makes
the theory applicable to a wide range of soft glassy materials. The behavior of
the viscosity is first investigated. In the nonlinear regime, strong
shear-thinning is obtained. Scaling properties of the intermediate scattering
functions are studied. Standard `mode-coupling properties' of factorization and
time-superposition hold in this nonequilibrium situation. The
fluctuation-dissipation relation is violated in the shear flow in a way very
similar to that predicted theoretically, allowing for the definition of an
effective temperature Teff for the slow modes of the fluid. Temperature and
shear rate dependencies of Teff are studied using density fluctuations as an
observable. The observable dependence of Teff is also investigated. Many
different observables are found to lead to the same value of Teff, suggesting
several experimental procedures to access Teff. It is proposed that tracer
particle of large mass may play the role of an `effective thermometer'. When
the Einstein frequency of the tracers becomes smaller than the inverse
relaxation time of the fluid, a nonequilibrium equipartition theorem holds.
This last result gives strong support to the thermodynamic interpretation of
Teff and makes it experimentally accessible in a very direct way.

valence-band holes and $S=5/2$ Mn local moments. We discuss physical
predictions based on a mean-field treatment of the disorder-free model and
demonstrate that it successfully describes a number of non-trivial properties
of (Ga,Mn)As and (In,Mn)As ferromagnets. Study of collective excitations of
these ferromagnets shows that the simple mean-field-theory is reasonably
reliable for typical parameters of current samples but must fail at large
carrier densities and also in the limit of very strong exchange coupling.
Finally we discuss the results of Monte Carlo calculations that describe the
effect of collective fluctuations of Mn moment orientations. The method can
deal with some of the complications and additional physics, including the
possibility of non-collinear ground states, that enters when disorder is added
to the theoretical model.

volumes and couplings are chosen to ensure that the lattice momenta are all
perturbative. Twisted boundary conditions are used to eliminate the effects of
lattice zero modes and to suppress nonperturbative finite-volume effects due to
Z(3) phases. Simulations of the Wilson gluon action are done with both periodic
and twisted boundary conditions, and over a wide range of lattice volumes (from
$3^4$ to $16^4$) and couplings (from $\beta \approx 9$ to $\beta \approx 60$).
A high precision comparison is made between the simulation data and results
from finite-volume lattice perturbation theory. The Monte Carlo results are
shown to be in excellent agreement with perturbation theory through second
order. New results for third-order coefficients for a number of Wilson loops
and the static-quark self-energy are reported.

which shares many of the virtues of inflation. The very earliest semiclassical
era of the universe is dominated by a dense gas of black holes, with equation
of state $p=\rho$. Fluctuations lead to an instability to a phase with a dilute
gas of black holes, which later decays via Hawking radiation to a radiation
dominated universe. The quantum fluctuations of the initial state give rise to
a scale invariant spectrum of density perturbations, for a range of scales. We
point out a problem, that appears to prevent the range of scales predicted by
the model from coinciding with the range where such a spectrum has been
observed. We speculate that this may be related to our field theoretic
treatment of fluctuations in the highly holographic $p=\rho$ background. The
monopole problem is solved in a manner completely different from inflationary
models, and a relic density of highly charged extremal black monopoles is
predicted. We discuss the nature of the entropy and flatness problems in our
model.

orbital, the periodic table of elementary particles is derived from the two
sets of seven orbitals: principal dimensional orbital and auxiliary dimensional
orbital. (Seven orbitals come indirectly from the seven extra dimensions in
eleven-dimensional space-time.) Principal dimensional orbital derived from
varying space-time dimension, varying speed of light, and varying supersymmetry
explains gauge bosons and low-mass leptons. Auxiliary dimensional orbital
derived from principal dimensional orbital accounts for high-mass leptons and
individual quarks. For hadrons as the composites of individual quarks, hadronic
dimensional orbital derived from auxiliary dimensional orbital is responsible.
These three sets of seven orbitals explain all elementary particles and
hadrons. QCD, essentially, describes the different occupations of quarks in the
three sets of seven orbitals at different temperatures. The periodic table of
elementary particles and the compositions of hadrons relate to the Barut lepton
mass formula, the Polazzi mass formula for stable hadrons, and the
MacGregor-Akers constituent quark model. The calculated masses for elementary

nonlinear analysis using equations of Zhang and Vinals (1997, J. Fluid Mech.

perform a perturbation expansion through fourth order which yields analytical
expressions for onset parameters and the cubic bifurcation coefficient that
determines wave amplitude as a function of forcing near onset. For stronger
damping and forcing we numerically compute these same parameters, as well as
the cubic cross-coupling coefficient for competing waves travelling at an angle
theta relative to each other. The resonance effects predicted by symmetry are
borne out in the perturbation results for one spatial dimension, and are
supported by the numerical results in two dimensions. The difference frequency

in the micro canonical ensemble whereas the canonical heat capacity exhibits an

process. The cells are coupled by assuming that the the input of the sensor
cell is proportional to the output of the donor cell. As one varies the
frequency of calcium oscillations of the donor cell, the sensor cell passes
through a sequence of N:M phase locked regimes and exhibits a ""Devil's

in pulsatile stimulation of single cells. We also study a stochastic version of
the coupled two cell model. We find that phase locking holds for realistic

acoustically interacting bubbles have been verified numerically. The theory
provided by Ida [Phys. Lett. A 297 (2002) 210] predicted the existence of three
transition frequencies per bubble, each of which has the phase difference of
$\pi /2$ between a bubble's pulsation and the external sound field, while
previous theories predicted only two natural frequencies which cause such phase
shifts. Namely, two of the three transition frequencies correspond to the
natural frequencies, while the remaining does not. In a subsequent paper [M.
Ida, Phys. Rev. E 67 (2003) 056617], it was shown theoretically that transition
frequencies other than the natural frequencies may cause the sign reversal of
the secondary Bjerknes force acting between pulsating bubbles. In the present
study, we employ a direct numerical simulation technique that uses the
compressible Navier-Stokes equations with a surface-tension term as the
governing equations to investigate the transition frequencies of two coupled
bubbles by observing their pulsation amplitudes and directions of translational
motion, both of which change as the driving frequency changes. The numerical
results reproduce the recent theoretical predictions, validating the existence
of the transition frequencies not corresponding to the natural frequency.

technique in which the axial symmetry condition is relaxed by means of a
