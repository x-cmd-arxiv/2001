thick magnetized disk, including the presence of a spiral arm. The $B$-field is
assumed parallel to the arm, and the model results are applied to the optical
segment of the Carina-Sagittarius arm. The characteristic features of the
undular and interchange modes are clearly apparent in the simulations. The
undular mode creates large gas concentrations distributed along the arm. This
results in a clear arm/inter-arm difference: the instability triggers the
formation of large interstellar clouds inside the arms, but generates only
small structures with slight density enhancements in the inter-arm regions. The
resulting clouds are distributed in an antisymmetric way with respect to the
midplane, creating an azimuthal corrugation along the arm. For conditions
similar to those of the optical segment of the Carina-Sagittarius arm, it has a
wavelength of about 2.4 kpc. This structuring can explain the origin of both HI
superclouds and the azimuthal corrugations in spiral arms. The wavelength
matches the corrugation length derived with the young stellar groups located in
the optical segment of the Carina-Sagittarius arm. Keywords: Galaxy: kinematics

the timelike spherical collapse of a radiating, physical fluid in General
Relativity, as seen by an interior co-moving observer at rest in the physical
fluid, does not permit formation of ``trapped surfaces''. This followed from
the fact that the formation of a trapped surface in a physical fluid would
cause the timelike world lines of the collapsing fluid to become null at the
would be trapped surface, thus violating the Principle of Equivalence in
General Theory of Relativity. In this paper we generalize and extend this
result by studying the problem from the point of view of the exterior Vaidya
metric of a collapsing radiating fluid as seen by an exterior stationary
observer, and find that the ""no trapped surface condition"" becomes g00 > 0
consistent with that obtained for the interior co-moving metric. Since we have
shown that the Principle of Equivalence prevents trapped surfaces from being
formed in collapsing, radiating objects, then true event horizons cannot exist
and Galactic Black Hole Candidates (GBHC) must have physically observable
intrinsic magnetic dipole moments. Because of this fact it follows (Robertson

(AGN) with column densities in the range of 10^22-10^23 pcmsq, some of which
have quasar-like luminosities. According to obscuration models, the XRB above 8
keV is dominated by emission from Compton-thick AGN, with column densities
exceeding 1.5 times 10^24 pcmsq. Here, we consider whether Compton-thick
quasars are detectable by Chandra and XMM-Newton by their direct (i.e. not
scattered) X-ray emission. Detectability is optimized if the objects
individually have a high luminosity and high redshift, so that the direct
emission has a significant flux in the observed band. Using a simple galaxy
formation model incorporating accreting black holes, in which quasars build
most of their mass in a Compton-thick manner before expelling the obscuring
matter, we predict that moderately deep 100 ks Chandra and XMM-Newton exposures
may contain a handful of detectable Compton-thick quasars. Deep Ms or more
Chandra images should contain 50-100 distant, optically-faint, Compton-thick
sources. In passing we show that radiation pressure can be as effective in
expelling the obscuring gas as quasars winds, and yields a black hole mass
proportional to the velocity dispersion of the host bulge to the fourth power.

be between r^-3.2 and r^-4.0, with a best fit value of r^-3.88. We find the

  and supernova feedback","8 pages, 2 figures, Published in Nature, 22 November 2001",,"10.1038/35106523",,"astro-ph",,"  Clusters of galaxies are thought to contain about ten times as much dark
matter as baryonic matter. The dark component therefore dominates the
gravitational potential of the cluster, and the baryons confined by this
potential radiate X-rays with a luminosity that depends mainly on the gas
density in the cluster's core. Predictions of the X-rays' properties based on
models of cluster formation do not, however, agree with the observations. If
the models ignore the condensation of cooling gas into stars and feedback from
the associated supernovae, they overestimate the X-ray luminosity because the
density of the core gas is too high. An early episode of uniformly distributed
supernova feedback could rectify this by heating the uncondensed gas and
therefore making it harder to compress into the core, but such a process seems
to require an implausibly large number of supernovae. Here we show how
radiative cooling of intergalactic gas and subsequent supernova heating
conspire to eliminate highly compressible low-entropy gas from the intracluster
medium. This brings the core entropy and X-ray luminosities of clusters into
agreement with the observations, in a way that depends little on the efficiency
of supernova heating in the early Universe.

the radiation fields in a galactic bulge in order to examine the possibility
that the radiation drag could be an effective mechanism to extract angular
momentum in a spheroidal system like a bulge and allow plenty of gas to accrete
onto the galactic center. For this purpose, we numerically solve the
relativistic radiation hydrodynamical equation coupled with the accurate
radiative transfer and quantitatively assess the radiation drag efficiency. As
a result, we find that in an optically thick regime the radiation drag
efficiency is sensitively dependent on the density distributions of
interstellar medium (ISM). The efficiency drops according to $\tau_{\rm
T}^{-2}$ in an optically thick {\it uniform} ISM, where $\tau_{\rm T}$ is the
total optical depth of the dusty ISM, whereas the efficiency remains almost
constant at a high level if the ISM is {\it clumpy}. Hence, if the bulge
formation begins with a star formation event in a clumpy ISM, the radiation
drag will effectively work to remove the angular momentum and the accreted gas
may form a supermassive black hole. As a natural consequence, this mechanism
reproduces a putative linear relation between the mass of a supermassive black
hole and the mass of a galactic bulge, although further detailed modeling for
stellar evolution is required for the more precise prediction.

the need for sensitive absolutely calibrated polarization data. These are
essential for baseline setting and a correct interpretation of small-scale

mainly of protons since the ratio of the accelerated protons to electrons is
large and the flux of nuclei with charges Z>1 is strongly suppressed. Our
analysis has shown that the proton bremsstrahlung model is free from the
previously discussed problems of the high gamma-ray flux at MeV or at hundreds
of MeV energy regions. However, the model with proton bremsstrahlung requires
specific restrictions on the proton spectrum.The real problem of the proton
bremsstrahlung model is the large pressure of the accelerated protons in the

the gamma-ray line and continuous fluxes. On the other hand the electron
bremsstrahlung model requires more effective acceleration of background

soliton shape dressing via uniform translation of its centre of mass. The
second mode contributes in a negative energy for the repulsive case, but
positive energy in the attractive case. This unstability of the repulsive

or spin-0 particles. By adding their effects to those of gravity, they could
lead to apparent violations of the Equivalence Principle. While the vector part
in the couplings of a new spin-1 U boson involves, in general, a combination of
the B and L currents, there may also be, in addition, an axial part as well. If
the new force has a finite range \lambda, its intensity is proportional to
1/(\lambda^2 F^2), F being the extra U(1) symmetry-breaking scale.
  Quite surprisingly, particle physics experiments can provide constraints on
such a new force, even if it is extremely weak, the corresponding gauge
coupling being extremely small (<< 10^-19 !). An ``equivalence theorem'' shows
that a very light spin-1 U boson does not in general decouple even when its
gauge coupling vanishes, but behaves as a quasimassless spin-0 particle, having
pseudoscalar couplings proportional to 1/F. Similarly, in supersymmetric
theories, a very light spin-3/2 gravitino might be detectable as a quasi
massless spin-1/2 goldstino, despite the extreme smallness of Newton's
gravitational constant G_N, provided the supersymmetry-breaking scale is not
too large.
  Searches for such U bosons in \psi and \Upsilon decays restrict F to be
larger than the electroweak scale (the U actually becoming, as an axion, quasi
``invisible'' in particle physics for sufficiently large F). This provides
strong constraints on the corresponding new force and its associated EP
violations. We also discuss briefly new spin-dependent forces.

commensurate oscillator possesses the same number of globally defined constants

functions form the algebra su(N) with respect to the Poisson bracket. In the
isotropic case, the phase-space flows generated by the invariants can be
integrated globally to a set of finite transformations isomorphic to the group
SU(N). For a commensurate oscillator, however, the group SU(N) of symmetry
transformations is found to exist only on a reduced phase space, due to
unavoidable singularities of the flow in the full phase space. It is therefore
crucial to distinguish carefully between local and global definitions of
symmetry transformations in phase space. This result solves the longstanding

$L(\frac12,\pi_1\otimes\pi_2\otimes\pi_3)$ of the triple product L--function is
nonzero if and only if there exists a quaternion algebra $B$ over $\kay$ and
automorphic forms $f_i^B\in \pi_i^B$, such that the integral of the product

answer to the question whether, for a compact complex manifold which is a

that a deformation in the large of complex tori is again a complex torus, and
then that the same holds for products of a torus with a curve of genus $g\geq
2$. Together with old results of Blanchard, Calabi, and Sommese, who showed the
existence of non K\""ahler complex structures on the product of a curve with a
two dimensional complex torus, this gives the first counterexamples. We
generalize these constructions and we study the small deformations of what we
call Blanchard-Calabi 3-folds. These give infinitely many deformation
components. We give also a criterion for a complex manifold to be a complex
torus, namely, to have the same integral cohomology algebra of a complex torus,
and to possess $n$ independent holomorphic and d-closed 1-forms. As a
corollary, we give a classification of deformation types of real tori. We
illustrate then simple new examples of the author of surfaces of general type
which are $K(\pi, 1)$'s, and for which there are, for a fixed differentiable
structure, two different deformation types. These surfaces are quotients of
products of curves, and the moduli space for the fixed topological type has two
connected components, exchanged by complex conjugation. We also report, after
an elementary introduction to the problem, on recent results of the author and
P. Frediani on the Enriques classification of real surfaces (namely, the
classification of real hyperelliptic surfaces).

equations for the evolution of the curvature and the torsion, one set for each
moving curve. The first set is given by the usual Da Rios-Betchov equations.
The velocity at each point of the curve that corresponds to this set is well
known to be a local expression in the curve variables. In contrast, the
velocities of the other two curves are shown to be nonlocal expressions. Each
of the three curves is endowed with a corresponding infinite set of geometric
constraints. These moving space curves are found by using their connection with
the integrable Landau- Lifshitz equation. The three evolving curves
corresponding to the envelope soliton solution of the NLS are presented and
their behaviors compared.

dependence on the diffusivity, the decaying coefficient and the stirring due to
the chaotic flow is explicitly stated.
  We show that the presence of diffusion introduces a crossover length-scale,
the diffusion scale (L_d), such that the scaling behaviour for the structure
function is analytical for length-scales shorter than L_d, and shows a scaling
exponent that depends on the decaying term and the mixing of the flow for
larger scales. Therefore, the scaling exponents for scales larger than L_d are
not modified with respect to those calculated in the zero diffusion limit.
Moreover, L_d turns out to be independent of the decaying coeficient, being its
value the same as for the passive scalar with infinite lifetime.

Ion Collider (RHIC) magnet power supplies is essential to successful RHIC
operation. In order to support power supply commissioning, a system was
developed to capture detailed power supply measurements from all the RHIC ring
power supplies during acceleration ramps. Diagnostic tools were developed to
allow experts to assess ramp reproducibility and rapidly identify problems. The
system has now become a routine part of RHIC operations, with data captured for
every acceleration ramp. This paper describes the RHIC power supply ramp
diagnostic system and considers its impact on RHIC operations.

have been moved from mainframe to UNIX platforms and AFS (Andrew File System)
has been adopted as distributed file system. Further improvement we have added
regards data storage system; the choice of SAN (Storage Area Network) over
Fiber Channel, combined with power and flexibility of AFS, has made data
management over FTU very reliable. Performance tests have been done, showing
better transfer rate than previous system, based on JBOD modules with SCSI
connection.

  Moment of Atomic Yb","19 pages, 13 figures",,,,"physics.atom-ph",,"  The existence of a finite electric dipole moment (EDM) d_a of the
closed-shell atom Yb implies parity and time reversal violations involving the
nuclear sector. An important effect which can contribute to the Yb EDM is the
tensor-pseudotensor electron-nucleus interaction characterized by the coupling
constant C_T. Within the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics C_T=0, as this
form of interaction is not allowed. If a finite d_a of Yb is observed in
experiments, then an estimate of C_T can be obtained by combining with the
theoretical calculations. A non-zero C_T implies physics beyond the standard
model. In this paper we present the result of our ab initio calculation of the
EDM Yb using different many-body methods.

design reflects the Accelerator Device Model in which devices, named entities
in the control system, can be controlled via properties. RDA implements this
model in a distributed environment with devices residing in servers that can
run anywhere in the controls network. It provides a location-independent and
reliable access to the devices from control programs. By invoking the device
access methods, clients can read, write and subscribe to device property
values. We describe the architecture and design of RDA, its API, and
CORBA-based implementations in Java and C++. First applications of RDA in the
CERN accelerator control systems are described as well.

subset H_s of separable states. This violation equals the euclidean distance in

functional are only different aspects of the same geometric picture. This is
explicitly illustrated in the example of two spins, where also a comparison
with familiar Bell inequalities is presented.
