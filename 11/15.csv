nm, arranged in three different geometries: open fractal (dimension D = 1.77),
simple cubic and face-centred cubic. The rigorous solution shows that the
extinction of the fractal clusters, with N < 50 and particle radii 10 nm,
displays a peak within 2% of the location of the observed interstellar
extinction peak at ~4.6 inverse micron; the smaller the cluster, the closer its
peak gets to this value. By contrast, the peak in the extinction of the more
compact clusters lie more than 4% from 4.6 inverse micron. At short wavelengths
(0.1 - 0.5 micron), all the methods show that fractal clusters have markedly
different extinction from those of non-fractal clusters. At wavelengths > 5
micron, the rigorous solution indicates that the extinction from fractal and
compact clusters are of the same order of magnitude. It was only possible to
compute fully converged results of the rigorous solution for the smaller
clusters, due to computational limitations, however, we find that both
discrete-dipole approximation methods overestimate the computed extinction of
the smaller fractal clusters.

  ASP Conference Series, P. Crowther Ed",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In this review, I present the case for how massive stars may form through
stellar collisions. This mechanism requires very high stellar densities, up to
4 orders of magnitude higher than are observed in the cores of dense young
clusters. In this model, the required stellar densities arise due to gas
accretion onto stars in the cluster core, including the precursers of the
massive stars. This forces the core to contract until the stellar densities are
sufficiently high for collisions to occur. Gas accretion is also likely to play
a major role in determining the distribution of stellar masses in the cluster
as well as the observed mass segregation. One of the main advantages of this
mechanism is that it explicitly relies on the cluster environment in order to
produce the massive stars. It is thus in a position to explain the relation
between clustered and massive star formation which is not an obvious outcome of
an isolated accretion mechanism. A recent numerical simulation supports this
model as the cluster core increases its density by $10^5$ during gas accretion.
Approximately 15 stellar collisions occur (with $R_{coll}=1$ au) in the cluster
core, making a significant contribution to the mass of the most massive star.

scenario for protoplanetary disks in which the disk mass of small (50 micron)
particles decreases homologously with time, but the disk structure and stellar
parameters do not change. Our goal is to identify optimal infrared spectral
indicators of the existence of disks, their structure, and mass evolution that
may be tested with the upcoming SIRTF mission. We present simulated spectral
energy distributions and colors over a wide range of masses. The SED is most
sensitive to disk mass in the far-IR and longer wavelengths, which is already
known from millimeter and radio observations. As the disk mass decreases, the
excess emission of the disk over the stellar photosphere diminishes more
rapidly at the longest rather than at short wavelengths. At near-infrared
wavelengths, the disk remains optically thick to stellar radiation over a wide
range of disk mass, resulting in a slower decline in the SED in this spectral
regime. Therefore, near-IR excesses (K-L) provide a robust means of detecting
disks in star clusters down to 1E-7 solar masses, while the far-IR excess
probes the disk mass. Reducing the disk mass results in a clear progression in
color-color diagrams with low mass disks displaying the bluest colors. We
interpret color-color diagrams for Taurus-Auriga sources in the context of
decreasing disk mass.

VLBI together may be hinting at a picture in which Bondi-Hoyle accretion from
an ambient ionized medium feeds a standard disk accreting at ~ 4.0*10^{22} g
s^{-1}. Somewhere near the event horizon, this plasma is heated to >10^{11} K,
where it radiates via thermal synchrotron (producing a radio component) and
self-Comptonization (accounting for a nonthermal X-ray flux). This temperature
is much greater than its virial value and the hot cloud expands at roughly the
sound speed (~0.1c), after which it begins to accelerate on a parsec scale to
relativistic velocities. In earlier work, the emission from the extended jet
has been modeled successfully using nonthermal synchrotron self-Compton
processes, with a self-absorbed inner core. In the picture we are developing
here, the initial ejection of matter is associated with a self-absorbed thermal
radio component that dominates the core emission on the smallest scales. The
nonthermal particle distributions responsible for the emission in the extended
jet are then presumably energized, e.g., via shock acceleration, within the
expanding, hot gas. The power associated with this plasma represents an
accretion efficiency of about 0.54, requiring dissipation in a prograde disk
around a rapidly spinning black hole (with spin parameter a~1).

degree MPG/ESO Wide Field Imager together with supplementary B-band
observations, we build up a comprehensive picture of the light and mass
distributions in this region. We find that, on average, the light from the
early-type galaxies traces the dark matter fairly well, although one cluster is
a notable exception to this rule. The clusters themselves exhibit a range of
mass-to-light (M/L) ratios, X-ray properties, and galaxy populations. We
attempt to model the relation between the total mass and the light from the
early-type galaxies with a simple scale-independent linear biasing model. We
find M/L_B=130h for the early type galaxies with zero stochasticity, which, if
taken at face value, would imply Omega_m < 0.1. However, this linear relation
breaks down on small scales and on scales equivalent to the average cluster
separation (approximately 1 Mpc), demonstrating that a single M/L ratio is not
adequate to fully describe the mass-light relation in the supercluster. Rather,
the scatter in M/L ratios observed for the clusters supports a model
incorporating non-linear biasing or stochastic processes. Finally, there is a
clear detection of filamentary structure connecting two of the clusters, seen
in both the galaxy and dark matter distributions, and we discuss the effects of
cluster-cluster and cluster-filament interactions as a means to reconcile the

of Halpha, [OII], and one or both of [NII] and [SII]. For a subset of the
galaxies, 60 and 100 micron IRAS fluxes are available. We compare the star
formation rates derived using the models with those derived using standard
estimators based on the Halpha, the [OII] and the far-infrared luminosities of
the galaxies. The CL01 SFR estimates agree well with those derived from the
IRAS fluxes, but are typically a factor of ~3 higher than those derived from
the Halpha or the [OII] fluxes, even after the usual mean attenuation
correction of A_Halpha=1 mag is applied to the data. We show that the reason
for this discrepancy is that the standard Halpha estimator neglects the
absorption of ionizing photons by dust in HII regions and the contamination of
Halpha emission by stellar absorption. We also use our sample to study
variations in star formation and metallicity as a function of galaxy absolute
bJ magnitude. For this sample, the star formation rate per unit bJ luminosity
is independent of magnitude. The gas-phase oxygen abundance does increase with
bJ luminosity, although the scatter in metallicity at fixed magnitude is large.

J1347-1145, the most luminous X-ray cluster of galaxies discovered to date.
With two exceptions, all the galaxies in this sample have red B-R colors and
red spectral indices, with spectra similar to old local ellipticals. Using all
47 cluster members, we derive a mean redshift of 0.4509\pm 0.003, and a
velocity dispersion of 910\pm130 km/sec, which corresponds to a virial mass of
4.4 x 10^{14} h^{-1} Solar masses with an harmonic radius of 380 h^{-1} kpc.
The derived total dynamical mass is marginally consistent with that deduced
from the cluster's X-ray emission based on the analysis of ROSAT/ASCA images
(Schindler et al. 1997), but not consistent with the more recent X-ray analyses
of Allen (2000), Ettori, Allen & Fabian (2001) and Allen, Schmidt & Fabian
(2002). Furthermore, the dynamical mass is significantly smaller than that
derived from weak lensing (Fischer & Tyson 1997) and from strong lensing (Sahu
et al. 1998). We propose that these various discrepant mass estimates may be
understood if RX J1347-1145 is the product of two clusters caught in the act of
merging in a direction perpendicular to the line of sight, although there is no
evidence from the galaxy redshift distribution supporting this hypothesis. Even
with this hypothesis, a significant part of the extremely high X-ray luminosity
must still arise from non-virialized, presumably shocked, gas. Finally, we
report the serendipitous discovery of a lensed background galaxy at z=4.083

very metal-poor stars based on high-resolution spectra. One star, CS22948-027,
exhibits very large overabundances of carbon, nitrogen, and the neutron-capture
elements, as found in the previous study of Hill et al.. This result may be
interpreted as a consequence of mass transfer from a binary companion that
previously evolved through the asymptotic giant branch stage. By way of
contrast, the other four stars we investigate exhibit no overabundances of
barium ([Ba/Fe]<0), while three of them have mildly enhanced carbon and/or
nitrogen ([C+N]+1). We have been unable to determine accurate carbon and
nitrogen abundances for the remaining star (CS30312-100). These stars are
rather similar to the carbon-rich, neutron-capture-element-poor star
CS22957-027 discussed previously by Norris et al., though the carbon
overabundance in this object is significantly larger ([C/Fe]=+2.2). Our results
imply that these carbon-rich objects with ``normal'' neutron-capture element
abundances are not rare among very metal-deficient stars. One possible process
to explain this phenomenon is as a result of helium shell flashes near the base
of the AGB in very low-metallicity, low-mass (M~< 1M_sun) stars, as recently
proposed by Fujimoto et al..
  The moderate carbon enhancements reported herein ([C/Fe]+1) are similar to
those reported in the famous r-process-enhanced star CS22892-052. We discuss
the possibility that the same process might be responsible for this similarity,
as well as the implication that a completely independent phenomenon was
responsible for the large r-process enhancement in CS22892-052.

bendings in the distributions when N_{HI}<10^{20} cm^{-2} and H is no longer
fully neutral. If an ultraviolet background is responsible for the gas
ionization, and g(N_{H}) is proportional N_{H}^{-alpha}, we find the values of
alpha and of the intensity of the background radiation which are compatible
with the present data. These best fitting values, however, depend upon the
scaling law of the the gas volume densities with N_{H} and cannot be determined
unambiguously. We examine in detail two models: one in which the average gas
volume density decreases steadily with N_H, while in the other it stays
constant at low column densities. The former model leads to a steep power law
fit for g(N_{H}), with alpha of order 3.3 +- 0.4 and requires an ultraviolet
flux larger than what the QSOs alone produce at z=0. For the latter alpha is
1.5 +- 0.1 and a lower ionizing flux is required. The ambiguities about the
modelling and the resulting steep or shallow N_{H} distribution can be resolved
only if new 21-cm observations and QSOs Lyman limit absorbers searches will
provide more data in the HI-HII transition region at low redshifts. Using the
best fit obtained for higher redshift data we outline two possible scenarios

presented, and are considered to give a fair picture of the level of
reliability of the predictions of the actinide production, at least in the

not provide a means for drawing comparisons between the crystal structures of
grains condensed in these environments and found in meteorites.
  This is proven first by comparing theoretical band profiles calculated for
ellipsoidal particles, which show clearly a strong dependence on the axis ratio
of the ellipsoids but negligible differences for the two most common polytypes.
Second, spectra measured on submicron particle samples in the laboratory do not
show any obvious correlation of band position or shape to the polytype.
However, we demonstrate by measurements on SiC whiskers that grain shape is
able to determine the spectrum completely. A further strong systematic
influence on the band profile can be exerted by plasmon-phonon coupling due to
conductivity of the SiC material. The latter fact probably is responsible for
the confusion in the astronomical literature about spectral properties of SiC
grains. We show that, although the conductivity seems to be a common property
of many SiC laboratory samples, it is, however, independent of the polytype.

Restricting wave growth mainly parallel to the external magnetic field, the
isotropization mechanism is identified to be the Electron Firehose Instability
(EFI). The free energy in the electrons is first transformed into left-hand
circularly polarized transverse low-frequency waves by a non-resonant
interaction. Fast electrons can then be scattered towards higher perpendicular
velocities by gyroresonance, leading finally to a complete isotropization of
the velocity distribution. During this phase of the instability, Langmuir waves
are generated which may lead to the emission of radio waves. A large fraction
of the protons is resonant with the left-hand polarized electromagnetic waves,
creating a proton temperature anisotropy $T_\|^p < T_\perp^p$. The parameters
of the simulated plasma are chosen compatible to solar flare conditions. The
results indicate the significance of this mechanism in the particle
acceleration context: The EFI limits the anisotropy of the electron velocity
distribution, and thus provides the necessary condition for further
acceleration. It enhances the pitch-angle of the electrons and heats the ions.

energetics of lateral manipulation was found to be subtle. In the case of
vertical manipulation of a Cu adatom on flat, stepped, and kinked Cu surfaces
we find an unusual but interesting result. It is found that as the tip
approaches the surface, it becomes easier to extract the adatom from the
stepped and kinked surfaces, as compared to the flat surface. This counter
intuitive result can be explained in terms of tip induced changes in the
bonding of the adatom to its low coordinated surroundings.

and lattice degrees of freedom are one of the central issues in colossal
magnetoresistive manganites. The orbital degree of freedom has until recently
remained hidden, since it does not couple directly to most of experimental
probes. Development of synchrotron light sources has changed the situation; by
the resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) technique the orbital ordering has
successfully been observed . In this article, we review progress in the recent
studies of RXS in manganites. We start with a detailed review of the RXS
experiments applied to the orbital ordered manganites and other correlated
electron systems. We derive the scattering cross section of RXS where the
tensor character of the atomic scattering factor (ASF) with respect to the
x-ray polarization is stressed. Microscopic mechanisms of the anisotropic
tensor character of ASF is introduced and numerical results of ASF and the
scattering intensity are presented. The azimuthal angle scan is a unique
experimental method to identify RXS from the orbital degree of freedom. A
theory of the azimuthal angle and polarization dependence of the RXS intensity
is presented. The theoretical results show good agreement with the experiments
in manganites. Apart from the microscopic description of ASF, a theoretical
framework of RXS to relate directly to the 3d orbital is presented. The
scattering cross section is represented by the correlation function of the
pseudo-spin operator for the orbital degree of freedom. A theory is extended to
the resonant inelastic x-ray scattering and methods to observe excitations of
the orbital degree of freedom are proposed.

investigated by using the method of generalized tortoise coordinate

depend on the time. It is shown that Hawking radiation of photons exists only
for the complex Maxwell scalar $\phi_0$ in the advanced Eddington-Finkelstein
coordinate system. This asymmetry of Hawking radiation for different components
of Maxwell fields probably arises from the asymmetry of spacetime in the
advanced Eddington-Finkelstein coordinate system. It is shown that the black

section is presented. We first consider the massless scalar field defined in a
four-dimensional Euclidean space. To identify the infinities of the vacuum
fluctuations we use a combination of dimensinal and zeta function analytic
regularization procedures. The infinities which occur in the one-loop vacuum
fluctuations fall into two distinct classes: ultraviolet divergences that are
renormalized by the introduction of bulk counterterms and also surface and
edges divergences that demand countertems concentrated on the boundaries. We
present the detailed form of the surface and edge divergences. Finally we
discuss how to generalize our calculations for a confined massive scalar field
defined in a higher dimensional Euclidean space.

occurrence of Dynamical Localization (DL) in driven quantum systems with two
incommensurate frequencies. If both frequencies are associated to impulsive
terms, DL is permanently destroyed. In this case, we show that the evolution is
similar to a decoherent case. On the other hand, if both frequencies are
associated to smooth driving functions, DL persists although on a time scale
longer than in the periodic case. When the driving function consists of a
series of pulses of duration $\sigma$, we show that the localization time
increases as $\sigma^{-2}$ as the impulsive limit, $\sigma\to 0$, is
approached. In the intermediate case, in which only one of the frequencies is
associated to an impulsive term in the Hamiltonian, a transition from a
localized to a delocalized dynamics takes place at a certain critical value of
the strength parameter. We provide an estimate for this critical value, based
on analytical considerations. We show how, in all cases, the frequency spectrum
of the dynamical response can be used to understand the global features of the
motion. All results are numerically checked.

different polarization transfer coefficients have been considered. This
3NF-like effect is generated by the pion-exchange diagram in presence of a
two-nucleon correlation and is partially cancelled by meson-retardation
contributions. Indications are provided that such type of effects are capable
to selectively increase the vector (nucleon and deuteron) analyzing powers,
while in the considered energy range they are almost negligible on the
differential cross sections. These indications, observed with different
realistic nucleon-nucleon interactions, provide additional evidences that such
3NF-like effects have indeed the potential to solve the puzzle of the vector
analyzing powers. Smaller but non negligible effects are observed for the other
spin observables. In some cases, we find that the modifications introduced by
such pionic effects on these spin observables (other than the vector analyzing
powers) are significant and interesting and could be observed by experiments.

sphere situated in an evanescent field is calculated, using electromagnetic
wave theory. The present work is a continuation of an earlier paper [E. Almaas
and I. Brevik, J. Opt. Soc. Am. B {\bf 12}, 2429 (1995)], in which both the
horizontal and the vertical radiation forces were calculated with the
constraint that the sphere was nonabsorbing. Whereas the horizontal force can
be well accounted for within this constraint, there is no possibility to
describe the {\it repulsiveness} of the vertical force, so distinctly
demonstrated in the Kawata-Sugiura experiment [Opt. Lett. {\bf 17}, 772
(1992)], unless a departure from the theory of pure nondispersive dielectrics
is made in some way. Introduction of absorption, i.e. a complex refractive
index, is one natural way of generalizing the previous theory. We work out
general expressions for the vertical force for this case and illustrate the
calculations by numerical computations. It turns out that, when applied to the
Kawata-Sugiura case, the repulsive radiation force caused by absorption is {\it
not} strong enough to account for the actual lifting of the polystyrene latex
or glass spheres. The physical reason for the experimental outcome is, in this
case, most probably the presence of surfactants making the surface of the
spheres partially conducting.
