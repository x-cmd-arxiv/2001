and NGC 6868 (in the Telescopium loose group) with the Keck II and the VLT-I
telescopes. Both galaxies are the optically brightest galaxy of their groups.
NGC 1199 has two companion galaxies at a median projected distance of only 33
kpc and, based in its peculiar internal structure and large X-ray halo, NGC
6868 has been proposed to be a merger remnant. Our analysis of $B$ and $R$
images uncovered a population of globular clusters around both galaxies, with
total (and local) specific frequency S_N = 3.6\pm1.8 (3.4\pm1.5) for NGC 1199
and S_N = 1.8\pm1.1 (0.8\pm0.4) for NGC 6868. The radial profile of the
globulars of NGC 1199 follows the light distribution of the galaxy and can be
fitted by a power--law and a ``core model'' with a very steep slope (\alpha =
2.5\pm0.3). In the case of NGC 6868, the profile of the globulars is well
fitted by a power--law and a ``core model'' profile of slope 1.4\pm0.3 and is
shallower than the galaxy light distribution. Maximum-likelihood fitting of two
Gaussians to the globular cluster color distribution yields a high significance
for multi-modality with peaks centered at (B-R)_0 = 1.13\pm0.04 and 1.42\pm0.04
(NGC 1199) and (B-R)_0=1.12\pm0.07 and 1.42\pm0.07 (NGC 6868). NGC 1199 and NGC
6868 are good examples of galaxies where the group environment are likely to
have affected their dynamical evolution. We find that for NGC 1199, the
properties of the globular cluster system are similar to those for other
systems around external elliptical galaxies located in less dense environments,
but with a very steep radial profile. In the case of NGC 6868, we find a
regular radial profile and color distribution and a comparatively low specific
frequency for the globular cluster system of the galaxy.

an accretion rate of ~10^{-8} M_sun yr^{-1}.

this we re-analyse four sequences of densely-sampled, high signal-to-noise
echelle spectra of AB Doradus spanning several stellar rotations in 1996
December. Using spectral subtraction, least-squares deconvolution and
matched-filter analysis, we demonstrate that it is possible to measure directly
the velocity amplitudes and rotation periods of large numbers of individual
starspots at low to intermediate latitude. We derive values for the equatorial
rotation rate and the magnitude of the surface differential rotation, both of

Cameron (1997) from cross-correlation of Doppler images derived a year earlier

Donati et al (2000). The differences between the rotation rates of individual
spots and the fitted differential rotation law are substantially greater than
the observational errors. The smaller spots show a greater scatter about the
mean relation than the larger ones, which suggests that buffeting by turbulent
supergranular flows could be responsible.

J124602.54+011318.8, associated with a galaxy at a redshift of 0.385. In this
paper we consider the possibility that the OT may be a GRB afterglow. Three
sets of images and two sets of spectra were obtained as part of the normal
operations of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In the first two image sets,
observed two nights apart, the object appears as a point source at
$r^{*}\approx 17$. The third image set, observed about 410 days later, shows an
extended source which is more than 2.5 magnitudes fainter. The spectra were
observed about 400 and 670 days after the first two image sets, and both show
an apparently normal galaxy at a redshift of 0.385. Associating the OT with the
galaxy, the absolute magnitude was $M_{r^*}=-24.8$, which is over 4 magnitudes
brighter than the most luminous supernova ever measured. The spectral energy
distributions of the galaxy-subtracted OT derived from the first two image sets
are well-fit by single power-laws with indices of $\beta_{\nu}=-0.92$ and -1.29
respectively, similar to most GRB afterglows. Based upon the luminosity of the
OT, non-detections in contemporaneous ROTSE-I images, and the change in
spectral slope, the OT, if an afterglow, was likely discovered early during a
``plateau'' or slowly-fading phase. The discovery of a GRB afterglow at this
stage of the SDSS is consistent with expectations, but only if the optical
emission is much less strongly beamed than the gamma-rays. We emphasize that
other explanations for the OT cannot be ruled out; a recent follow-up study by
[galyam02] provides strong evidence that this source is in fact an unusual AGN.

the uncertainties in the atomic data, pointing out that one or more components

dynamical evolution of clusters containing stars with individual masses m_1 as
well as a tracer population of objects with individual masses m_2=\mu m_1,
using N=10^5 total stars. For heavy tracers, which could represent stellar
remnants such as neutron stars or black holes in a globular cluster, we
characterize in a variety of ways the tendency for these objects to concentrate
in or near the cluster core. In agreement with simple theoretical arguments, we
find that the characteristic time for this mass segregation process varies as
1/\mu. For models with very light tracers (\mu <~ 10^-2), which could represent
free-floating planets or brown dwarfs, we find the expected depletion of light
objects in the cluster core, but also sometimes a significant enhancement in
the halo. Using these results we estimate the optical depth to gravitational
microlensing by planetary mass objects or brown dwarfs in typical globular
clusters. For some initial conditions, the optical depth in the halo due to
very low-mass objects could be much greater than that of luminous stars. If we
apply our results to M22, using the recent null detection of Sahu, Anderson, &

from bright stars, ghosts, and high galactic extinction masked out. This survey
region, which forms part of the SDSS Early Data Release, is the same as that
for which two-point angular clustering statistics have recently been computed.
The third and fourth moments of the cell counts, $s_3$ (skewness) and $s_4$
(kurtosis), constitute the most accurate measurements to date of these
quantities (for $r^\prime < 21$) over angular scales $0.015^\circ-0.3^\circ$.
They display the approximate hierarchical scaling expected from non-linear
structure formation models and are in reasonable agreement with the predictions
of $\Lambda$-dominated cold dark matter models with galaxy biasing that
suppresses higher order correlations at small scales. The results are in
general consistent with previous measurements in the APM, EDSGC, and Deeprange

we consider spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes in vacuum or with a
minimally coupled scalar field, within the Einstein-Christoffel symmetric

characteristic propagation of the main variables and constraints, we are able
to single out the only free modes at the outer boundary for these problems. In
the vacuum case a single free modes exists which corresponds to a gauge
freedom, while in the matter case an extra mode exists which is associated with
the scalar field. We make use of the fact that the EC formulation has no
superluminal characteristic speeds to excise the singularity. We present a
second-order, finite difference discretization to treat these scenarios, where
we implement these constraint-preserving boundary conditions, and are able to
evolve the system for essentially unlimited times. As a test of the robustness

that physical invariance may arise by patching smooth functions that are

requires light and heavy states to mix under transformation, is allowed in
principle, although the Jarlskog parameter J_CP(T) must be amended relative to
previous results. However, a toy model of modular invariant mass terms
indicates that the assumption underlying these results is unrealistic. In
general the mass eigenstate basis is manifestly modular invariant and coupling
constants are smooth invariant functions of T, thus CP is unbroken on the unit

(under the presence of base points).
  The main result in the paper consists in showing an explicit deformation of

system has no base points (the latter were already classified by the second
author). That such a deformation should exist was claimed by F. Enriques and
holds true by abstract deformation theory and dimension counts. Our deformation
is explicitly gotten by writing the equations of the canonical ring as the
(4x4)-Pfaffians of an antisymmetric and extrasymmetric (6x6)-matrix.
  Deforming the matrix, we get, for $t \neq 0$, that the Pfaffians reduce to
the (4x4)-Pfaffians of an antisymmetric (5x5)-matrix. This type of deformation

often be recast as the problem of counting (perfect) matchings of some subgraph
of an Aztec diamond graph A_n, or more generally calculating the sum of the
weights of all the matchings, where the weight of a matching is equal to the
product of the (pre-assigned) weights of the constituent edges (assumed to be
non-negative). This article presents efficient algorithms that work in this
context to solve three problems: finding the sum of the weights of the
matchings of a weighted Aztec diamond graph A_n; computing the probability that
a randomly-chosen matching of A_n will include a particular edge (where the
probability of a matching is proportional to its weight); and generating a
matching of A_n at random. The first of these algorithms is equivalent to a
special case of Mihai Ciucu's cellular complementation algorithm and can be
used to solve many of the same problems. The second of the three algorithms is
a generalization of not-yet-published work of Alexandru Ionescu, and can be
employed to prove an identity governing a three-variable generating function
whose coefficients are all the edge-inclusion probabilities; this formula has
been used as the basis for asymptotic formulas for these probabilities, but a
proof of the generating function identity has not hitherto been published. The
third of the three algorithms is a generalization of the domino-shuffling
algorithm described by Elkies, Kuperberg, Larsen and Propp; it enables one to
generate random ``diabolo-tilings of fortresses'' and thereby to make
intriguing inferences about their asymptotic behavior.
