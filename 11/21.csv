power-law behavior, with an exponent of roughly -2. This spectrum is
indistinguishable from the mass spectrum of dark matter halos predicted by cold

galaxies is one of the principal applications of weak gravitational lensing.
  From the observable ellipticities of images of background galaxies, the tidal
gravitational field (shear) of the mass distribution is estimated, and the
corresponding surface mass density is constructed. The noise of the resulting
mass map is investigated here, generalizing previous work which included mainly
the noise due to the intrinsic galaxy ellipticities. Whereas this dominates the
noise budget if the lens is very weak, other sources of noise become important,
or even dominant, for the medium-strong lensing regime close to the center of
clusters. In particular, shot noise due to a Poisson distribution of galaxy
images, and increased shot noise owing to the correlation of galaxies in
angular position and redshift, can yield significantly larger levels of noise
than that from the intrinsic ellipticities only. We estimate the contributions
from these various effects for two widely used smoothing operations, showing
that one of them effectively removes the Poisson and the correlation noises
related to angular positions of galaxies. Noise sources due to the spread in
redshift of galaxies are still present in the optimized estimator and are shown
to be relevant in many cases. We show how (even approximate) redshift
information can be profitably used to reduce the noise in the mass map. The
dependence of the various noise terms on the relevant parameters (lens
redshift, strength, smoothing length, redshift distribution of background
galaxies) are explicitly calculated and simple estimates are provided.

shows local variations and a clumpy distribution on time scales of several
hundred Myr. This clumpy structure does not disapear over a time of a few tens
of Myr, even if the rate of SNe is increased to ten times the Galactic rate.
These local variations occur because, even in the presence of numerical
diffusion, gas does not mix quickly between hot and cold regions. The lower
limit that we are able to place on the mixing time at the kpc scale is already
longer than the time for chemistry to reach local equilibrium in the gas. The

properties of VROs using the 1 Ms Chandra exposure of an 8.4'x8.4' region
within the Hawaii Flanking-Field area containing the HDF-N. We find that VROs
detected in the hard band (2-8 keV) have flat X-ray spectral slopes (Gamma ~
0.9) and X-ray properties consistent with those expected from luminous obscured
AGN. The fraction of such sources in the K<=20.1 VRO population is ~14%.
Conversely, the average X-ray spectral slope of VROs detected in the soft band
(0.5-2 keV) but not in the hard band is comparatively steep (Gamma>1.4), and
the X-ray emission from these sources is consistent with that expected from
less energetic processes (i.e., star formation, low-luminosity AGN activity,
normal elliptical galaxy emission); star-formation and low-luminosity AGN
activity scenarios are favored in those sources with irregular optical
morphologies. Stacking analyses of the X-ray emission from VROs not
individually detected at X-ray energies yield significant detections (>=99%
confidence) in the soft band and the full band (0.5-8 keV). We find this X-ray
emission is produced predominantly by the optically brightest VROs. The
simplest explanation of this result is that we have detected the average X-ray
emission from non-active VROs with low X-ray-to-optical flux ratios [log(FX/FI)
~ -2]; this is consistent with that expected if the majority of these VROs are

with a stellar spiral arm. We model the gaseous medium as a self-gravitating,
magnetized, differentially-rotating, razor-thin disk. The basic flow shocks and
compresses as it passes through a local segment of a tightly-wound, trailing
stellar spiral arm, modeled as a rigidly-rotating gravitational potential. We
first construct 1D profiles for flows with spiral shocks. When the post-shock
Toomre parameter Q_sp is sufficiently small, self-gravity is too large for
one-dimensional steady solutions to exist. The critical values of Q_sp are 0.8,
0.5, and 0.4 for our models with zero, sub-equipartition, and equipartition
magnetic fields, respectively. We then study the growth of self-gravitating
perturbations in fully 2D flows, and find that spur-like structures rapidly
emerge in our magnetized models. We associate this gravitational instability
with the magneto-Jeans mechanism, in which magnetic tension forces oppose the
Coriolis forces. The shearing and expanding velocity field shapes the condensed
material into spurs as it flows downstream from the arms. Although we find
swing amplification can help form spurs when the arm-interarm contrast is
moderate, unmagnetized systems that are quasi-axisymmetrically stable are
generally also stable to nonaxisymmetric perturbations, suggesting that
magnetic effects are essential. In nonlinear stages, the spurs in our models
undergo fragmentation to form 4\times 10^6 solar mass clumps, which we suggest
could evolve into bright arm/interarm HII regions as seen in spiral galaxies.

the Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropy spectrum. By studying the neutrino
decoupling with Boltzmann equations, one can show that this quantity differs
from the number of massless neutrino species for an additional contribution due
to a partial heating of neutrinos during the electron-positron annihilations,
leading to non thermal features in their final distributions. In this paper we
review the different results obtained in the literature and perform a new
analysis which takes into account, in a fully consistent way, the QED
corrections at finite temperature to the photon and e^+- plasma equation of

assembly of primordial molecular cloud cores. The primordial molecular cloud
cores, which resemble those at the present epoch, can emerge around $1+z \sim
20$ according to recent numerical simulations. A core typically contracts to
form the first generation of stars and the contracting core emits H$_2$ and HD
line radiation. These lines show a double peak feature. The higher peak is the
H$_2$ line of the $J=2-0$ (v=0) rotational transition, and the lower peak is
the HD line of the $J=4-3$ (v=0) rotational transition. The ratio of the peaks
is about 20, this value characterising the emission from primordial galaxies.
The expected emission flux at the redshift of $1+z \sim 20$ (e.g. $\Omega_m =
0.3$ and $\Omega_\Lambda =0.7$), in the $J=2-0$ (v=0) line of H$_2$ occurs at a
rate $\sim 2 \times 10^{-7}$ Jy, and in the $J=4-3$ (v=0) line of HD at a rate
$\sim 4 \times 10^{-9}$ Jy. The former has a frequency of 5.33179$\times
10^{11}$ Hz and the latter is at 5.33388 $\times 10^{11}$Hz, respectively.
Since the frequency resolution of ALMA is about 40 kHz, the double peak is
resolvable. While an individual object is not observable even by ALMA, the
expected assembly of primordial star clusters on subgalactic scales can result
in fluxes at the 2000-50 $\mu$Jy level. These are marginally observable. The
first peak of H$_2$ is produced when the core gas cools due to HD cooling,
while the second peak of HD occurs because the medium maintains thermal balance
by H$_2$ cooling which must be enhanced by three-body reactions to form H$_2$
itself.

The X-ray image consists of four lensed image components, thus the photons are
from the lensed QSO itself. The overall spectrum can be described with a
power-law function heavily absorbed by neutral matter at a redshift consistent
with the QSO redshift. This supports the idea that intrinsic absorption is
significant for BAL QSOs. The spectral fit significantly (99% confidence)
improves when we include an emission line. The centroid energy and intrinsic
width (Gaussian \sigma) of the line are 6.21 \pm 0.16 keV and 220
^{+270}_{-130} eV (90% errors), respectively, in the QSO rest frame, assuming
the absorbed power-law as the continuum. The equivalent width of the line in
the QSO rest frame is 960 ^{+1400}_{-480} eV. We suggest that the large
equivalent width, the centroid energy, and the line broadness can be explained
by iron K emission arising from X-ray reprocessing in the BAL flow, assuming it

Field North (HDFN). Among the 76 galaxies detected by XMM in the LH area (200
square arcminutes), 24 show mid-IR emission, but the relative percentage of
X-ray sources with mid-IR counterparts increases with the band energy: from 30%
of the 0.5-2 keV sources up to 63% of the 5-10 keV sources. In contrast, only a
small fraction of the mid-IR sources (around 10%) show X-ray emission. In the
region centred on the HDFN (24 square arcminutes), 25% of the mid-IR sources
are detected in the X-ray, while 30-40% of the X-ray sources show mid-IR
emission. Under the conservative assumption that all XMM sources are
AGN-dominated, AGNs contribute 15% of the total mid-IR flux in the LH. For the
HDFN we have assumed that AGN-dominated sources are luminous X-ray sources with
radio to X-ray SEDs typical of local AGNs, in which case we find that 18% of
the mid-IR flux are due to AGN emission. If we put together all the existing
information from the deepest HDFN data to the shallow large-area BeppoSAX
observations in the ELAIS S1 region using the median mid-IR to X-ray spectral
indices as a function of the X-ray flux, we find an AGN contribution to the

fraction identified with Extremely Red Objects (R-K > 5) and galaxies with SEDs
typical of normal massive ellipticals or spirals at z ~ 1. The high 0.5-10 keV
X-ray luminosities of these objects (1E43-1E45 erg/s) indicate that the
ultimate energy source is gravitational accretion, while the X-ray to IR flux
ratios and the X-ray spectral hardness show evidence of photoelectric
absorption at low X-ray energies. An important hint on the physics comes from
the mid-IR data at 6.7 and 15 um, well reproduced by model spectra of
completely obscured quasars under standard assumptions and l.o.s. optical
depths tau ~ 30-40. Other predictions of the standard XRB picture, like the
distributions of intrinsic bolometric luminosities and the relative fractions
of type-I and -II objects (1:3), are also consistent with our results. Obscured
gravitational accretion is then confirmed as being responsible for the bulk of
the X-ray background, since we detect in the IR the down-graded energy
photoelectrically absorbed in X-rays: 63% of the faint 5-10 keV XMM sources are
detected in the mid-IR by Fadda et al. (2001). However, although as much as 90%
of the X-ray energy production could be converted to IR photons, no more than
20% of the Cosmic IR Background can be attributed to X-ray loud AGNs.

three-terminal (3T) geometry in which the third contact is connected weakly to

two-dimensional Heisenberg models on a square lattice with a given
dimerization. Our aim is threefold: First, we want to investigate the
dimensional transition from two to one dimension for three models consisting of
weakly coupled chains for large dimerizations. Simple scaling arguments show
that the interchain coupling is always relevant. The ground states of two of
these models therefore have one-dimensional nature only at the decoupling
point. The third considered model is more complicated, because it contains
additional relevant intrachain couplings leading to a gap as shown by scaling
arguments and numerical investigations. Second, we investigate at which point
the dimerization destroys the N\'eel ordered ground state of the isotropic
model. Within a mapping to a nonlinear sigma-model and linear spinwave theory
(LSWT) we conclude that the stability of the N\'eel ordered state depends on
the microscopic details of the model. Third, the considered models also can be
regarded as effective models for a spin system with spin-phonon coupling. This
leads to the question if a spin-Peierls transition, i.e. a gain of total energy
due to lattice distortion, is possible. LSWT shows that such a transition is
possible under certain conditions leading to a coexistence of long-range order
and spin-Peierls dimerization. We also find that the gain of magnetic energy is
largest for a stair-like distortion of the lattice.

Matveev. We limit our discussion to the case where exactly two channels enter
the dot and we discuss the role of an anisotropy between the transmission
coefficients (for these two channels) at the constriction. Experimentally, a
channel-anisotropy can be introduced applying a relatively weak in-plane
magnetic field to the system when only one ``orbital'' channel is open. The
magnetic field leads to different transmission amplitudes for spin-up and
spin-down electrons.
  In a strong magnetic field the anisotropic two-channel limit corresponds to
two (spin-polarized) orbital channels entering the dot.
  The physics of the charge fluctuations can be captured using a mapping on the
channel-anisotropic two-channel Kondo model. For the case of weak reflection at
the point contact this has already briefly been stressed by one of us in PRB
{\bf 64}, 161302R (2001). This mapping is also appropriate to discuss the
conductance behavior of a two-contact set-up in strong magnetic field.
  Here, we elaborate on this approach and also discuss an alternative solution
using a mapping on a channel-isotropic Kondo model. In addition we consider the
limit of weak transmission.
  We show that the Coulomb-staircase behavior of the charge in the dot as a
function of the gate voltage, is already smeared out by a small
channel-anisotropy both in the weak- and strong transmission limits.

symplectic geometry to $L_VY$, the bundle of vertically adapted linear frames

field momentum observables are vector-valued momentum mappings on the
vertically adapted frame bundle generated from automorphisms of $Y$. The
generalized symplectic geometry on $L_VY$ is a covering theory for
multisymplectic geometry on the multiphase space $Z$, and it follows that the
field momentum observables on $Z$ are generalized by those on $L_VY$.
Furthermore, momentum observables on $L_VY$ produce conserved quantities along
flows in $L_VY$. For translational and orthogonal symmetries of fields and
reparametrization symmetry in mechanics, momentum is conserved, and for angular
momentum in time-evolution mechanics we produce a version of the parallel axis
theorem of rotational dynamics, and in special relativity, we produce the
transformation of angular momentum under boosts.

composites can be calculated to arbitrary accuracy. An analytic answer for
yields is also known in the thermodynamic limit. In the range of temperature
and density considered in this work, the model has a phase transition. This
phase transition is first order. The analytic expression for yields of
composites, in the thermodynamic limit, does not conform to the expression
$<n_a>=a^{-\tau}f(a^{\sigma} (T-T_c))$ where, the usual identification would be
that $T_c$ is the critical temperature and $\tau,\sigma$ are critical
exponents. Nonetheless, for finite systems, we try to fit the yields with the
above expression. A minimisation procedure is adopted to get the parameters
$T_c,\tau$ and $\sigma$. While deviations from the formula are not negligible,
one might believe that the deviations are consistent with the corrections
attributable to finite particle number effects and might then conclude that one
has deduced at least approximately the values of critical parameters. This
exercise thus points to difficulties of trying to extract critical parameters
from data on nuclear disintegration. An interesting result is that the value of
$T_c$ deduced from the ``best'' fit is very close to the temperature at which
the first order phase transition occurs in the model. The yields calculated in
this model can also be fitted quite well by a parametrisation derived from a
droplet model.

steppermotors. Since the RS-232 specification is very broad and does not

major problems associated with the use of RS-232 is that the command protocol
for each device is unique. This makes it difficult to design generic drivers

This paper presents software developed independently at three other labs and
integrated into a single system at Jefferson Lab to handle serial devices in a

architecture including a common serial driver at the bottom, a top-level
protocol to specify individual device commands in a generic manner, and a
mid-level of software to ""glue"" the two together.

  Technology conference QIT5 held November 12th to 13th 2000 near Tokyo",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Quantum teleportation requires the transmission of entangled pairs to Alice
and Bob. Transmission errors modify the entangled state before the
teleportation can be performed. We determine the changes in the output state
caused by such transmission errors. It is shown that the errors caused by
entanglement transmission are equivalent to the errors caused in a direct
transmission of a quantum state from Alice to Bob.

and a ""target mode"", with a single circular Rydberg atom. In a third-order
Raman process, the atom emits a photon in the target while scattering one
photon from the source into the target. The final two-photon state is probed by
measuring by Ramsey interferometry the cavity light shifts induced by the
target field on the same atom. Extensions to other multi-photon processes and
to a new type of micromaser are briefly discussed.

Heisenberg_Weyl and SU(1,1) algebras are introduced. The interpolating states
are obtained as the coherent states of a closed and symmetric algebra which
interpolates between the two algebras. The overcompleteness of the
interpolating coherent states is established. Differential operator
representations in suitable spaces of entire functions are given for the
generators of the algebra. A nonsymmetric set of operators to realize the
Heisenberg-Weyl algebra is provided and the relevant coherent states are
studied.
