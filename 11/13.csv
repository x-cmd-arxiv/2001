spans ~ 5$^{\rm o}$ in diameter. The O VI $\lambda$1031.93 line is compared
with STIS observations of Si IV, C IV, and N V to examine the ionizing
mechanisms responsible for producing the high ion absorption, as well as to
study the processes by which gas is expelled into the halo. The O VI profile
spans a similar velocity range as the other highly ionized atoms, from -70 to
+80 km/s. Component fits reveal very broad absorption at the kinematic velocity
of the Scutum shell, which differs from the narrow Si IV, C IV, and N V
components, suggesting that these other species occupy a more confined region.
It is possible that the O VI is present in hot gas from the shell interior that
is diffusing into the high latitude region above it. The column density ratios
show that while the C IV and Si IV columns are amplified in this region, the
enhancement is not reflected in N V or O VI. We suggest that the ionic ratios
and column densities could be produced by ~ 150-200 turbulent mixing layers
lying in a fragmented medium above the polar cap of the superbubble. We note
through a sight line comparison that although these absorption characteristics
are similar to those near the center of Radio Loops I and IV, they differ
considerably from those near the edges of the loops. It is apparent that the
traits of high ion absorption in a supershell, as well as the ionizing

fast wind (CFW), with a previously blown asymptotic giant branch (AGB) slow
wind. Such jets (or CFWs) are supposedly formed when a compact companion, a
main sequence star or a white dwarf, accretes mass from the AGB star, forms an
accretion disk, and blows two jets. This type of flow, which is thought to
shape bipolar planetary nebulae (PNe), requires 3-dimensional gas dynamical
simulations, which are limited in the parameter space they can cover. By
imposing several simplifying assumptions, I derive simple expressions which
reproduce some basic properties of lobes in bipolar PNe, and which can be used
to guide future numerical simulations. I quantitatively apply the results to
two proto-PNe. I show that the jet interaction with the slow wind can form
lobes which are narrow close to, and far away from, the central binary system,
and which are wider somewhere in between. Jets that are recollimated and have
constant cross section can form cylindrical lobes with constant diameter, as
observed in several bipolar PNe. Close to their source, jets blown by main
sequence companions are radiative; only further out they become adiabatic,
i.e., they form high-temperature low-density bubbles that inflate the lobes.
This implies that radiative cooling must be incorporated in numerical codes
intended to study the formation of lobes in PNe.

some form of statistical correction for galaxies lying near the geometric
boundary of the sample. In this paper we compare three different methods of
performing such a correction upon estimates of the correlation integral in
order to assess the extent to which estimates may be biased by boundary terms.
We apply the corrections illustrative examples, including a simple fractal set
(L\'{e}vy flight), a random $\beta$-model, and a subset of the CfA2 Southern
Cap survey. This study shows that the new ``angular'' correction method we
present is more generally applicable than the other methods used to date: the
conventional ``capacity'' correction imposes a bias towards homogeneity, and
the ``deflation'' method discards large-scale information, and consequently
reduces the statistical usefulness of data sets. The ``angular'' correction
method is effective at recovering true fractal dimensions, although the extent
to which boundary corrections are important depends on the form of fractal
distribution assumed as well as the details of the survey geometry. We also
show that the CfA2 Southern sample does not show any real evidence of a
transition to homogeneity. We then revisit the IRAS PSCz survey and ``mock''
PSCz catalogues made using N-body simulations of two different cosmologies. The
results we obtain from the PSCz survey are not significantly affected by the
form of boundary correction used, confirming that the transition from fractal
to homogeneous behaviour reported by Pan & Coles (2000) is real.

and near-infrared color properties of the Cartwheel galaxy, we assume that an
intruder galaxy generates an expanding ring density wave in the Cartwheel's
disk, which in its turn triggers massive star formation along the wave's
perimeter according to the Schmidt law. We use the population synthesis to
calculate the color properties of stellar populations formed in the expanding
density wave. The results of color modelling suggest that the pre-collision
Cartwheel was a late-type spiral, embedded in an extensive gaseous disk of
sub-critical surface density. The properties of the old stellar disk are
typical for the late-type Freeman disks, with the central surface brightness in
V-band and the scale length being 21.0 mag arcsec^-2 and 2 kpc respectively.
The pre-collision gaseous disk has a metallicity gradient ranging from
z=z_sun/5 at the outer regions to z=z_sun in the central regions. At present,
the wave of star formation has passed the initial extent of the pre-collision,
old stellar disk and is currently moving in the predominantly gaseous,
low-metallicity disk at the radius of 16 kpc. Neither young stellar populations
formed in an expanding density wave, nor their mixture with the old,
pre-collision stellar populations can reproduce the B-V and V-K colors of the

A_{1g} in symmetry, formed primarily from the z^2 orbital on the Cu and p_z

Optimization of the c coordinate of the apical O's in the doped CuO_6

toward the central Cu. In particular, the O2 atom between the Cu and Sr is
displaced 0.26 A while the O2 atom between the Cu and La is displaced 0.10 A.
Contrary to expectations, investigation of a 0.1 A enhanced Jahn-Teller

instead leads to migration of the z^2 hole to the four other CuO_6 octahedra

interactions with an attractive well at a long distance, a repulsive soft-core
shoulder at an intermediate distance, and a hard-core repulsion at a short
distance, similar to potentials used to describe liquid systems such as
colloids, protein solutions, or liquid metals. We showed [Nature {\bf 409}, 692
(2001)] that, even with no evidences of the density anomaly, the phase diagram
has two first-order fluid-fluid phase transitions, one ending in a
gas--low-density liquid (LDL) critical point, and the other in a
gas--high-density liquid (HDL) critical point, with a LDL-HDL phase transition
at low temperatures. Here we use integral equation calculations to explore the
3-parameter space of the soft-core potential and we perform molecular dynamics
simulations in the interesting region of parameters. For the equilibrium phase
diagram we analyze the structure of the crystal phase and find that, within the
considered range of densities, the structure is independent of the density.
Then, we analyze in detail the fluid metastable phases and, by explicit
thermodynamic calculation in the supercooled phase, we show the absence of the
density anomaly. We suggest that this absence is related to the presence of
only one stable crystal structure.

true thermodynamic temperature $T$. We discuss carefully how correlation and
response functions need to be represented to obtain meaningful limiting FD
plots in {\em non-mean field} systems. A minimum requirement on the resulting
effective temperatures is that they should be independent of the observable
whose correlator and response are being considered; we show for two simple
models with glassy dynamics (Bouchaud's trap model and the Glauber-Ising chain
at zero temperature) that this is generically not the case. Consequences for
the wider applicability of effective temperatures derived from FD relations are
discussed; one intriguing possibility is that at least the limit of the FDT
violation factor for well separated times may generically be
observable-independent and so could yield a meaningful $\teff$.

gravitational field is connected with differential-geometric features of the
Riemannian manifold. It has not to be valid for alternative geometrical
structures. A teleparallel manifold is defined as a parallelizable
differentiable 4D-manifold endowed with a class of smooth coframe fields
related by global Lorentz, i.e., SO(1,3) transformations. In this article a
general free parametric class of teleparallel models is considered. It includes
a 1-parameter subclass of viable models with the Schwarzschild coframe
solution. A new form of the coframe field equation is derived from the general
teleparallel Lagrangian by introducing the notion of a 3-parameter conjugate
field strength $\F^a$. The field equation turns out to have a form completely
similar to the Maxwell field equation $d*\F^a=\T^a$. By applying the Noether
procedure, the source 3-form $\T^a$ is shown to be connected with the
diffeomorphism invariance of the Lagrangian. Thus the source $\T^a$ of the
coframe field is interpreted as the total conserved energy-momentum current.
The energy-momentum tensor for coframe is defined. The total energy-momentum
current of a system of a coframe and a material fields is conserved. Thus a
redistribution of the energy-momentum current between a material and a coframe
(gravity) fields is possible in principle, unlike as in the standard GR. For
special values of parameters, when the GR is reinstated, the energy-momentum
tensor gives up the invariant sense, i.e., becomes a pseudo-tensor. Thus even a
small-parametric change of GR turns it into a well defined Lagrangian theory.

with two observer independent scales (of speed and mass) that could replace the
standard Special Relativity at energies close to the Planck scale. Such a
theory might be a starting point in construction of quantum theory of
space-time. In this paper we investigate the quantum and statistical mechanical
consequences of such a proposal. We construct the generalized Newton--Wigner
operator and find relations between energy/momentum and frequency/wavevector
for position eigenstates of this operator. These relations indicate the
existence of a minimum length scale. Next we analyze the statistical mechanics
of the corresponding systems. We find that depending on the value of a
parameter defining the canonical commutational algebra one has to do either
with system with maximal possible temperature or with the one, which in the
high temperature limit becomes discrete.

complete, convex co-compact hyperbolic metric. For each hyperbolic metric $g$
on $M$ such that $\dr M$ is smooth and strictly convex, the induced metric on
$\dr M$ has curvature $K>-1$, and each such metric on $\dr M$ is obtained for a
unique choice of $g$. A dual statement is that, for each $g$ as above, the
third fundamental form of $\dr M$ has curvature $K<1$, and its closed geodesics
which are contractible in $M$ have length $L>2\pi$. Conversely, any such metric
on $\dr M$ is obtained for a unique choice of $g$.
  We are interested here in the similar situation where $\partial M$ is not
smooth, but rather looks locally like an ideal polyhedron in $H^3$. We can give
a fairly complete answer to the question on the third fundamental form -- which
in this case concerns the dihedral angles -- and some partial results about the
induced metric.

Teichmueller space of a surface with some marked points, or an extension of the
Koebe circle packing theorem to many 3-manifolds with boundary.

boundedness for a variety of operators assuming only a finite set of restricted
weak-type estimates. A typical situation occurs when one knows that a
multilinear operator satisfies a weak $L^q$ estimate for a single index $q$
(which may be less than one) and that all the adjoints of the multilinear
operator are of similar nature, and thus they also satisfy the same weak $L^q$
estimate. Under this assumption, in this expository note we give a general
multilinear interpolation theorem which allows one to obtain strong type
boundedness for the operator (and all of its adjoints) for a large set of
exponents. The key point in the applications we discuss is that the
interpolation theorem can handle the case $q \leq 1$. When $q > 1$, weak $L^q$
has a predual, and such strong type boundedness can be easily obtained by
duality and multilinear interpolation.

equations for Fermi liquids far from equilibrium. The emphasis is on the
consistent treatment of the off-shell motion between collisions and on the
non-instant and non-local picture of binary collisions. The resulting kinetic
equation is of the Boltzmann type, and it represents an interpolation between
the theory of transport in metals and the theory of moderately dense gases. The
free motion of particles is renormalised by various mean field and mass
corrections in the spirit of Landau's quasiparticles in metals. The collisions
are non-local in the spirit of Enskog's theory of non-ideal gases. The
collisions are moreover non-instant, a feature which is absent in the theory of
gases, but which is shown to be important for dense Fermi systems. In spite of
its formal complexity, the presented theory has a simple implementation within
the Monte-Carlo simulation schemes. Applications in nuclear physics are given
for heavy-ion reactions and the results are compared with the former theory and
recent experimental data. The effect of the off-shell motion and the non-local
and non-instant collisions on the dynamics of the system can be characterised
in terms of thermodynamic functions such as the energy density or the pressure
tensor. Non-equilibrium counterparts of these functions and the corresponding
balance equations are derived and discussed from two points of view. Firstly,
they are used to prove the conservation laws. Secondly, the role of individual
microscopic mechanisms in fluxes of particles and momenta and in
transformations of the energy is clarified.

terms of propensity rules for autoionization. As the photon energy is increased
the regular patterns are locally interrupted by perturber states until they
fade out indicating the progressive break-down of the propensity rules and the
underlying approximate quantum numbers. We demonstrate that the destructive
influence of isolated perturbers can be compensated with an energy-dependent

used to improve the performance of optomechanical devices. Considering the case
of a cavity mode coupled to an oscillating mirror by the radiation pressure, we
show how feedback can be used to reduce the position noise spectrum of the
mirror, cool it to its quantum ground state, or achieve position squeezing.
Then, we show that even though feedback is not able to improve the sensitivity
of stationary position spectral measurements, it is possible to design a
nonstationary strategy able to increase this sensitivity.

  Probability, and Bell's Theorem"", Cracow, Poland, 19.-23.8.01",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The usual formulation of quantum theory is rather abstract. In recent work I
have shown that we can, nevertheless, obtain quantum theory from five
reasonable axioms. Four of these axioms are obviously consistent with both
classical probability theory and quantum theory. The remaining axiom requires
that there exists a continuous reversible transformation between any two pure
states. The requirement of continuity rules out classical probability theory.
In this paper I will summarize the main points of this new approach. I will
leave out the details of the proof that these axioms are equivalent to the
usual formulation of quantum theory (for these see quant-ph/0101012).

"quant-ph/0111070","Antonio Cassa","Antonio Cassa","Quantum systems as classical systems","latex",,"10.1063/1.1402957",,"quant-ph",,"  A characteristical property of a classical physical theory is that the
observables are real functions taking an exact outcome on every (pure) state;
in a quantum theory, at the contrary, a given observable on a given state can
take several values with only a predictable probability. However, even in the
classical case, when an observer is intrinsically unable to distinguish between
some distinct states he can convince himself that the measure of its
''observables'' can have several values in a random way with a statistical
character. What kind of statistical theory is obtainable in this way? It is
possible, for example, to obtain exactly the statistical previsions of quantum
mechanics? Or, in other words, can a physical system showing a classical
behaviour appear to be a quantum system to a confusing observer? We show that
from a mathematical viewpoint it is not difficult to produce a theory with
hidden variables having this property. We don't even try to justify in physical
terms the artificial construction we propose; what we do is to give a general
and rigorous argument showing how the interplay between the classical and
quantum mechanics we offer is interpretable as the difference between an
imaginary very expert observer and another nonexpert observer. This proves also
that besides the well known theorems concerning the impossibility of hidden
variables (cfr. Von Neumann [Neu] and Jauch-Piron [J-P]) there is also room for
a result in favor of the possibility.

  in Nature","22 pages, 8 figures","International Journal of Theoretical Physics, 34, 1165, 1995","10.1007/BF00676227",,"quant-ph",,"  We explain the quantum structure as due to the presence of two effects, (a) a
real change of state of the entity under influence of the measurement and, (b)
a lack of knowledge about a deeper deterministic reality of the measurement
process. We present a quantum machine, where we can illustrate in a simple way
how the quantum structure arises as a consequence of the two mentioned effects.
We introduce a parameter epsilon that measures the size of the lack of
knowledge on the measurement process, and by varying this parameter, we
describe a continuous evolution from a quantum structure (maximal lack of
knowledge) to a classical structure (zero lack of knowledge). We show that for
intermediate values of epsilon we find a new type of structure, that is neither
quantum nor classical. We apply the model that we have introduced to situations
of lack of knowledge about the measurement process appearing in other regions
of reality. More specifically we investigate the quantum-like structures that
appear in the situation of psychological decision processes, where the subject
is influenced during the testing, and forms some of his opinions during the
testing process. Our conclusion is that in the light of this explanation, the
quantum probabilities are epistemic and not ontological, which means that
quantum mechanics is compatible with a determinism of the whole.

controversy in classical probability theory. Elga and D. Lewis argues that
Sleeping Beauty should have different credences for the result of a fair coin
toss in a particular situation. It is argued that when the coin is replaced by
a quantum coin, the credence is unambiguous and since one should not expect a
difference between classical and quantum coins, this provides a particular
resolution of the controversy. Second work is an analysis of a recent criticism
by Byrne and Hall of Everett-type approach presented by Chalmers. It is shown
that the criticism has no universal validity and that the Byrne and Hall
rejection of any Everett-type interpretation of quantum mechanics is unfounded.
