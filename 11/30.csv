equilibrium with two kinds of particles. We start from the partition function
in the canonical ensemble which we express as a functional integral over the
densities of the two kinds of particles for a large number of particles. The
system is shown to possess an infinite volume limit when (N_1,N_2,V)->infty,
keeping N_1/V^{1/3} and N_2/V^{1/3} fixed. The saddle point approximation
becomes here exact for (N_1,N_2,V)->infty.It provides a nonlinear differential
equation on the particle densities. For the spherically symmetric case, we
compute the densities as functions of two dimensionless physical parameters:
eta_1=G m_1^2 N_1/[V^{1/3} T] and eta_2=G m_2^2 N_2/[V^{1/3} T] (where G is
Newton's constant, m_1 and m_2 the masses of the two kinds of particles and T
the temperature). According to the values of eta_1 and eta_2 the system can be
either in a gaseous phase or in a highly condensed phase.The gaseous phase is
stable for eta_1 and eta_2 between the origin and their collapse values. The
gas is inhomogeneous and the mass M(R) inside a sphere of radius R scales with
R as M(R) propto R^d suggesting a fractal structure. The value of d depends in
general on eta_1 and eta_2 except on the critical line for the canonical ensem-
ble where it takes the universal value d simeq 1.6 for all values of N_1/N_2.
The equation of state is computed.It is found to be locally a perfect gas
equation of state. Thermodynamic functions are computed as functions of eta_1
and eta_2. They exhibit a square root Riemann sheet with the branch points on
the critical canonical line. This treatment is further generalized to the
self-gravitating gas with n-types of particles.

similar 151-MHz radio luminosity and redshifts to the radio galaxies studied at
1.3<z<2 by Archibald et al. (2001). We detect all bar one quasar at 850
microns, and five quasars are confirmed as dusty hyperluminous objects by
detections at shorter wavelengths. Our observations reveal a clear difference
between the submillimetre luminosity distributions of the radio quasars and a
matched sample of radio galaxies: the quasars are ~5-times brighter than the
radio galaxies and >~2-times brighter accounting for possible synchrotron
contamination. This difference is in quantitative agreement with a
receding-torus unified scheme for radio sources in which the torus opening
angle depends on quasar optical luminosity, provided that there is a close
relationship between the optical and submillimetre luminosities. The
implication is that quasar-heated dust dominates the submillimetre emission for
powerful radio quasars at z~1.5. We find a significant anti-correlation between
submillimetre/far-infrared luminosity L_FIR and radio source age in the sense
that hyperluminous quasars tend to be associated with young (<10^7 yr) sources.
This suggests that the processes controlling L_FIR are synchronized with the
jet-triggering event and that L_FIR declines on a ~10^7 yr timescale. There is
evidence for a small amount of obscuration in the hyperluminous quasars from
reddening and associated or broad absorption lines. We speculate that shortly
after jet triggering, dust is more widely distributed than at later times and
is heated by the quasar nucleus and/or a short-lived synchronized starburst.

merging galaxy pair, NGC 4038/4039 (``the Antennae''), we have obtained medium
and high resolution spectroscopy using ISAAC on VLT-UT1 and UVES on VLT-UT2 of
five such clusters. The velocity dispersions were estimated using the stellar
absorption features of CO at 2.29 microns and metal absorption lines at around
8500 \AA, including lines of the Calcium Triplet. The size scales and light
profiles were measured from HST images. From these data and assuming Virial
equilibrium, we estimated the masses of five clusters. The resulting masses
range from 6.5 x 10^5 to 4.7 x 10^6 M_sun. These masses are large, factor of a
few to more than 10 larger than the typical mass of a globular cluster in the
Milky Way. The mass-to-light ratios for these clusters in the V- and K-bands in
comparison with stellar synthesis models suggest that to first order the IMF
slopes are approximately consistent with Salpeter for a mass range of 0.1 to
100 M_sun. However, the clusters show a significant range of possible IMF
slopes or lower mass cut-offs and that these variations may correlate with the
interstellar environment of the cluster. Comparison with the results of
Fokker-Planck simulations of compact clusters with properties similar to the
clusters studied here, suggest that they are likely to be long-lived and may
lose a substantial fraction of their total mass. This mass loss would make the
star clusters obtain masses which are comparable to the typical mass of a
globular cluster.

magnetic helicity constraint in the presence of closed and open boundaries. In
the presence of closed or periodic boundaries, helical dynamos respond to the
helicity constraint by developing small scale separation in the kinematic
regime, and by showing long time scales in the nonlinear regime where the scale
separation has grown to the maximum possible value. A resistively limited
evolution towards saturation is also found at intermediate scales before the
largest scale of the system is reached. Larger aspect ratios can give rise to
different structures of the mean field which are obtained at early times, but
the final saturation field strength is still decreasing with decreasing
resistivity. In the presence of shear, cyclic magnetic fields are found whose
period is increasing with decreasing resistivity, but the saturation energy of
the mean field is in strong super-equipartition with the turbulent energy. It
is shown that artificially induced losses of small scale field of opposite sign
of magnetic helicity as the large scale field can, at least in principle,
accelerate the production of large scale (poloidal) field. Based on mean field
models with an outer potential field boundary condition in spherical geometry,
we verify that the sign of the magnetic helicity flux from the large scale
field agrees with the sign of alpha. For solar parameters, typical magnetic
helicity fluxes lie around 10^{47} Mx^2 per cycle.

determination of transport coefficients is attempted by calculating the
correlation matrix of different components of the field and its derivatives.
The alpha-effect operating on the toroidal field is found to be negative and of
similar magnitude as the value obtained previously by correlating the
electromotive force with the mean magnetic field. The turbulent diffusion of
the toroidal field is comparable to the kinematic viscosity that was determined
earlier by comparing the stress with the shear. However, the turbulent
diffusion of the radial field component is smaller and can even be formally
negative. The method is then modified to obtain the spectral dependence of the
turbulent transport coefficients on the wavenumber. There is evidence for
nonlocal behavior in that most of the response comes from the smallest
wavenumbers corresponding to the largest scale possible in the simulation.

powerfully, combined with other recent studies of C and N abundances in M71

X-ray emission is the signature of a highly magnetized pulsar wind that
prevents an internal MHD shock, at the location of the X-ray arc, from strongly
compressing the flow. The incomplete X-ray arc is consistent with beaming from
a relativistic equatorial outflow, while a surrounding radio shell is probably
the forward shock in the surrounding ISM. An MeV source at this location was
previously detected by the COMPTEL experiment on CGRO. This, plus the flat
X-ray spectrum in the 2-10 keV band, suggests that PSR J2229+6114 is one of the
brightest pulsars at 1 MeV, even while it is inconspicuous at radio through

  P. O. Slane and B. M. Gaensler",,,,"astro-ph",,"  G21.5-0.9 is a plerionic supernova remnant (SNR) whose properties hint at the
presence of a pulsar -- yet no pulsations have been found at any wavelength.
Early observations with Chandra led to the discovery of an extended component,
making the SNR at least twice as big as originally thought. Our analysis
indicates that this low-surface brightness extended component is non-thermal.
We perform a spatially resolved spectroscopy using a 72 ksec exposure with
ACIS-S, and find no evidence of line emission. The 5-arcminute diameter remnant
is well fitted with a power law with a photon index steepening from 1.5
(central core) to 2.7 (extended component) and a column density N_H=2.2 10^22
cm^-2. Using a 76 ksec exposure with the HRC, we derive an upper limit of 16%
on the pulsed fraction from a putative pulsar. We also infer the parameters of
the `hidden pulsar' in G21.5-0.9 in comparison with the Crab and 3C 58 pulsars.
This remnant remains unique and intriguing since it is, to date, the only
candidate whose size is bigger in X-rays than in the radio.

  Journal",,"10.1086/338882",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a model to determine the physical parameters of jets and hot spots
of a sample of CSOs under very basic assumptions like synchrotron emission and
minimum energy conditions. Based on this model we propose a simple evolutionary
scenario for these sources assuming that they evolve in ram pressure
equilibrium with the external medium and constant jet power. The parameters of
our model are constrained from fits of observational data (radio luminosity,
hot spot radius and hot spot advance speed) versus projected linear size. From
these plots we conclude that CSOs evolve self-similarly and that their radio
luminosity increases with linear size along the first kiloparsec. Assuming that
the jets feeding CSOs are relativistic from both kinematical and
thermodynamical points of view, we use the values of the pressure and particle
number density within the hot spots to estimate the fluxes of momentum
(thrust), energy, and particles of these relativistic jets. The mean jet power
obtained in this way is within an order of magnitude that inferred for FRII
sources, which is consistent with CSOs being the possible precursors of large
doubles. The inferred flux of particles corresponds to, for a barionic jet,
about a 10% of the mass accreted by a black hole of $10^8 {\rm M_{\odot}}$ at
the Eddington limit, pointing towards a very efficient conversion of accretion
flow into ejection, or to a leptonic composition of jets.

matter models is presented. It employs a robust statistics of voids, that was
recently applied to discriminate between data from the Las Campanas Redshift
Survey and different cosmological models. Here we extend the analysis to 3D and
show that typical void sizes D in the simulated galaxy samples obey a linear
scaling relation with the mean galaxy separation lambda: D=D_0+nu*lambda. It
has the same slope nu as in 2D, but with lower absolute void sizes. The scaling
relation is able to discriminate between different cosmologies. For the best
standard LCDM model, the slope of the scaling relation for voids in the dark
matter halos is too steep as compared to the LCRS, with too small void sizes
for well sampled data sets. The scaling relation of voids for dark matter halos
with increasing mass thresholds is even steeper than that for samples of
galaxy-mass halos where we sparse sample the data. This shows the stronger
clustering of more massive halos. Further, we find a correlation of the void
size to its central and environmental average density. While there is little
sign of an evolution in samples of small DM halos with v_{circ} ~ 90 km/s,
voids in halos with circular velocity over 200 km/s are larger at redshift z =
3 due to the smaller halo number density. The flow of dark matter from the
underdense to overdense regions in an early established network of large scale
structure is also imprinted in the evolution of the density profiles with a

strange stars we show that the onset of r-mode instability does not lead to the
thermo-gravitational runaway that is likely to occur in neutron stars. Instead,
the strange star evolves towards a quasi-equilibrium state on a timescale of
about a year. This mechanism could thus explain the clustering of
spin-frequencies inferred from kHz QPO data in Low-mass X-ray binaries. For
young strange stars we show that the r-mode driven spin-evolution is also
distinct from the neutron star case. In a young strange star the r-mode
undergoes short cycles of instability during the first few months. This is
followed by a quasi-adiabatic phase where the r-mode remains at a small,
roughly constant, amplitude for thousands of years. Another distinguishing
feature from the neutron star case is that the r-modes in a strange star never
grow to large amplitudes. Our results suggest that the r-modes in strange star
emit a persistent gravitational-wave signal that should be detectable with
large-scale interferometers given an observation time of a few months. If
detected, these signals would provide unique evidence for the existence of
strange stars, which would put useful constraints on the parameters of QCD.

dimensions of the harmonic measure) of a 2-parameter family of growth patterns
that result from a growth model that interpolates between Diffusion Limited
Aggregation (DLA) and Laplacian Growth Patterns in 2-dimensions. The two
parameters are \beta which determines the size of particles accreted to the
interface, and C which measures the degree of coverage of the interface by each
layer accreted to the growth pattern at every growth step. DLA and Laplacian
Growth are obtained at \beta=0, C=0 and \beta=2, C=1, respectively. The main
purpose of this paper is to show that there exists a line in the \beta-C phase
diagram that separates fractal (D<2) from non-fractal (D=2) growth patterns.
Moreover, Laplacian Growth is argued to lie in the non-fractal part of the
phase diagram. Some of our arguments are not rigorous, but together with the
numerics they indicate this result rather strongly. We first consider the
family of models obtained for \beta=0, C>0, and derive for them a scaling
relation D=2 * D_3. We then propose that this family has growth patterns for
which D=2 for some C>C_{cr}, where C_{cr} may be zero. Next we consider the
whole \beta-C phase diagram and define a line that separates 2-dimensional
growth patterns from fractal patterns with D<2. We explain that Laplacian
Growth lies in the region belonging to 2-dimensional growth patterns,
motivating the main conjecture of this paper, i.e. that Laplacian Growth

  Many natural and economical phenomena are described through power law or log-
normal distributions. In these cases, probability decreases very slowly with
step size compared to normal distribution. Thus it is essential to cut-off
these distributions for larger step size. Recently we introduce the gradually
truncated power law distribution to successfully describe variation of
financial, educational, physical and citation index. In the present work, we
introduce gradually truncated log-normal distribution in which we gradually
cut- off larger steps due to physical limitation of the system. We applied this
distribution successfully to size distribution of USA.\'{}s manufactoring firms
which is measured through their annual sell. The physical limitation are due to
limited market size or shortage of highly competent executives.

A near quadratic lower bound on quantum formula size, as well as a polynomial

  (really)",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis, a non-standard geometric framework, the ""quasi-metric""
framework (QMF), is used to define relativistic space-time. The QMF consists of
a 4-dimensional space-time manifold equipped with two one-parameter families of
Lorentzian 4-metrics ${\bf g}_t$ and ${\bf {\bar g}}_t$ parametrized by a
(unique) global time function $t$. The global time function represents one
extra degenerate time dimension and it defines a ""distinguished"" foliation of
quasi-metric space-time into spatial hypersurfaces. The metric family ${\bf
{\bar g}}_t$ is found as solutions of field equations, whereas the metric
family ${\bf g}_t$ is found via a local transformation ${\bf {\bar
g}}_t{\rightarrow}{\bf g}_t$ and is used in the equations of motion. The role
of the degenerate dimension is to describe global scale changes between
gravitational and non-gravitational systems. In particular, this yields an
alternative description of the expansion of the Universe. In this thesis, a
quasi-metric theory of gravity is constructed. Like General Relativity, the
field equations have two independent propagating dynamical degrees of freedom.
However, a number of non-standard features makes the field equations unsuitable
for a standard PPN-analysis. This implies that the experimental status of the
theory is not completely clear at this point in time. But the non-metric part
of the theory may be tested rather independently. That is, the theory predicts
that gravitational fields in vacuum and gravitationally bound bodies made of
ideal gas expand like the expansion of the Universe. Several observations
suggest this; e.g., the ""Pioneer effect"", the mean acceleration of the Moon,
the spin-down of the Earth, palaeo-tidal records, etc. Thus quasi-metric
relativity has experimental support where metric theories fail.

limited in their ability to duplicate all the effects of Einstein gravity they
nevertheless are extremely important -- they provide black hole analogues (some

a heavy quark. A description of nonperturbative effect related to $J/\psi$ can
be made by using NRQCD. In the forward region of the kinematics, the
interaction between the $c\bar c$-pair and the initial hadron is due to
exchange of soft gluons. The effect of the exchange can be studied by using the
expansion in the inverse of the quark mass $m_c$. At the leading order we find
that the nonperturbative effect related to the initial hadron is represented by
a matrix element of field strength operators, which are separated in the moving
direction of $J/\psi$ in the space-time. The S-matrix element is then obtained
without using perturbative QCD and the results are not based on any model.
Corrections to the results can be systematically added. Keeping the dominant
contribution of the S-matrix element in the large energy limit we find that the
imaginary part of the S-matrix element is related to the gluon distribution for
$x\to 0$ with a reasonable assumption, the real part can be obtained with
another approximation or with dispersion relation. Our approach is different
than previous approaches and also our results are different than those in these
approaches. The differences are discussed in detail. A comparison with
experiment is also made and a qualitative agreement is found.

the use of exhaustive computation of the neutrino oscillation probabilities and
the use of an improved statistical $\chi^2$ minimization.
  In the framework of two neutrino oscillations we conclude that the best fit
to the data is obtained in the LMA region with parameters $(\Delta m^2,
\tan^2\theta) = (5.2 \times 10^{-5} \eV^2, 0.47)$, ($\chi^2_{min}/n=0.82$,
$n=38$ degrees of freedom). Although less favored, solutions in the LOW and VAC
regions are still possible with a reasonable statistical significance. The best
possible solution in the SMA region gets as maximum a statistical significance
as low as $\sim 3%$.
  We study the implications of these results for the prospects of Borexino and
the possibility of discriminating between the different solutions. The expected
normalized Borexino signal is 0.62 at the best fit LMA solution while the DN
asymmetry is negligible (approximately $10^{-5}$). In the LOW region the signal
is in the range $\sim 0.6-0.7$ at 90% confidence level while the asymmetry is
$\simeq 1-20%$. As a consequence, the combined Borexino measurements of the
total event rate with a error below $\pm 5-10%$ and day-night total rate
asymmetry with a precision comparable to the one of SuperKamiokande, will have
a strong chance of distinguishing or at least strongly favoring one of the
Solar neutrino solutions provided by present data.

We determine the ratio $r \equiv \ngluon/\nq$ of multiplicities between gluon

$y$ is the proper distance in the extra dimension. This class includes the
Heterotic M-theory brane-world of Refs. \cite{ovrut,ekpy} and the
Randall-Sundrum (RS) model as a limiting case. In general, there are two moduli
fields $y_{\pm}$, corresponding to the ""positions"" of two branes (which live at
the fixed points of an orbifold compactification). Classically, the moduli are
massless, due to a scaling symmetry of the action. However, in the absence of
supersymmetry, they develop an effective potential at one loop. Local terms
proportional to $K_\pm^4$, where $K_\pm=q/y_\pm$ is the local curvature scale
at the location of the corresponding brane, are needed in order to remove the
divergences in the effective potential. Such terms break the scaling symmetry
and hence they may act as stabilizers for the moduli. When the branes are very
close to each other, the effective potential induced by massless bulk fields
behaves like $V\sim d^{-4}$, where $d$ is the separation between branes. When
the branes are widely separated, the potentials for each one of the moduli
generically develop a ""Coleman-Weinberg""-type behaviour of the form
$a^4(y_\pm)K_\pm^4 \ln(K_\pm/\mu_\pm)$, where $\mu_\pm$ are renormalization
scales. In the RS case, the bulk geometry is $AdS$ and $K_\pm$ are equal to a
constant, independent of the position of the branes, so these terms do not
contribute to the mass of the moduli. However, for generic warp factor, they
provide a simple stabilization mechanism. For $q\gtrsim 10$, the observed
hierarchy can be naturally generated by this potential, giving the lightest
modulus a mass of order $m_- \lesssim TeV$.

  the first part",,,,"math.DG math.SG",,"  This is the first part of an article in two parts, which builds the
foundation of a Floer-theoretic invariant, (I_F). (See math.DG/0505013 for part
II).
  The Floer homology can be trivial in many variants of the Floer theory; it is
therefore interesting to consider more refined invariants of the Floer complex.
We consider one such instance--the Reidemeister torsion (\tau_F) of the
Floer-Novikov complex of (possibly non-hamiltonian) symplectomorphisms.
(\tau_F) turns out NOT to be invariant under hamiltonian isotopies, but this
failure may be fixed by introducing certain ``correction term'': We define a
Floer-theoretic zeta function (\zeta_F), by counting perturbed
pseudo-holomorphic tori in a way very similar to the genus 1 Gromov invariant.
The main result of this article states that under suitable monotonicity
conditions, the product (I_F:=\tau_F\zeta_F) is invariant under hamiltonian
isotopies. In fact, (I_F) is invariant under general symplectic isotopies when
the underlying symplectic manifold (M) is monotone.
  Because the torsion invariant we consider is not a homotopy invariant, the
continuation method used in typical invariance proofs of Floer theory does not
apply; instead, the detailed bifurcation analysis is worked out. This is the
first time such analysis appears in the Floer theory literature in its
entirety.
  Applications of (I_F), and the construction of (I_F) in different versions of
Floer theories are discussed in sequels to this article.

field coherent state | \alpha> to a fan-state | \alpha, 2k>_F with k=2^{N-2}.

  Mode","12 pages, 9 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.65.043806",,"quant-ph",,"  We present a complete analytical solution for a single four-level atom
strongly coupled to a cavity field mode and driven by external coherent laser
fields. The four-level atomic system consists of a three-level subsystem in an
EIT configuration, plus an additional atomic level; this system has been
predicted to exhibit a photon blockade effect. The solution is presented in
terms of polaritons. An effective Hamiltonian obtained by this procedure is
analyzed from the viewpoint of an effective two-level system, and the dynamic
Stark splitting of dressed states is discussed. The fluorescence spectrum of
light exiting the cavity mode is analyzed and relevant transitions identified.

Casimir force, the accuracy of the theory is as important as the precision of
experiments. Here we evaluate the Casimir force when finite conductivity of the
reflectors and finite temperature are simultaneously taken into account. We
show that these two corrections are correlated, i.e. that they can not, in
principle, be evaluated separately and simply multiplied. We estimate the
correlation factor which measures the deviation from this common approximation.
We focus our attention on the case of smooth and plane plates with a metallic
optical response modeled by a plasma model.

Dirac Hamiltonians is constructed. This operator is such that the potential of
the second Dirac Hamiltonian as well as the corresponding eigenfunctions are
determined through the knowledge of only two eigenfunctions of the first Dirac

Hamiltonians generate a quadratic deformation of the superalgebra subtending
the usual supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Our developments are illustrated on
the free particle case and the generalized Coulomb interaction. In the latter
case, a relativistic counterpart of shape-invariance is observed.

multi-qubit Heisenberg model as a function of temperature and external magnetic
fields. Unlike the behaviors of the entanglement the violation can not be
obtained by increasing the temperature or the magnetic field. The threshold
temperatures of the violation are found be less than that of the entanglement.
We also consider a realistic cavity-QED model which is a special case of the
mutli-qubit Heisenberg model.
