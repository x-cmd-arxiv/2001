high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulations on scales below the mean

two fundamental limitations on those scales; the lack of the initial
fluctuation power and the finite mass resolution. We address this problem
applying the dark halo approach and are able to discuss separately how those
two limitations affect the dark matter clustering in $N$-body simulations at
early epochs. We find that limitations of the dark matter clustering are
primarily determined by the mass of particles. By a detailed comparison with
three major cosmological simulations, we also find that in order to reproduce a
proper amplitude of the dark matter clustering on small scales, halos with a
characteristic nonlinear mass, $M_{\rm NL}(z)$ defined by $\sigma_R(M_{\rm NL};
z)=1$, must be resolved in the simulation. This leads to a critical redshift
$z_{\rm crit}$ determined by $M_{\rm NL}(z_{\rm crit})=n_{\rm halo} m_{\rm
part}$ where $n_{\rm halo}$ is the number of particles necessary to resolve the
typical nonlinear mass halo ($\sim 10$). We conclude that, at least as far as
the two-point correlation functions are concerned, the dark matter clustering
in high-resolution $N$-body simulations on scales below the mean particle
separation is reliable down to the gravitational force resolution length only
for $z<z_{\rm crit}$, while it is strongly affected by the finite mass

images of the source in a ring-like configuration that surrounds the two,
resolved, lensing galaxies. B1608+656 was discovered as a double-lobed radio
source, and later identified as a post-starburst galaxy in the optical. Based
on photometry and optical spectroscopy we estimate that the stellar population
of the source has an age of $\sim$ 500 Myr. This provides a model for the
spectrum of the source that extends over spectral regions where no observations
are available, and is used to generate Tiny Tim PSFs for the filters.
Deconvolutions performed with the Lucy-Richardson method are presented, and the
limitations of these restorations is discussed. V$-$I and I$-$H color maps show
evidence of extinction by dust associated with one of the lensing galaxies, a
late type galaxy presumably disrupted after its close encounter with the other
lens, an elliptical galaxy. The extinction affects the two lens galaxies and
two of the four multiple images. The diagnostic of wavelength-dependent effects

revised distance to the object of ~400 pc is inferred. While these spectra do
not show either any change between the two epochs or any peculiar feature, the
X-ray spectra reveal a complex and long-term variable shape, with a clear soft
excess. The X-ray spectral properties of the source are best described by a
thermal Comptonization spectrum plus a soft energy(<1 keV) excess, which can be
modeled with a blackbody emission with kT_BB ~ 1 keV; the latter component is
not detected at the lowest source flux levels. The ratio between the two
components varies substantially with the source flux. The X-ray emission from
the object appears to become harder as its luminosity increases, and the RXTE
data acquired during an outburst occurred during Fall 1997 display a hard tail
detected up to 100 keV. Apart from erratic shot-noise variability on timescales
of tens to thousands of seconds, no significant pulsations or QPOs are found
from the timing analysis of the X-ray light curves. With the new distance
determination, the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity range spanned in the considered

spin) kagome-like lattice is studied by magnetic susceptibility, specific heat,

singlet ground states are detected down to 1.8 K, in spite of large
antiferromagnetic couplings of ~100 K between Cu spins forming a

represents a system close to a quantum critical point between classical
long-range ordered and quantum disordered phases.

the local vortex density was investigated in the mixed state of a high-$T_c$
superconductor, Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_y$, using a two-dimensional electron gas
(2DEG) micro-Hall probe array. We studied the cross-correlation function,
together with the auto-correlation function, both parallel and perpendicular to
the direction of flow of the vortices. The broadband noise (BBN) did not have
large spatial correlations. This suggests that the BBN is due to the
fluctuation of the local vortex density generated by bulk pinning centers under
the area of each probe. On the other hand, the narrow-band noise (NBN) (with
the the time scale of the transit time of vortices) had large translational
correlations. These definitely shows that the NBN was generated by
semimacroscopic imperfections like the surface, and macroscopic line defects
{\it etc.}. In relation to the dynamic phase diagram, large BBN was observed
when the vortices started moving. The dependence of the spatial correlations on
the direction of the array relative to the direction of the driving current
suggested that plastic flow was present when the large BBN was observed. The
gross features of our data agree well with some of the theoretically proposed
dynamical phase diagrams of vortices in superconductors.

Stability of a number of known gauges is investigated in the limit of

found to be ill-posed. A maximal slicing gauge and its parabolic extension are
shown to be ill-posed as well. A necessary condition is derived for
well-posedness of metric-dependent algebraic gauges. Well-posed
metric-dependent gauges are found, however, to be generally unstable. Both

examined. Due to the non-compact extra dimension, the perturbation spectrum has
no mass gap, and the long wavelength effective theory is only understood
perturbatively. The full 5-dimensional Einstein equations are solved
numerically for static, spherically symmetric matter localized on the brane,
yielding regular geometries in the bulk with axial symmetry. An elliptic
relaxation method is used, allowing both the brane and asymptotic radiation
boundary conditions to be simultaneously imposed. The same data that specifies
stars in 4-dimensional gravity, uniquely constructs a 5-dimensional solution.
The algorithm performs best for small stars (radius less than the AdS length)
yielding highly non-linear solutions. An upper mass limit is observed for these
small stars, and the geometry shows no global pathologies. The geometric
perturbation is shown to remain localized near the brane at high densities, the
confinement interestingly increasing for both small and large stars as the
upper mass limit is approached. Furthermore, the static spatial sections are
found to be approximately conformal to those of AdS. We show that the intrinsic
geometry of large stars, with radius several times the AdS length, is described
by 4-dimensional General Relativity far past the perturbative regime. This
indicates that the non-linear long wavelength effective action remains local,
even though the perturbation spectrum has no mass gap. The implication is that
Randall-Sundrum gravity, with localized brane matter, reproduces relativistic
astrophysical solutions, such as neutron stars and massive black holes,
consistent with observation.

$X_\Gamma^{[n]}$ (where $X=\C^2$, $\Gamma\subset SL(\C^2)$ is a finite
subgroup, and $X_\Gamma$ is a minimal resolution of $X/\Gamma$) are quiver
varieties for the affine Dynkin graph, corresponding to $\Gamma$ via the McKay
correspondence, the same dimension vectors, but different parameters $\zeta$
(for earlier results in this direction see [4, 12, 13]). In particular, it
follows that the varieties $X^{\Gamma[n]}$ and $X_\Gamma^{[n]}$ are
diffeomorphic. Computing their cohomology (in the case $\Gamma=\Z/d\Z$) via the
fixed points of $(\C^*\times\C^*)$-action we deduce the following combinatorial
identity: the number $UCY(n,d)$ of uniformly coloured in d colours Young
diagrams consisting of nd boxes coincides with the number $CY(n,d)$ of
collections of d Young diagrams with the total number of boxes equal to n.

serial connection to a PMC mezzanine module. With no processor intervention,
all data sources in the remote chassis are read at 100 microsec intervals,
timestamped, and stored in a 2 MB circular buffer on the PMC module. In
operation, the memory always contains the most recent 16k samples of 10 kHz
data from all 64 analog input channels. An expansion module that resides in the
HRM chassis records snapshot data for 8 analog channels, each channel
consisting of up to 16k readings, digitized at rates up to 10 MHz. Snapshot
data is also returned and stored in buffers on the PMC module. Because the HRM
presents a memory-mapped interface to the host, it is independent of the
operating system and may be used in any system that supports PMC mezzanine
modules.
